This clock was unveiled in 1984 to celebrate the centenary of Marks & Spencer.  In 2012 Marks and Spencer returned to Kirkgate Market, opening a stall alongside the centenary clock.\n\nIn 1904, Marks & Spencer relocated its Leeds branch to the then recently opened Cross Arcade (now part of the [[Victoria Quarter]]).\n\nIn 2009, over 60,000 historic artefacts concerning Marks & Spencer were relocated from London to the Centenary Gallery in the [[Parkinson Building]] at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref name=\"Born\"/>\n\n===A new ornate hall===\n[[File:1904 Hall, Kirkgate Market, Leeds, West Yorkshire (Taken by Flickr user 27th February 2012).jpg|thumb|right|The 1904 hall]]\nIn 1893, Leeds gained city status, which brought an increased desire amongst members of the corporation to build civic buildings that befitted this status.  The area around the market was made up of [[abattoir]]s and [[slums]] making it appear less than salubrious.  A design competition was held to find an architect capable of designing an opulent new hall to the front of the market.  A prize of \u00a3150 was set for the winner, which (following allegations of corruption in the competition) was awarded to Joseph and John Leeming of London.  Despite misgivings about the award of the design, the plans went ahead and the corporation budgeted \u00a380,000 for building the new hall.<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>   J Bagshaw and Sons of [[Batley]] were chosen as engineers for the project.<ref name=\"imagesofengland.org.uk\">{{NHLE |num=1255765 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFurther controversy was generated when, in May 1901, many traders within the markets were given one week's notice to vacate their stalls so that work on the new hall could commence.  Traders demanded compensation for loss of trade, fixtures and fittings.<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe new hall opened in 1904, costing \u00a3116,700, somewhat more than the original budget of \u00a380,000.  A ceremony in July of that year conducted by Mr G. W. Balfour, MP for Leeds Central and President of the Board of Trade, marked the new hall's opening.<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Second World War===\nDespite the [[Second World War]] bringing problems such as conscription and air-raids (although the latter became a rare occurrence in Leeds) the markets continued to trade, albeit on a smaller scale.  Air-raid shelters were built at the site for market traders and an [[Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) service was operated by over 100 volunteers from the market site.  The [[Ministry of Food]] operated offices at the market to implement [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]].  On 14 March 1941 the markets were damaged in a bombing raid on Leeds.  The damage was limited and the markets continued to trade.\n\n===Post-war developments===\nAfter the war, the Markets Committee proposed a \u00a355,000 development at the market.  New warehouses were provided as well as an open market and car parking.  Twenty new butchers' shops were built, older shops were refurbished, and several older buildings were demolished.\n\n===1950s and 60s development and opening of competing facilities===\nIn 1956 it was found that upgrading the shops to meet modern hygiene regulations was impractical, so new shops were built creating Butchers' Row and the Fish and Game Row.\n\nBy the 1950s the market had over 400 traders and over 100,000 shoppers visited the complex every Saturday.  To relieve this problem, the council bought a site off Pontefract Lane in [[Cross Green, Leeds|Cross Green]] to accommodate a new wholesale market.  This market was itself closed in 2009 over concerns that it was being used to sell counterfeit goods.\n\nWith the opening of the [[Merrion Centre, Leeds|Merrion Centre]] in the 1960s the market had to compete with the newer but smaller Merrion Market (then Merrion Superstore).  In recent years the Merrion Markets have closed and the Kirkgate Markets have regained their dominance in Leeds City Centre.\n\n===1975 fire===\nOn 13 December 1975 a fire broke out in the market hall.  The cause of the fire has never been determined, although stallholders have speculated over several causes including an electrical fault and an overturned paraffin heater.  Attempts made to extinguish the fire by stallholders were to prove fruitless.  By the time over 100 firefighters had extinguished the fire, most of the roof had collapsed.  The ornate 1904 market hall was completely undamaged by the fire and a small part of the 1875 hall survived, however an estimated \u00a37 million worth of damage was done to other halls.  Traders who had lost their stalls were accommodated in other parts of the city centre until replacement halls were built at the Kirkgate site.  After only three days of closure, undamaged parts of the Markets reopened.\n\n===Rebuilding 1976-81===\n[[File:Kirkgate Market (4th May 2010) 012.jpg|thumb|right|A view from the 1981 hall through to the 1976 hall.]]\nFollowing the destruction of most of the market hall in the fire of 1975, significant rebuilding works had to take place in order to re-accommodate displaced traders.  Shortly after the fire, in 1976, the first replacement hall opened in the north-east corner of the complex.  Unlike the ornate 1904 hall or the stone-built 1875 hall (little of which remained), the 1975 hall was a large open hall, built of steel sheets with a lattice roof structure.  In 1981 the second of these halls opened, built in identical style in the south-east corner of the market.  The two halls appear to be one from the outside with no join, but they are separated by a dividing wall inside.\n\n===1986 redevelopment proposals===\nIn 1986 a proposal was put forward by [[Leeds City Council]] with Dutch developers MAB(UK) and [[Norwich Union]] as major investors.  The plans involved retaining the 1875 and 1904 Halls, but replacing the rest with a new single market hall, new shops, a new bus station and multi-storey car park.  The plans proved unpopular with the local population and were opposed by the Market Traders' Association and [[Leeds Civic Trust]]. Despite these misgivings the council granted the scheme planning permission and sought to push on with plans.  In order to see the plans through, a [[compulsory purchase order]] was required by the council and this was refused by the [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].  The plans were formally dropped in 1990, leaving the council again with the dilemma of what to do with the increasingly dilapidated market halls<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>\n\n===1991 refurbishment===\nFollowing the cancellation of the 1986 proposals, a new solution was sought.  Leeds City Council, again with Norwich Union as investors, proposed a more modest refurbishment plan which was soon formally approved.  Work commenced in 1991.  The exterior stonework and lead roof were repaired and adjoining shops were rebuilt.  The entrances to the 1904 hall were refurbished with ornate iron work in keeping with the original design.  The previously underused upper floors were refurbished to provide modern office space.  The 1904 hall was redecorated in line with its original style and new stalls were built in a similar style.  The services to the buildings were modernised with new electric and water supplies installed, along with new fire and security services.  Drainage and ventilation to the building were also improved.\n\nThe refurbishment works were set back in 1992 after a fire broke out in one of the domes at the Vicar Lane end of the 1904 hall, resulting in the dome having to be rebuilt.\n\nFollowing this refurbishment Kirkgate Market was upgraded from a Grade II to a [[Grade I listed building]].<ref name=\"PickLeeds\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/leeds/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8487000/8487926.stm|title=Take your pick of Leeds' markets: Kirkgate Market|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1995 refurbishment===\n[[File:Fish & Game Row, Kirkgate Market, Leeds (22nd September 2012) 001.JPG|thumb|right|Fish and Game Row was refurbished in the 1995 round.]]\nBy the 1990s it was becoming apparent that the parts of the 1875 hall to survive the 1975 fire were becoming increasingly dilapidated.  Work began repairing this area in 1995.  The roof, which had fallen into significant disrepair was repaired and the internal stonework was refurbished in keeping with the original Victorian style of the hall.\n\n===1996 developments===\nIn 1996 the outdoor market was redeveloped with new market stalls being erected, along with a new central square.  At about this time a [[Leeds City bus station|new bus station]] was built at the eastern end of the outdoor market and a new multi-storey car park was built to the southern side of the outdoor market.\n\n===Victoria Gate (formerly Eastgate Quarters) and 2010 redevelopment proposals===\nLeeds City Council has been proposing to reduce the size of the Kirkgate Markets to make it more viable and refurbish in a way that will complement the proposed new shopping centre [[Eastgate Quarters]] to be built immediately adjacent to the Market. Proposals to reduce the size have been met with opposition from market traders. Moreover, in March 2010\n<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Meeting: Save our Market |url=http://kirkgatemarket.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/public-event-discussing-the-future-of-kirkgate-market/ |publisher=Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> a new group, Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market, was launched, among whose aims <ref>{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://kirkgatemarket.wordpress.com/about-us/ |publisher=Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market |date= March 2010 |accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> are to defend the Market and to promote it. In the last years this group has organised a petition, many initiatives and public meeting in support of the Market.\n[[File:Signage between Victoria Gate (John Lewis) & Kirkgate Market.jpg|thumb|Victoria Gate is now directly across the road]]'''2016 update''': from late 2016 Victoria Gate will be trading next to the market, and the Council plans to capitalise on this change in focus include remodelling to provide a new fresh and street food market area including an event space open from June 2016.\n\n==Buildings==\nThe current building frontage opened in 1904.  Fire ravaged the rear halls in December 1975 and these were rebuilt soon after, giving the rear halls a more modern open-plan feel, albeit lacking the character of the 1904 hall.  To the very rear of the site there is an outdoor market.  Crammed in between the 1904 hall and the rear modern halls is the oldest hall, from 1875, which contains both Butchers' Row and Fish and Game Row.  The 1875 hall is not an open hall, as the others but acts as a series of passages between the 1904 hall and the more modern 1976 and 1981 halls.\n\n===1875 Hall===\n[[File:Butchers' Row, 1875 Hall, Kirkgate Market, Leeds (22nd September 2012) 001.jpg|thumb|right|Butchers' Row, 1875 Hall]]\nThe 1875 Hall is situated between the 1904 hall and the later 1976 and 1981 halls.  To the northern end of this hall is Butchers' Row which leads to the 1976 Hall; to the southern end is Fish and Game Row, which leads to the 1981 Hall.  In between the two rows, various stalls are situated and can be accessed from the rear of the 1904 hall.  The 1875 hall can only be accessed via the other four halls and has no entrances from the street of its own.  Little of the 1875 Hall can be seen from the outside except from above.  Prior to the fire of 1975, much more of the 1875 hall existed; the fire however caused much of this to completely collapse, hence the hall's disjointed feel these days.\n\n===1904 Hall===\n[[File:Kirkgate Market interior 002.jpg|thumb|right|The 1904 Hall seen from the perimeter balcony.]]\n[[File:Cake 1904 market all.jpg|thumb|1904 hall celebrated in cake (2016 Leeds Indie Food Festival)]]\nThe 1904 Hall is the most ornate of the halls and is situated at the front of the complex.  The hall has a glass roof and is surrounded by a balcony, which runs the full perimeter of the hall.  The roof and balcony are supported by a number of cast-iron structural pillars.<ref name=\"imagesofengland.org.uk\"/>  The exterior of the hall is ornately decorated and provides the main entrances to the complex.  The hall contains a mixture of stalls and interconnects with the 1976 and 1981 halls via the 1875 Hall.  In the centre of the hall is the Market Clock, albeit a replacement for the original which now stands in [[Oakwood, Leeds|Oakwood]].  The front of the hall is lined with shops which face onto Vicar Lane, while the upper floors which run in a 'U' shape along the northern, southern and western sides, contain private offices.  The 1904 hall, is the only part of the complex to survive the 1975 fire in its entirety.  The hall was first listed in 1973.<ref name=\"imagesofengland.org.uk\"/>\n\n===1976 Hall===\nThe 1976 Hall is connected to the older halls via Butchers' Row.  It replaced earlier buildings destroyed in the 1975 fire.  It is a large open-plan hall, constructed from sheet steel with a lattice roof structure.  Unlike earlier halls it has no supporting pillars.  From the outside it is indistinguishable from the 1981 hall, but is separated by a dividing wall.  There are a variety of different stall types in this hall. The 1976 hall closed for Refurbishment in February 2015. The completion is to finish in November 2015, many traders have temporally moved to other stalls.\n\n===1981 Hall===\nThe 1981 hall is situated in the south-eastern corner of the complex and is almost identical to the 1975 hall from which it is separated by a partition wall.  Like the 1975 hall, a variety of different types of stall holders occupy this hall.\n\n===Open Market===\n[[File:Kirkgate Market (4th May 2010) 015.jpg|thumb|right|The Open Market with the Markets Multi-Storey in the background.]]\nThe open market situated to the rear is accessible via the 1976 and 1981 halls.  There are three blocks of stalls, denoted by the colour of their roofs (blue, red and yellow) with green-roofed stalls at the bottom.  The open market is surrounded by a brick wall, with lockable gates.  A variety of types of stallholders occupy the open market.  Towards the bottom end it is mostly occupied by [[greengrocers]], however the other rows include many stalls selling electrical goods, computers and clothing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Architecture of Leeds]]\n*[[Charter]]\n*[[History of marketing]]\n*[[Marketplace]]\n*[[Market town]]\n*[[Retail]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |first=Derek |last=Fraser |authorlink= |title=The History of Modern Leeds|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-7190-0781-1|ref={{SfnRef|Fraser|1982}}}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kirkgate Market}}\n*[http://www.leedsmarkets.co.uk/ Official Leeds City Council Markets Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032459/http://www.leeds.gov.uk/discover/discovery.asp?page=200335_414959133 Discovering Leeds - Markets]\n*[http://kirkgatemarket.wordpress.com/ Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market]\n\n{{Listed buildings in Leeds}}\n{{coord|53.7972|-1.5397|display=title|region:GB_scale:2000}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Leeds]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in West Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed markets and exchanges]]\n[[Category:Listed buildings in Leeds]]\n[[Category:Retail markets in England]]\n[[Category:Retailing in Leeds]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox Historic building\n|image= File:Leeds City Markets 24 June 2018 2.jpg\n|caption= Entrance at corner of Vicar Lane (left) and Kirkgate (right)\n|name= Kirkgate Market\n|location_town= [[Leeds]]\n|location_country= [[England]]\n|architect=  Joseph and John Leeming of London (1904 hall)\n|client= \n|engineer=J Bagshaw and Sons of Batley (1904 hall)\n| coordinates         = \n| map_type            = \n|construction_start_date= 1875\n|completion_date= 1981, 1976 hall refurbished 2016\n\n|structural_system=\n|style= various\n}}\n\n'''Leeds Kirkgate Market''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u025d\u02d0|g|\u0259|t|}}) is a [[Market (place)|market]] in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] located on Vicar Lane.

Despite misgivings about the award of the design, the plans went ahead and the corporation budgeted \u00a380,000 for building the new hall.<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>   J Bagshaw and Sons of [[Batley]] were chosen as engineers for the project.<ref name=\"imagesofengland.org.uk\">{{NHLE |num=1255765 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFurther controversy was generated when, in May 1901, many traders within the markets were given one week's notice to vacate their stalls so that work on the new hall could commence.  Traders demanded compensation for loss of trade, fixtures and fittings.<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe new hall opened in 1904, costing \u00a3116,700, somewhat more than the original budget of \u00a380,000.  A ceremony in July of that year conducted by Mr G. W. Balfour, MP for Leeds Central and President of the Board of Trade, marked the new hall's opening.<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Second World War===\nDespite the [[Second World War]] bringing problems such as conscription and air-raids (although the latter became a rare occurrence in Leeds) the markets continued to trade, albeit on a smaller scale.  Air-raid shelters were built at the site for market traders and an [[Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) service was operated by over 100 volunteers from the market site.  The [[Ministry of Food]] operated offices at the market to implement [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]].  On 14 March 1941 the markets were damaged in a bombing raid on Leeds.  The damage was limited and the markets continued to trade.\n\n===Post-war developments===\nAfter the war, the Markets Committee proposed a \u00a355,000 development at the market.  New warehouses were provided as well as an open market and car parking.  Twenty new butchers' shops were built, older shops were refurbished, and several older buildings were demolished.\n\n===1950s and 60s development and opening of competing facilities===\nIn 1956 it was found that upgrading the shops to meet modern hygiene regulations was impractical, so new shops were built creating Butchers' Row and the Fish and Game Row.\n\nBy the 1950s the market had over 400 traders and over 100,000 shoppers visited the complex every Saturday.  To relieve this problem, the council bought a site off Pontefract Lane in [[Cross Green, Leeds|Cross Green]] to accommodate a new wholesale market.  This market was itself closed in 2009 over concerns that it was being used to sell counterfeit goods.\n\nWith the opening of the [[Merrion Centre, Leeds|Merrion Centre]] in the 1960s the market had to compete with the newer but smaller Merrion Market (then Merrion Superstore).  In recent years the Merrion Markets have closed and the Kirkgate Markets have regained their dominance in Leeds City Centre.\n\n===1975 fire===\nOn 13 December 1975 a fire broke out in the market hall.  The cause of the fire has never been determined, although stallholders have speculated over several causes including an electrical fault and an overturned paraffin heater.  Attempts made to extinguish the fire by stallholders were to prove fruitless.  By the time over 100 firefighters had extinguished the fire, most of the roof had collapsed.  The ornate 1904 market hall was completely undamaged by the fire and a small part of the 1875 hall survived, however an estimated \u00a37 million worth of damage was done to other halls.  Traders who had lost their stalls were accommodated in other parts of the city centre until replacement halls were built at the Kirkgate site.  After only three days of closure, undamaged parts of the Markets reopened.\n\n===Rebuilding 1976-81===\n[[File:Kirkgate Market (4th May 2010) 012.jpg|thumb|right|A view from the 1981 hall through to the 1976 hall.]]\nFollowing the destruction of most of the market hall in the fire of 1975, significant rebuilding works had to take place in order to re-accommodate displaced traders.  Shortly after the fire, in 1976, the first replacement hall opened in the north-east corner of the complex.  Unlike the ornate 1904 hall or the stone-built 1875 hall (little of which remained), the 1975 hall was a large open hall, built of steel sheets with a lattice roof structure.  In 1981 the second of these halls opened, built in identical style in the south-east corner of the market.  The two halls appear to be one from the outside with no join, but they are separated by a dividing wall inside.\n\n===1986 redevelopment proposals===\nIn 1986 a proposal was put forward by [[Leeds City Council]] with Dutch developers MAB(UK) and [[Norwich Union]] as major investors.  The plans involved retaining the 1875 and 1904 Halls, but replacing the rest with a new single market hall, new shops, a new bus station and multi-storey car park.  The plans proved unpopular with the local population and were opposed by the Market Traders' Association and the Leeds Civic Trust.  Despite these misgivings the council granted the scheme planning permission and sought to push on with plans.  In order to see the plans through, a [[compulsory purchase order]] was required by the council and this was refused by the [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].  The plans were formally dropped in 1990, leaving the council again with the dilemma of what to do with the increasingly dilapidated market halls<ref name=\"leedsmarkets.co.uk\"/>\n\n===1991 refurbishment===\nFollowing the cancellation of the 1986 proposals, a new solution was sought.  Leeds City Council, again with Norwich Union as investors, proposed a more modest refurbishment plan which was soon formally approved.  Work commenced in 1991.  The exterior stonework and lead roof were repaired and adjoining shops were rebuilt.  The entrances to the 1904 hall were refurbished with ornate iron work in keeping with the original design.  The previously underused upper floors were refurbished to provide modern office space.  The 1904 hall was redecorated in line with its original style and new stalls were built in a similar style.  The services to the buildings were modernised with new electric and water supplies installed, along with new fire and security services.  Drainage and ventilation to the building were also improved.\n\nThe refurbishment works were set back in 1992 after a fire broke out in one of the domes at the Vicar Lane end of the 1904 hall, resulting in the dome having to be rebuilt.\n\nFollowing this refurbishment Kirkgate Market was upgraded from a Grade II to a [[Grade I listed building]].<ref name=\"PickLeeds\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/leeds/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8487000/8487926.stm|title=Take your pick of Leeds' markets: Kirkgate Market|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===1995 refurbishment===\n[[File:Fish & Game Row, Kirkgate Market, Leeds (22nd September 2012) 001.JPG|thumb|right|Fish and Game Row was refurbished in the 1995 round.]]\nBy the 1990s it was becoming apparent that the parts of the 1875 hall to survive the 1975 fire were becoming increasingly dilapidated.  Work began repairing this area in 1995.  The roof, which had fallen into significant disrepair was repaired and the internal stonework was refurbished in keeping with the original Victorian style of the hall.\n\n===1996 developments===\nIn 1996 the outdoor market was redeveloped with new market stalls being erected, along with a new central square.  At about this time a [[Leeds City bus station|new bus station]] was built at the eastern end of the outdoor market and a new multi-storey car park was built to the southern side of the outdoor market.\n\n===Victoria Gate (formerly Eastgate Quarters) and 2010 redevelopment proposals===\nLeeds City Council has been proposing to reduce the size of the Kirkgate Markets to make it more viable and refurbish in a way that will complement the proposed new shopping centre [[Eastgate Quarters]] to be built immediately adjacent to the Market. Proposals to reduce the size have been met with opposition from market traders. Moreover, in March 2010\n<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Meeting: Save our Market |url=http://kirkgatemarket.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/public-event-discussing-the-future-of-kirkgate-market/ |publisher=Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> a new group, Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market, was launched, among whose aims <ref>{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://kirkgatemarket.wordpress.com/about-us/ |publisher=Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market |date= March 2010 |accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> are to defend the Market and to promote it. In the last years this group has organised a petition, many initiatives and public meeting in support of the Market.\n[[File:Signage between Victoria Gate (John Lewis) & Kirkgate Market.jpg|thumb|Victoria Gate is now directly across the road]]'''2016 update''': from late 2016 Victoria Gate will be trading next to the market, and the Council plans to capitalise on this change in focus include remodelling to provide a new fresh and street food market area including an event space open from June 2016.\n\n==Buildings==\nThe current building frontage opened in 1904.  Fire ravaged the rear halls in December 1975 and these were rebuilt soon after, giving the rear halls a more modern open-plan feel, albeit lacking the character of the 1904 hall.  To the very rear of the site there is an outdoor market.  Crammed in between the 1904 hall and the rear modern halls is the oldest hall, from 1875, which contains both Butchers' Row and Fish and Game Row.  The 1875 hall is not an open hall, as the others but acts as a series of passages between the 1904 hall and the more modern 1976 and 1981 halls.\n\n===1875 Hall===\n[[File:Butchers' Row, 1875 Hall, Kirkgate Market, Leeds (22nd September 2012) 001.jpg|thumb|right|Butchers' Row, 1875 Hall]]\nThe 1875 Hall is situated between the 1904 hall and the later 1976 and 1981 halls.  To the northern end of this hall is Butchers' Row which leads to the 1976 Hall; to the southern end is Fish and Game Row, which leads to the 1981 Hall.  In between the two rows, various stalls are situated and can be accessed from the rear of the 1904 hall.  The 1875 hall can only be accessed via the other four halls and has no entrances from the street of its own.  Little of the 1875 Hall can be seen from the outside except from above.  Prior to the fire of 1975, much more of the 1875 hall existed; the fire however caused much of this to completely collapse, hence the hall's disjointed feel these days.\n\n===1904 Hall===\n[[File:Kirkgate Market interior 002.jpg|thumb|right|The 1904 Hall seen from the perimeter balcony.]]\n[[File:Cake 1904 market all.jpg|thumb|1904 hall celebrated in cake (2016 Leeds Indie Food Festival)]]\nThe 1904 Hall is the most ornate of the halls and is situated at the front of the complex.  The hall has a glass roof and is surrounded by a balcony, which runs the full perimeter of the hall.  The roof and balcony are supported by a number of cast-iron structural pillars.<ref name=\"imagesofengland.org.uk\"/>  The exterior of the hall is ornately decorated and provides the main entrances to the complex.  The hall contains a mixture of stalls and interconnects with the 1976 and 1981 halls via the 1875 Hall.  In the centre of the hall is the Market Clock, albeit a replacement for the original which now stands in [[Oakwood, Leeds|Oakwood]].  The front of the hall is lined with shops which face onto Vicar Lane, while the upper floors which run in a 'U' shape along the northern, southern and western sides, contain private offices.  The 1904 hall, is the only part of the complex to survive the 1975 fire in its entirety.  The hall was first listed in 1973.<ref name=\"imagesofengland.org.uk\"/>\n\n===1976 Hall===\nThe 1976 Hall is connected to the older halls via Butchers' Row.  It replaced earlier buildings destroyed in the 1975 fire.  It is a large open-plan hall, constructed from sheet steel with a lattice roof structure.  Unlike earlier halls it has no supporting pillars.  From the outside it is indistinguishable from the 1981 hall, but is separated by a dividing wall.  There are a variety of different stall types in this hall. The 1976 hall closed for Refurbishment in February 2015. The completion is to finish in November 2015, many traders have temporally moved to other stalls.\n\n===1981 Hall===\nThe 1981 hall is situated in the south-eastern corner of the complex and is almost identical to the 1975 hall from which it is separated by a partition wall.  Like the 1975 hall, a variety of different types of stall holders occupy this hall.\n\n===Open Market===\n[[File:Kirkgate Market (4th May 2010) 015.jpg|thumb|right|The Open Market with the Markets Multi-Storey in the background.]]\nThe open market situated to the rear is accessible via the 1976 and 1981 halls.  There are three blocks of stalls, denoted by the colour of their roofs (blue, red and yellow) with green-roofed stalls at the bottom.  The open market is surrounded by a brick wall, with lockable gates.  A variety of types of stallholders occupy the open market.  Towards the bottom end it is mostly occupied by [[greengrocers]], however the other rows include many stalls selling electrical goods, computers and clothing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Architecture of Leeds]]\n*[[Charter]]\n*[[History of marketing]]\n*[[Marketplace]]\n*[[Market town]]\n*[[Retail]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |first=Derek |last=Fraser |authorlink= |title=The History of Modern Leeds|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-7190-0781-1|ref={{SfnRef|Fraser|1982}}}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kirkgate Market}}\n*[http://www.leedsmarkets.co.uk/ Official Leeds City Council Markets Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032459/http://www.leeds.gov.uk/discover/discovery.asp?page=200335_414959133 Discovering Leeds - Markets]\n*[http://kirkgatemarket.wordpress.com/ Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market]\n\n{{Listed buildings in Leeds}}\n{{coord|53.7972|-1.5397|display=title|region:GB_scale:2000}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Leeds]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in West Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed markets and exchanges]]\n[[Category:Listed buildings in Leeds]]\n[[Category:Retail markets in England]]\n[[Category:Retailing in Leeds]]\n", "name_user": "Rcsprinter123", "label": "safe", "comment": "link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_Kirkgate_Market"}

MacMillan.</ref> Allbutt included an appendix of two hundred and fourteen cases of insanity he had observed with an ophthalmoscope at the asylum. He found changes in the eye in a large proportion of those diagnosed with old or organic cases of brain disease. He argued use of the ophthalmoscope would help remove 'the metaphysical or transcendental habit of thought' and bring a 'more vigorous and more philosophical mode of investigation' to disorders of the brain.<ref>Asylum Science, psychiatry, pathology, and the laboratory \u2013 from the nineteenth century to the present day: ''The Ophthalmoscope: Viewing The Living Brain''[http://asylumscience.com/2012/11/26/the-ophthalmoscope-viewing-the-living-brain/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201182139/http://asylumscience.com/2012/11/26/the-ophthalmoscope-viewing-the-living-brain/ |date=1 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHis other work included initiating and encouraging the practice of consultation between medical witnesses before the hearing of legal cases. In 1884 he gave the [[Goulstonian Lectures]] 'Chapters on visceral neuroses' at the Royal College of Physicians. In 1885 he introduced the surgical treatment of tuberculous glands in the neck. In an address at Glasgow in 1888 he urged the study of comparative medicine, proposing that information gained by observing the physiology and diseases of animals could often be applied to human medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Allbutt also made important studies of [[tetanus]] and [[Rabies|hydrophobia]].<ref name=EB1922/>\n\nThe novelist [[George Eliot]] described Allbutt as a 'good, clever and graceful man, enough to enable one to be cheerful under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds'. He is regarded generally as the model for George Eliot's Dr Lydgate in [[Middlemarch]]. Allbutt has been commemorated with a [[Leeds Civic Trust]] blue plaque.

In his monograph ''On the Use of the Ophthalmoscope in Diseases of the Nervous System and of the Kidneys'' (1871),\n<ref>Allbutt, Thomas Clifford (1871) [https://archive.org/stream/onuseophthalmos00allbgoog#page/n6/mode/2up On the use of the ophthalmoscope in diseases of the nervous system and of the kidneys]. MacMillan.</ref> Allbutt included an appendix of two hundred and fourteen cases of insanity he had observed with an ophthalmoscope at the asylum. He found changes in the eye in a large proportion of those diagnosed with old or organic cases of brain disease. He argued use of the ophthalmoscope would help remove 'the metaphysical or transcendental habit of thought' and bring a 'more vigorous and more philosophical mode of investigation' to disorders of the brain.<ref>Asylum Science, psychiatry, pathology, and the laboratory \u2013 from the nineteenth century to the present day: ''The Ophthalmoscope: Viewing The Living Brain''[http://asylumscience.com/2012/11/26/the-ophthalmoscope-viewing-the-living-brain/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201182139/http://asylumscience.com/2012/11/26/the-ophthalmoscope-viewing-the-living-brain/ |date=1 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHis other work included initiating and encouraging the practice of consultation between medical witnesses before the hearing of legal cases. In 1884 he gave the [[Goulstonian Lectures]] 'Chapters on visceral neuroses' at the Royal College of Physicians. In 1885 he introduced the surgical treatment of tuberculous glands in the neck. In an address at Glasgow in 1888 he urged the study of comparative medicine, proposing that information gained by observing the physiology and diseases of animals could often be applied to human medicine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Allbutt also made important studies of [[tetanus]] and [[Rabies|hydrophobia]].<ref name=EB1922/>\n\nThe novelist [[George Eliot]] described Allbutt as a 'good, clever and graceful man, enough to enable one to be cheerful under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds'. He is regarded generally as the model for George Eliot's Dr Lydgate in [[Middlemarch]]. Allbutt has been commemorated with a Leeds Civic Trust blue plaque. It was unveiled on his former home, now Lyddon Hall, on the Leeds University campus.<ref name=r1>[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/medicine/history/allbutt.html Sir Clifford Allbutt].

In 1892 he moved to Cambridge on becoming Regius Professor of Physic in the University of Cambridge, where he edited his ''System of Medicine'', a work which a biographer has described as 'his greatest service to contemporary medicine'. It was published in eight volumes, 1896 to 1899, with a second edition in eleven volumes, 1905 to 1911.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> For many years this was regarded as the 'doctor's bible'.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAllbutt was president of the [[British Medical Association]] in 1920 and in the same year was admitted a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1922.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: ChapterA|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nAllbutt continued as regius professor of physic at Cambridge until his death in 1925 when Sir [[Humphry Rolleston]], Physician-in-Ordinary to King George V was elected as his successor.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==History of medicine==\nIn the article ''[[s:1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Medicine|Medicine]]'' which he contributed to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] (1911), Volume 18 (pages 41 to 64), the first column began by stating that the science of medicine as then understood was concerned with the treatment of disease, and included [[pathology]], [[therapeutics]] and [[pharmacology]] which were the subject of separate articles.

It is a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] auxiliary route of [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]], running roughly through the center of the [[San Diego\u2013Tijuana metropolitan area|Greater San Diego region]] from [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] (part of the city of [[San Diego]]) near the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexico\u2013U.S. border]] to near [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]]. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes through the San Diego neighborhoods of [[North Park, San Diego|North Park]], [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]], [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], and [[University City, San Diego|University City]] before terminating at I-5 in the [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego|Sorrento Valley]] neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.\n\nPlanning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the '''Jacob Dekema Freeway''' after the longtime head of the regional division of the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the '''Mission Valley Viaduct'''. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I-5. [[High-occupancy toll]] lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-805 Northbound at CA 905.jpg|thumb|left|I-805 northbound at SR&nbsp;905]]\nThe route begins at [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] near the Mexican border in a far south part of [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]], a neighborhood of [[San Diego]].

As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets [[California State Route 15|SR&nbsp;15]], the continuation of [[Interstate 15|I-15]]. It then intersects [[El Cajon Boulevard]] before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue.<ref name=\"gmaps\" /> The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in [[Southern California]]. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] [[concrete viaduct]] built in 1972, spanning over [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]] and the [[San Diego River]].<ref name=\"Caltrans\">{{CA Named Freeways | pages=85, 212, 225}}</ref> The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over [[Interstate 8|I-8]], which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical [[stack interchange]].

It is a [[bypass (road)|bypass]] auxiliary route of [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]], running roughly through the center of the [[San Diego\u2013Tijuana metropolitan area|Greater San Diego region]] from [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]] (part of the city of [[San Diego]]) near the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexico\u2013U.S. border]] to near [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]]. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes through the San Diego neighborhoods of [[North Park, San Diego|North Park]], [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]], [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], and [[University City, San Diego|University City]] before terminating at I-5 in the [[Sorrento Valley, San Diego|Sorrento Valley]] neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.\n\nPlanning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the '''Jacob Dekema Freeway''' after the longtime head of the regional division of the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the '''Mission Valley Viaduct'''. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I-5. [[High-occupancy toll]] lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-805 Northbound at CA 905.jpg|thumb|left|I-805 northbound at SR&nbsp;905]]\nThe route begins at [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] near the Mexican border in a far south part of [[San Ysidro, San Diego|San Ysidro]], a neighborhood of [[San Diego]].

As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets [[California State Route 15|SR&nbsp;15]], the continuation of [[Interstate 15|I-15]]. It then intersects [[El Cajon Boulevard]] before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue.<ref name=\"gmaps\" /> The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in [[Southern California]]. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] [[concrete viaduct]] built in 1972, spanning over [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]] and the [[San Diego River]].<ref name=\"Caltrans\">{{CA Named Freeways | pages=85, 212, 225}}</ref> The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over [[Interstate 8|I-8]], which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical [[stack interchange]].

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

Itti Achuden's texts were written in the [[Kolezhuthu]] script that Ezhava castes used, for they were prevented from learning the more Sanskritized Aryazuthu script which was the preserve of the upper-castes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Indigenous Knowledge and the Significance of South-West India for Portuguese and Dutch Constructions of Tropical Nature |first=Richard |last=Grove |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=30 |issue=1 |date=February 1996 |pages= 121\u2013143|jstor=312903 |doi=10.1017/s0026749x00014104}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas practiced ayurvedic medicine.<ref name=\"Alan Bicker 2000 9\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FS7dkOgNGT0C&pg=PA9|title= Indigenous environmental knowledge and its transformations|page=9|first=RF Ellen Peter Parkes |last=Alan Bicker|publisher=Routledge |year=2000|accessdate=2011-06-15|isbn= 9789057024832}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XJ2HHZcM6oC&pg=PA83|title= Ecological Journeys |page=82|first=Madhav |last=Gadgil|publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2005|accessdate=2011-06-15|isbn= 9788178241128 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwNUblS-jpwC&pg=PA3120|title= Modern World System and Indian Proto-Industrialization  |page=312|first=Abhay Kumar |last=Singh|publisher=Northern book center |year=2006|accessdate=2011-06-15|isbn= 9788172112011 }}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Channaar Musicians 19th century.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Ezhava/Channar Musicians from the 19th century: Performing the traditional \"Villadichaampattu\"]]\n\n===Aivar kali===\nLiterally, Aivarkali means the play of the five sets.  This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre. The five or more performers with their leader called Kaliachan enter the performance area after a ritualistic bath, with sandalwood paste over their foreheads, dressed in white dhoti, and with a towel wrapped around their heads.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Arjuna Nrtam (Mayilppili Tukkam)===\n\n[[Mayilpeeli Thookkam|Arjuna Nrtam]] (\"the dance of [[Arjuna]]\") or Mayilppili Tukkam is a ritual art performed by men of Ezhava community and is prevalent in the [[Bhagavathy]] temples of south Kerala, mainly in [[Kollam]], Alappuzha and [[Kottayam]] districts. Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of [[snake worship]] and [[Kalarippayattu]].<ref name = \"ezh22\"/><ref name = \"ezh23\"/>\n\n===Poorakkali===\nPoorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of [[Meenam]] (March\u2013April).  Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu, a system of physical exercise formerly in vogue in Kerala.  Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Teyyam (Teyyattam) or Kaliyattam===\nIn northern Kerala, [[Theyyam|Teyyam]] is a popular [[ritual dance]]. This particular dance form is also known as Kaliyattam. The main deities of Ezhavas include Vayanattu Kulavan, Kativannur Viran, Pumarutan and [[Muthappan|Muttappan]].<ref name = \"ezh22\">{{cite book | author = Bernier, Ronald M. | title = Temple Arts of Kerala: A South Indian Tradition | publisher = Asia Book Corporation of America | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-940500-79-2 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}<ref name = \"ezh23\">{{cite book | last=Chaitanya |first=Krishna | title=Arts of India | publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=New Delhi | year=1987 | isbn=978-81-7017-209-3 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Customs==\nEzhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across [[Kerala]]. Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

These people, and other Muslim converts in the region, are now known as [[Mappilla]]s.<ref name=\"Gough313\" /> A sizeable part of the Ezhava community, especially in central [[Travancore]] and in the [[Western Ghats|High Ranges]], embraced [[Christianity]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]], due to caste-based discrimination.

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.
