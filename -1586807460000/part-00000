The album was released in November 1971, by [[Capitol Records]]. Like previous Grand Funk Railroad albums, it was recorded at [[Cleveland Recording Company]] and is the final album produced by [[Terry Knight]]. The title is a play on the motto of the United States of America, [[E pluribus unum]]. The original release cover (designed by [[Ernie Cefalu]]) was completely round and covered with a silver-like film to resemble a large coin. The back  side of the cover of this album included a die cast picture of [[Shea Stadium]] to celebrate Grand Funk beating [[The Beatles]]' Shea Stadium attendance record by selling out in just 72 hours.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Mark Farner]].\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side one\n\n| title1 = Footstompin' Music\n| length1 = 3:48\n\n| title2 = People, Let's Stop the

The album was released in November 1971, by [[Capitol Records]]. Like previous Grand Funk Railroad albums, it was recorded at [[Cleveland Recording Company]] and is the final album produced by [[Terry Knight]]. The title is a play on the motto of the United States of America, [[E pluribus unum]]. The original release cover (designed by [[Ernie Cefalu]]) was completely round and covered with a silver-like film to resemble a large coin. The back  side of the cover of this album included a die cast picture of [[Shea Stadium]] to celebrate Grand Funk beating [[The Beatles]]' Shea Stadium attendance record by selling out in just 72 hours.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Mark Farner]].\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side one\n\n| title1 = Footstompin' Music\n| length1 = 3:48\n\n| title2 = People, Let's Stop the War\n| length2 = 5:12\n\n| title3 = Upsetter\n| length3 = 4:27\n\n| title4 = I Come Tumblin'\n| length4 = 5:38\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side two\n\n| title1 = Save the Land\n| length1 = 4:14\n\n| title2 = No Lies\n| length2 = 3:57\n\n| title3 = Loneliness\n| length3 = 8:38\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Mark Farner]] \u2013 organ, guitar, harmonica, keyboards, vocals\n* [[Mel Schacher]] \u2013 bass, vocals\n* [[Don Brewer]] \u2013 percussion, drums, vocals\n* [[Terry Knight]] \u2013 producer, cover art concept\n* Kenneth Hamann \u2013 engineer\n* Craig Braun \u2013 artwork, design\n* Tom Baker \u2013 arranger and conductor on \"Loneliness\"\n\n==Charts==\n'''Album'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Chart\n!align=\"left\"|Peak Position\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1971\n|align=\"left\"|[[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]\n|align=\"left\"|5<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/grand-funk-railroad-mn0000659517/awards Grand Funk Railroad, ''E Pluribus Funk'' US Chart Position] Retrieved March 24, 2015</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Go-Set#Go-Set Australian National Charts|Australia]]\n|align=\"left\"|11<ref>[http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/ Grand Funk Railroad, ''E Pluribus Funk'' Australian Chart Position] Retrieved March 24, 2015</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[RPM (magazine)|Canada]]\n|align=\"left\"|10<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7504&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=98q6tcgku7546lsrfi3gr83pp7 Grand Funk Railroad, ''E Pluribus Funk'' Canadian Chart Position] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184405/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7504&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=98q6tcgku7546lsrfi3gr83pp7 |date=2015-04-02 }} Retrieved March 24, 2015</ref>\n|-\n|}\n'''Singles'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Single\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1971\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\"Footstompin'<br />Music\"\n|[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n|align=\"center\"|29<ref>[http://musicvf.com/song.php?title=Footstompin%27+Music+by+Grand+Funk+Railroad&id=18255 Grand Funk Railroad, \"Footstompin Music\" Chart Position] Retrieved March 24, 2015</ref>\n|-\n|Canada\n|align=\"center\"|43\n|-\n|[[Kent Music Report|Australia]]\n|align=\"center\"|83\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1971\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Upsetter\"\n|''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|73<ref>[http://musicvf.com/song.php?title=Upsetter+by+Grand+Funk+Railroad&id=18256 Grand Funk Railroad, \"Upsetter\" Chart Position] Retrieved March 24, 2015</ref>\n|-\n|Canada\n|align=\"center\"|89\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Grand Funk Railroad}}\n\n[[Category:1971 albums]]\n[[Category:Grand Funk Railroad albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Terry Knight]]\n[[Category:Capitol Records albums]]\n", "name_user": "Killersin", "label": "safe", "comment": "release date was incomplete, I completed it", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Pluribus_Funk"}

Nine groups were organized for the reserve components in 1961.<ref>Tsouras, 1994, 91.</ref> Among them were the 16th and 17th Special Forces Groups. However, [[17th Special Forces Group]], a National Guard formation with elements in Washington, was disestablished on 31 January 1966.\n\nIn the early twenty-first century, Special Forces are divided into five [[active duty]] (AD) and two [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) Special Forces groups. Each Special Forces Group (SFG) has a specific regional focus. The Special Forces soldiers assigned to these groups receive intensive language and cultural training for countries within their regional area of responsibility (AOR).<ref name=\"USASFC\">{{cite web |URL=http://www.soc.mil/SF/SF_default.htm |title=United States Army Special Forces Command}}</ref> Due to the increased need for Special Forces soldiers in the [[War on Terror]], all groups\u2014including those of the National Guard (19th and 20th SFGs)\u2014have been deployed outside of their areas of operation (AOs), particularly to [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUntil recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n<gallery>\nFile:1st Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 1st SFG(A)\nFile:3rd Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 3rd SFG(A)\nFile:5h Special Forces Group - 4 battalions.jpg|Current structure of the 5th SFG(A)\nFile:7th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 7th SFG(A)\nFile:10th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 10th SFG(A)\nFile:20th Special Operations Group - New nomenclature.JPG|Current structure of the 20th SFG(A) (ARNG)\n</gallery>\n\nA Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions. They can form 6-man \"split A\" detachments that are often used for special reconnaissance.\n{{Table of United States Army Special Forces Groups}}\n\n===Battalion Headquarters Element \u2013 SF Operational Detachment-C (SFODC) composition===\nThe SFODC, or \"C-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies. A lieutenant colonel commands the battalion as well as the C-Team, and the Battalion Command Sergeant Major is the senior NCO of the battalion and the C-Team. There is an additional 20\u201330 SF personnel who fill key positions in operations, logistics, intelligence, communications and medical. A Special Forces battalion usually consists of four companies: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and Headquarters/Support.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Company Headquarters Element \u2013 SF Operational Detachment-B (SFODB) composition===\n[[File: Special Forces commander meets with village elders Afghanistan 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A SF company commander meets with elders and members of the 209th [[Afghan National Army|ANA]] Corps in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, circa 2007]]\n[[File:Special Forces Medic in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A soldier from A Co, 1st Bn, 7th SFG(A) gives an [[Afghan]] boy a coloring book in [[Kandahar Province]] during a meeting with local leaders, circa 2008]]\nThe ODB, or \"B-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11\u201313 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field. When deployed, in line with their support role, B-Teams are usually found in more secure rear areas. However, under some circumstances a B-Team will deploy into a hostile area, usually to coordinate the activities of multiple A-Teams.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe ODB is led by an 18A, usually a major, who is the [[company commander]] (CO).

The company commander is assisted by the company sergeant major, an 18Z, usually a Sergeant Major. A second 18Z acts as the operations sergeant, usually a Master Sergeant, who assists the XO and technician in their operational duties. He has an 18F assistant operations sergeant, who is usually a Sergeant First Class. The company's support comes from an 18D medical sergeant, usually a Sergeant First Class, and two 18E communications sergeants, usually a Sergeant First Class and a Staff Sergeant.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe following jobs are outside of the Special Forces 18-series career management field (CMF), but hold positions on a Special Forces B-Team.

An ODA is identified by its group, battalion, company, and the team itself. For example, ODA 1234 would be the fourth team in the third company of the second battalion of 1st Special Forces Group.\n\nAn ODA consists of 12 soldiers, each of whom has a specific function (MOS or [[Military Occupational Specialty]]) on the team, however all members of an ODA conduct cross-training. The ODA is led by an 18A (Detachment Commander), a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], and a 180A (Assistant Detachment Commander) who is their second in command, usually a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Warrant Officer]] One or Chief Warrant Officer Two.

In the U.S. military, \"Special Forces\" is a proper (capitalized) noun referring exclusively to U.S. Army Special Forces (a.k.a. \"The Green Berets\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/29315/special-forces---shooters-and-thinkers/|title=Special Forces - Shooters and thinkers|access-date=2016-08-10}}</ref> The media and popular culture frequently misapply the term to [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] and other members of the [[United States special operations forces|U.S. Special Operations Forces]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Green_Berets_vs_Navy_SEALs|title=Green Berets vs Navy SEALs - Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Use of the term \"Operator\" ==\n[[File:Code of the Special Forces Operator.jpg|thumb|\"Code of the Special Forces Operator,\" circa 1959. This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]\nThe origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nInside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a [[Delta Force]] member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course).

The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]).

A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of Group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUntil recently an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group by 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n<gallery>\nFile:1st Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 1st SFG(A)\nFile:3rd Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 3rd SFG(A)\nFile:5h Special Forces Group - 4 battalions.jpg|Current structure of the 5th SFG(A)\nFile:7th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 7th SFG(A)\nFile:10th Special Forces Group - New 4-digit numbers ODA.JPG|Current structure of the 10th SFG(A)\nFile:20th Special Operations Group - New nomenclature.JPG|Current structure of the 20th SFG(A) (ARNG)\n</gallery>\n\nA Special Forces group is historically assigned to a [[Unified Combatant Command]] or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions. They can form 6-man \"split A\" detachments that are often used for special reconnaissance.\n{{Table of United States Army Special Forces Groups}}\n\n===Battalion Headquarters Element \u2013 SF Operational Detachment-C (SFODC) composition===\nThe SFODC, or \"C-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies. A lieutenant colonel commands the battalion as well as the C-Team, and the Battalion Command Sergeant Major is the senior NCO of the battalion and the C-Team. There is an additional 20\u201330 SF personnel who fill key positions in operations, logistics, intelligence, communications and medical. A Special Forces battalion usually consists of four companies: \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and Headquarters/Support.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Company Headquarters Element \u2013 SF Operational Detachment-B (SFODB) composition===\n[[File: Special Forces commander meets with village elders Afghanistan 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A SF company commander meets with elders and members of the 209th [[Afghan National Army|ANA]] Corps in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, circa 2007]]\n[[File:Special Forces Medic in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A soldier from A Co, 1st Bn, 7th SFG(A) gives an [[Afghan]] boy a coloring book in [[Kandahar Province]] during a meeting with local leaders, circa 2008]]\nThe ODB, or \"B-Team\", is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11\u201313 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company's A-Teams both in garrison and in the field. When deployed, in line with their support role, B-Teams are usually found in more secure rear areas. However, under some circumstances a B-Team will deploy into a hostile area, usually to coordinate the activities of multiple A-Teams.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe ODB is led by an 18A, usually a major, who is the [[company commander]] (CO).

The company commander is assisted by the company sergeant major, an 18Z, usually a Sergeant Major. A second 18Z acts as the operations sergeant, usually a Master Sergeant, who assists the XO and technician in their operational duties. He has an 18F assistant operations sergeant, who is usually a Sergeant First Class. The company's support comes from an 18D medical sergeant, usually a Sergeant First Class, and two 18E communications sergeants, usually a Sergeant First Class and a Staff Sergeant.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe following jobs are outside of the Special Forces 18-series career management field (CMF), but hold positions on a Special Forces B-Team.

An ODA is identified by its group, battalion, company, and the team itself. For example, ODA 1234 would be the fourth team in the third company of the second battalion of 1st Special Forces Group.\n\nAn ODA consists of 12 soldiers, each of whom has a specific function (MOS or [[Military Occupational Specialty]]) on the team, however all members of an ODA conduct cross-training. The ODA is led by an 18A (Detachment Commander), a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], and a 180A (Assistant Detachment Commander) who is their second in command, usually a [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Warrant Officer]] One or Chief Warrant Officer Two. The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the \"Team Sergeant\"), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants or Sergeants.

In the U.S. military, \"Special Forces\" is a proper (capitalized) noun referring exclusively to U.S. Army Special Forces (a.k.a. \"The Green Berets\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/29315/special-forces---shooters-and-thinkers/|title=Special Forces - Shooters and thinkers|access-date=2016-08-10}}</ref> The media and popular culture frequently misapply the term to [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] and other members of the [[United States special operations forces|U.S. Special Operations Forces]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Green_Berets_vs_Navy_SEALs|title=Green Berets vs Navy SEALs - Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Use of the term \"Operator\" ==\n[[File:Code of the Special Forces Operator.jpg|thumb|\"Code of the Special Forces Operator,\" circa 1959. This example pre-dates \"Delta\" among others.]]\nThe origin of the term ''operator'' in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces (referred to by many civilians as \"Green Berets\"). The Army Special Forces was established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs and 25 years before DELTA. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Marines|Marines]] was established after 1977. In ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'', Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army \"Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force (ARSOF) community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.\" He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to \"voluntary subscribe to the provisions of the ''''Code of the Special Forces Operator'''' and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.\" This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.<ref>Charles H. Briscoe. \"The Special Forces Operator 1959\". ''Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History'' (V14/N1), pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nInside the [[USSOCOM|United States Special Operations]] community, an ''operator'' is a [[Delta Force]] member who has completed selection and has graduated OTC (Operators Training Course). ''Operator'' was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit.<ref name=\"Haney\">{{cite book |last=Haney |first=Eric L. |authorlink=Eric Haney |title=[[Inside Delta Force]] |publisher=[[Delacorte Press]] |year=2002 |location=New York |page=325 |isbn=978-0-385-33603-1}}</ref>  Other [[United States special operations forces|special operations forces]] use specific names for their jobs, such as Army ''Rangers'' and Air Force ''Pararescuemen''. The Navy uses the acronym ''SEAL'' for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known ''Special Operators''. In 2006 the Navy created '''\"Special Warfare Operator\" (SO)''' as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9. (See [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|Navy special warfare ratings]]). ''Operator'' is the specific term for operational personnel, and has become a colloquial term for almost all special operations forces in the U.S. military, as well as around the world.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|United States Army Special Forces in popular culture}}\n\n; Books, movies & video games <!-- Currently in chronological order. -->\n* 1965: ''[[The Green Berets (book)|The Green Berets]]'', a book by [[Robin Moore]].<ref name=\"Moore\">{{cite book |first=Robin |last=Moore |year=2002 |title=The Green Berets |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dAmN41blzyoC}} |publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks |isbn=978-0-312-98492-2}}</ref>\n* 1965: ''Outpost of Freedom'', by [[Medal of Honor]] recipient Captain [[Roger H.

In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  \nIn 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA.

Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.\n\n''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Robotech'' (1985)====\nIn the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:\n\n#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''\n#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\n===Late 1980s to early 2000s===\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\n===2000s and beyond===\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\n==Legal problems==\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.\n\n===Mediaset conviction===\nOn November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.\n\n===Mediatrade acquittal===\n\nIn October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nProsecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million.

They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray \u2019mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I.

They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.harmonygold.com/}}\n* {{IMDb company|id=0027738}}\n\n{{Robotech}}\n{{Animated television series created for syndication}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harmony Gold Usa}}\n[[Category:Anime companies]]\n[[Category:Dubbing (filmmaking)]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Macross]]\n[[Category:Robotech]]\n[[Category:Television production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name           = Harmony Gold USA, Inc.\n| trade_name     = Harmony Gold\n| logo           = HarmonyGoldLogo.jpg\n| logo_size      = 240px\n| type           = [[Private company]]\n| foundation     = {{start date and age|1983}}\n| location       = [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], U.S.\n| key_people     = {{plainlist|\n*Frank Agrama, [[Chairman]]\n*Jehan F.

Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]].

It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Robotech'' (1985)====\nIn the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:\n\n#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''\n#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\n===Late 1980s to early 2000s===\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\n===2000s and beyond===\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\n==Legal problems==\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.\n\n===Mediaset conviction===\nOn November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time.

The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nProsecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l\u2019appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray \u2019mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I.

Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.\n\nIn November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date. While a specific number of years wasn't given for the length of this extension, Harmony Gold chairman Frank Agrama stated that the company will \"look forward to the next 35 years of working with Tatsunoko and world class business partners on ''Robotech''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Robotech/Macross License Has Been Extended (Exclusive)|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/robotech/282027/the-robotechmacross-license-has-been-extended-exclusive|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=5 July 2019|date=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Search for the Dragon Ball Harmony Gold Dub==\nThe dub was lost since it first aired in December 1989 or January 1990 on [[WWJ-TV|WGPR 62]] and [[WMYD|WXON 20]] in [[Detroit]]. It was made aware in a 2000 issue of [[Animerica]], before [[Funimation]] acquired the rights to the franchise.  The search went on for two decades after the Animerica article until a user named Tom_Servo founded an individual on the Kazenshuu forums who taped it during the television premiere. Tom_Servo eventually uploaded the tapes of the 2 films from the individual on February 21 and of the first five episodes on March 1st on the [[Internet Archive]].

They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official|http://www.harmonygold.com/}}\n* {{IMDb company|id=0027738}}\n\n{{Robotech}}\n{{Animated television series created for syndication}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harmony Gold Usa}}\n[[Category:Anime companies]]\n[[Category:Dubbing (filmmaking)]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Macross]]\n[[Category:Robotech]]\n[[Category:Television production companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSearch for the Dragon Ball Harmony Gold Dub:italicized \"Animerica\" magazine title text instances", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Gold_USA"}

''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W.

Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R.

Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    \n\n== Economic Importance ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />. However, ornate butterflyfish are nearly impossible to successfully keep in captivity because they are obligate corallivores <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n<br />\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references />\n\n# \n\n==References==\n{{Commons|Chaetodon ornatissimus}}\n* Adam, T.

Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quarters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2). Awesome Fish Spotlight: The Ornate Butterflyfish: Reef Builders: The Reef and Saltwater Aquarium Blog. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://reefbuilders.com/2017/08/02/awesome-fish-spotlight-the-ornate-butterflyfish/</nowiki></ref>. Other obligate corallivores (coral-eating) butterflyfish species include: ''[[Blacktail butterflyfish|Chaetodon austriacus]]'', ''[[Eastern triangle butterflyfish|C. baronessa]]'', [[Bluelashed butterflyfish|''C. bennetti'',]] ''[[Chaetodon larvatus|C. larvatus]]'', ''[[Oval butterflyfish|C. lunulatus]]'', [[Scrawled butterflyfish|''C. meyeri'',]] ''[[Eightband butterflyfish|C. octofasiatus]]'', ''[[Chaetodon rainfordi|C. rainfordi]],'' and ''[[Melon butterflyfish|C. trifasicatus]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-profile-butterflyfish-family-chaetodontidae-2920779|title=What to Feed Your Butterflyfish|website=The Spruce Pets|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>''.'' Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells; therefore, butterflyfish need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral, and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.    \n\n== Economic Importance ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are one of the most popular tropical fishes with divers and aquarists <ref name=\":7\" />. However, ornate butterflyfish are nearly impossible to successfully keep in captivity because they are obligate corallivores <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n<br />\n\n==Footnotes==\n<references />\n\n# \n\n==References==\n{{Commons|Chaetodon ornatissimus}}\n* Adam, T.
