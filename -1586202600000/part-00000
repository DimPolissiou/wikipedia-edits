However, this artificial ornamentation by scion of [[Ahom dynasty|Ahom]] Royal House was short lived, and in the year 1838 AD, the whole area was resumed by the authorities of the company and annexed to the British territory with the appointment of Col. ''Aham White'' as the political agent on 16 September during the same year.\n\nBy a proclamation in 1839, the British took possession of Assam, and the area was divided into two districts of [[Lakhimpur, Assam|Lakhimpur]] and [[Sivasagar|Sibsagar]], where the ''Doyang \u2013 Dhansiri'' valley was included under the newly formed Golaghat subdivision of ''Sibsagar'' district in 1839.

They released several albums throughout the 1980s and are best known for their hit single, 1984's \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\"\n\n==History==\n===Formation and classic years (1983\u20131988)===\nAutograph originally began in late 1983 as a solo project for singer, songwriter and guitarist Steve Plunkett, who had recently left the band [[Silver Condor (band)|Silver Condor]]. Plunkett was playing and recording his own material with a group of his musician friends, most of whom had previously played with him in other bands:\n\nOn lead guitar was [[Steve Lynch]], who had played with Plunkett in the band Looker.\n\nOn Bass was Randy Rand who knew Plunkett from their days in [[Pasadena, California]]'s club band Wolfgang, that has been described as a local legend of which [[Kevin Dubrow]] (lead singer of [[Quiet Riot]]) once said, \"They smoked us all... they got a better response than us and Van Halen\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Konow, David|title=Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]|date=2002|page=90|isbn= 978-0609807323}}</ref>\n\nOn keyboards, Steven Isham (born Steven E. Isham on November 30, 1952 in [[Pocatello, Idaho]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/idahostatejournal/obituary.aspx?pid=121265596|title=Steve Isham Obituary|website=Legacy.com}}</ref> who had also played with mutual acquaintance Holly Penfield, was brought in to give the band a more modern sound.\n\nOn drums was earlier bandmate, Keni Richards, that Plunkett knew from John Doe, rounding out the band's lineup with Richards' friendship of Van Halen lead singer, [[David Lee Roth]] being instrumental in leading to Autograph's big break the following year.\n\nThe group of musicians began playing and recording together, soon taking the form of an actual band.  Plunkett chose the name \"Autograph\" for the band, having been inspired by hearing [[Def Leppard]]'s similarly titled song, [[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|''Photograph'']], on the radio. They recorded their first rough demos in late 1983, but played them only for a few close friends. One of them was [[Andy Johns]], a famous record producer who Steve Plunkett had met while helping singer [[Joe Cerisano]] produce Silver Condor's second album ''Trouble At Home''. Johns invited the band to re-record and upgrade the demos at the world-famous [[Record Plant]] Studios for free under his guidance. Keni Richards then played the demo for Roth, who subsequently invited the band to open for Van Halen on their ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' tour. The band rose to prominence opening for Van Halen, ultimately playing 48 shows, an act of distinction for an unsigned band. Due to their rising popularity, Autograph soon signed a contract with [[RCA Records]] following a performance at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in late 1984.\n\nAutograph's debut album, ''[[Sign In Please]]'', was completed and released in October, but did not make an appearance on any record charts until January 1985. The album contains the band's only major hit, and now signature song, \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\" The song itself was one of the last ones recorded for the album, and the band members were initially very lukewarm toward it. However, the tune would become a top-30 hit, pushing album sales past the [[gold album]] mark (500,000 copies sold). The song was featured in an episode of \"[[Miami Vice]]\" (entitled \"Little Prince\") and was also leased out to numerous other films, even further elevating the song's popularity. Lynch's guitar work in \"Turn Up The Radio\", featuring a distinctive two-handed, fretboard-tapping technique, won him the \"Guitar Solo of the Year\" award from [[Guitar Player]] magazine in 1985.\n\n\"Send Her to Me\" was released as a follow-up single, though its success paled in comparison to the massive first hit.  Other songs from the ''Sign in Please'' album, \"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend Isn't Me\" and \"Deep End,\" along with \"Take No Prisoners,\" which would soon appear on the band's follow-up album, and were featured in the 1985 film ''[[Secret Admirer]],'' starring [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Corey Haim]], [[Lori Loughlin]] and [[Casey Siemaszko]]. The 1985 film ''[[Fright Night]]'' also included a song the band recorded titled \"You Can't Hide From the Beast Inside\".\n\nA second album, ''[[That's the Stuff]]'', was quickly recorded and released in the fall of 1985, and the group went on tour in support of several other bands, including [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Heart (band)|Heart]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Although record sales were disappointing in comparison to their first album, it still achieved near gold status. Supported by the single, \"Blondes in Black Cars\" and the title track, a minor-hit, it eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;92 on the Billboard album charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=autograph|chart=Billboard 200}} Autograph- album chart positions @Billboard.com] Retrieved 1-1-2012.</ref>  The band then recorded a song titled \"Winning Is Everything\" for the film ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]''.\n\nAutograph recorded a third album, which took longer to record than the other two combined and ''[[Loud and Clear (Autograph album)|Loud and Clear]]'' was released in the spring of 1987. The title song's music video featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Vince Neil]] of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] as extras. The band also made three appearances on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' in support of the album. In October, the band made a cameo in the film ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father, Like Son]]'', starring [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Kirk Cameron]]. The first song featured was \"Dance all Night,\" which played briefly, and then they performed the song \"She Never Looked That Good for Me\" for the film, appearing in a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as themselves. Despite all three of these songs being released as singles, the album was not a big success, mostly due to lackluster support from the label.\n\n===Leaving RCA and break up (1988\u20131989)===\nThe band left RCA Records in early 1988. Isham left the band to pursue other options but was not replaced, as the band felt they no longer needed keyboards and wanted to take a newer and heavier direction. The remaining members began recording a new album in 1988 which they hoped to release sometime the following year, but those plans never occurred due to lack of any type of label support.\n\nRichards also left the band around this time. However, in early 1989 the band toured with new drummer Eddie Cross and continued to sporadically record. The band would eventually be offered a new deal with [[Epic Records|Epic]] in 1989, which they declined.\n\nIn their short time they recorded three albums and toured with several famous bands, including [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Van Halen]], [[Bryan Adams]], and [[Whitesnake]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050205/http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|url-status=dead|title=Steve Lynch's Official Website|archivedate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> but in the end could not sustain their own career.\n\nDisappointed, the remaining members disbanded in December 1989.\n\n===Post break-up (1989\u20132013)===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2014}}\nThough the group had disbanded, a few of their music videos (most commonly \"Turn Up the Radio\") continued to be played on music video channels and programs such as [[MTV]]'s [[Headbangers Ball]] for several years after their initial debut. \n\n'''Steve Plunkett''' \u2013 When the original group disbanded in 1989, Plunkett became a staff writer and producer for All Nations Music, where he had over 170 of his songs released, including over 40 in movies like ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'', \"Brave New Girl\" (Britney Spears penned movie for ABC Family) and ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]''. Many artists have recorded his songs including [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]], [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Edgar Winter]].  He has also produced artists such as [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Graham Nash]] and [[En Vogue]].  He wrote and performed the theme song for the WB television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', as well as several other theme songs for shows such as ''[[Summerland (TV series)|Summerland]]'', ''Kojak'', and ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' which featured \"Behind the Mask\" performed by [[Jose Feliciano]]. Plunkett has had his original songs in hundreds of TV shows such as ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]].''\n\n'''Steve Lynch''' \u2013 The original lead guitarist has been a guitar teacher for several years, schooling students in his virtuosic signature 8-finger \"hammer-on\" guitar technique. He has also published several books on his guitar styles as well as an instructional video that has been a top seller worldwide. He has conducted 325 'guitar clinics' in 18 countries. He eventually formed another band named Network 23 and the album by the same name was released in 2004. He currently owns a music school in the Seattle area and completed a new teaching website called lynchlicks.com that went online in 2009.\n\n'''Randy Rand''' \u2013 The former bassist began a career in leather-making, establishing an international importing/exporting shop that sells his own hand-crafted leather products,  and even working with [[Harley Davidson]] for a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pp.auto.ke.orange.fr/|title=Orange|website=Pp.auto.ke.orange.fr}}</ref> According to Autograph's now-defunct \"Turn Up the Web!\" website, he has a daughter named Sterling Knight who has become a relatively well-known model in Italy.\n\n'''Keni Richards''' \u2013 The drummer went on to work with the band [[Dirty White Boy (band)|Dirty White Boy]], but later left the music business due to a chronic back problem he has had for several years. Nevertheless, he continued his passion for music and art, publicly saying he has no regrets. He also involved himself in songwriting and producing duties even after the band broke up and continued it even after band's reformation, wherein he participated for a short period of time. Richards died on April 8, 2017, reportedly in a drug-related homicide.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://sleazeroxx.com/ex-autograph-drummer-keni-richards-murdered-homicide-investigation-pending/|title=Ex-Autograph drummer Keni Richards murdered \u2014 homicide investigation pending |website=Sleazeroxx.com|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Steven Isham''' \u2013 The keyboardist joined up with [[Gary Moon]], who later replaced [[Jack Blades]] in the band [[Night Ranger]], to form The Pack, and he later went on to tour as the drummer for [[Vince Neil]]'s solo act. Remaining active in the music business throughout the ensuing years, Isham died on December 9, 2008, at the age of 56 from [[liver cancer]].\n\n'''Eddie Cross''' \u2013 The drummer of the Los Angeles band, Hot Wheelz, joined Autograph and played on its 1989 tour and the new tracks on the ''Missing Pieces'' CD.  He was later a member several other L.A. bands, including Bad Boys (with former members of [[Quiet Riot]]), Vigilante Man (with [[Guns N' Roses]] co-writer West Arkeen) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (who later joined Guns N' Roses).  In 1991, Cross went to law school in [[Orange County, California]], and has been President of Law Offices of Edward H. Cross & Associates, PC since 1995.  The firm opened in Santa Ana, California, relocated to Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i in 2004 and finally landed in Palm Desert, California, in 2005, where he practices construction and real estate law.  He has a daughter and a son and is a world traveler and an avid photographer.\n\n===Reunion (2013\u2013present)===\nIn late 2013, original members Steve Lynch, Randy Rand, and Keni Richards got back together for a reunion. Due to Plunkett not being interested in doing the reunion, they have replaced him with Jailhouse, Flood, 1RKO, solo artist singer/songwriter/guitarist Simon Daniels. The band has an interview in [[Guitar World]] Magazine, a review in Classic Rock and Fireworks magazines.\n\nSince 2014, by which time Richards had been replaced by Mark Wieland on drums, the band has played the Monsters of Rock Cruise, M3 Rock Festival, The Moondance Jam, The Halfway Jam, Firefest UK, Rockin the Rivers, The Iowa State Fair along with other festivals, theaters and worldwide touring.\n\nOn January 15, 2015, they released their first single, \"You Are Us, We Are You,\" on [[iTunes]]. On April 21, they released their 2nd single, \"I Lost My Mind in America,\" which made the Top 10 download of the charts. In July, the band was featured in [[USA Today NEWS]] after playing the famous Halfway Jam Rock Festival. On September 23, the band released their 3rd single \"Every Generation\" and is featured as track of the week on [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] Magazine.\n\nOn January 7, 2016, the new 5 song EP ''Louder'', with 4 original new singles and a live version of \"Turn up the Radio\", was released and is available on the official website.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, the band completed the recordings for the new full album which will be announced and released this year In March, the band had already toured the Midwest and Northeast US again, with shows in the UK and Germany and is booked solid for the rest of the year.\n\nOn April 8, 2017, Keni Richards died at the age of 60. The cause of his death appears to be a drug-related homicide.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn July 29, 2017, the band signed with [[EMP Label Group]] owned by David Ellefson of Megadeth and have announced a new album titled ''Get Off Your Ass'', which was released on October 6, with a limited-edition vinyl LP. The Album hit # 21 on the Billboard Classic Rock Sales Chart with 2 singles on the Top 10 on the Hard Rock Media base Radio Chart. Extensive Touring followed the release. The Album got amazing reviews Worldwide. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/autograph-to-release-get-off-your-ass-album-in-october/|title=AUTOGRAPH |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 24, 2019, Steve Lynch decided to move on to other projects so the band added a new guitarist on August 27, 2019. Jimi Bell previously played in the House of Lords and Maxx Explosion. Bell appeared in the 1986 film, ''Light Of Day'', where he was both a performer in the movie and played on the soundtrack album.

Plunkett was playing and recording his own material with a group of his musician friends, most of whom had previously played with him in other bands:\n\nOn lead guitar was [[Steve Lynch]], who had played with Plunkett in the band Looker.\n\nOn Bass was Randy Rand who knew Plunkett from their days in [[Pasadena, California]]'s club band Wolfgang, that has been described as a local legend of which [[Kevin Dubrow]] (lead singer of [[Quiet Riot]]) once said, \"They smoked us all... they got a better response than us and Van Halen\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Konow, David|title=Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]|date=2002|page=90|isbn= 978-0609807323}}</ref>\n\nOn keyboards, Steven Isham (born Steven E. Isham on November 30, 1952 in [[Pocatello, Idaho]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/idahostatejournal/obituary.aspx?pid=121265596|title=Steve Isham Obituary|website=Legacy.com}}</ref> who had also played with mutual acquaintance Holly Penfield, was brought in to give the band a more modern sound.\n\nOn drums was earlier bandmate, Keni Richards, that Plunkett knew from John Doe, rounding out the band's lineup with Richards' friendship of Van Halen lead singer, [[David Lee Roth]] being instrumental in leading to Autograph's big break the following year.\n\nThe group of musicians began playing and recording together, soon taking the form of an actual band.  Plunkett chose the name \"Autograph\" for the band, having been inspired by hearing [[Def Leppard]]'s similarly titled song, [[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|''Photograph'']], on the radio. They recorded their first rough demos in late 1983, but played them only for a few close friends. One of them was [[Andy Johns]], a famous record producer who Steve Plunkett had met while helping singer [[Joe Cerisano]] produce Silver Condor's second album ''Trouble At Home''. Johns invited the band to re-record and upgrade the demos at the world-famous [[Record Plant]] Studios for free under his guidance. Keni Richards then played the demo for Roth, who subsequently invited the band to open for Van Halen on their ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' tour. The band rose to prominence opening for Van Halen, ultimately playing 48 shows, an act of distinction for an unsigned band. Due to their rising popularity, Autograph soon signed a contract with [[RCA Records]] following a performance at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] in late 1984.\n\nAutograph's debut album, ''[[Sign In Please]]'', was completed and released in October, but did not make an appearance on any record charts until January 1985. The album contains the band's only major hit, and now signature song, \"[[Turn Up the Radio (Autograph song)|Turn Up the Radio]].\" The song itself was one of the last ones recorded for the album, and the band members were initially very lukewarm toward it. However, the tune would become a top-30 hit, pushing album sales past the [[gold album]] mark (500,000 copies sold). The song was featured in an episode of \"[[Miami Vice]]\" (entitled \"Little Prince\") and was also leased out to numerous other films, even further elevating the song's popularity. Lynch's guitar work in \"Turn Up The Radio\", featuring a distinctive two-handed, fretboard-tapping technique, won him the \"Guitar Solo of the Year\" award from [[Guitar Player]] magazine in 1985.\n\n\"Send Her to Me\" was released as a follow-up single, though its success paled in comparison to the massive first hit.  Other songs from the ''Sign in Please'' album, \"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend Isn't Me\" and \"Deep End,\" along with \"Take No Prisoners,\" which would soon appear on the band's follow-up album, and were featured in the 1985 film ''[[Secret Admirer]],'' starring [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Corey Haim]], [[Lori Loughlin]] and [[Casey Siemaszko]]. The 1985 film ''[[Fright Night]]'' also included a song the band recorded titled \"You Can't Hide From the Beast Inside\".\n\nA second album, ''[[That's the Stuff]]'', was quickly recorded and released in the fall of 1985, and the group went on tour in support of several other bands, including [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] and [[Heart (band)|Heart]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Although record sales were disappointing in comparison to their first album, it still achieved near gold status. Supported by the single, \"Blondes in Black Cars\" and the title track, a minor-hit, it eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;92 on the Billboard album charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=autograph|chart=Billboard 200}} Autograph- album chart positions @Billboard.com] Retrieved 1-1-2012.</ref>  The band then recorded a song titled \"Winning Is Everything\" for the film ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]''.\n\nAutograph recorded a third album, which took longer to record than the other two combined and ''[[Loud and Clear (Autograph album)|Loud and Clear]]'' was released in the spring of 1987. The title song's music video featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Vince Neil]] of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] as extras. The band also made three appearances on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' in support of the album. In October, the band made a cameo in the film ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father, Like Son]]'', starring [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Kirk Cameron]]. The first song featured was \"Dance all Night,\" which played briefly, and then they performed the song \"She Never Looked That Good for Me\" for the film, appearing in a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as themselves. Despite all three of these songs being released as singles, the album was not a big success, mostly due to lackluster support from the label.\n\n===Leaving RCA and break up (1988\u20131989)===\nThe band left RCA Records in early 1988. Isham left the band to pursue other options but was not replaced, as the band felt they no longer needed keyboards and wanted to take a newer and heavier direction. The remaining members began recording a new album in 1988 which they hoped to release sometime the following year, but those plans never occurred due to lack of any type of label support.\n\nRichards also left the band around this time. However, in early 1989 the band toured with new drummer Eddie Cross and continued to sporadically record. The band would eventually be offered a new deal with [[Epic Records|Epic]] in 1989, which they declined.\n\nIn their short time they recorded three albums and toured with several famous bands, including [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Ronnie James Dio]], [[Van Halen]], [[Bryan Adams]], and [[Whitesnake]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050205/http://www.stevelynch.info/auto.asp?Sec=about&Val=0|url-status=dead|title=Steve Lynch's Official Website|archivedate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> but in the end could not sustain their own career.\n\nDisappointed, the remaining members disbanded in December 1989.\n\n===Post break-up (1989\u20132013)===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2014}}\nThough the group had disbanded, a few of their music videos (most commonly \"Turn Up the Radio\") continued to be played on music video channels and programs such as [[MTV]]'s [[Headbangers Ball]] for several years after their initial debut. \n\n'''Steve Plunkett''' \u2013 When the original group disbanded in 1989, Plunkett became a staff writer and producer for All Nations Music, where he had over 170 of his songs released, including over 40 in movies like ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'', \"Brave New Girl\" (Britney Spears penned movie for ABC Family) and ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]''. Many artists have recorded his songs including [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]], [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Edgar Winter]].  He has also produced artists such as [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Graham Nash]] and [[En Vogue]].  He wrote and performed the theme song for the WB television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', as well as several other theme songs for shows such as ''[[Summerland (TV series)|Summerland]]'', ''Kojak'', and ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' which featured \"Behind the Mask\" performed by [[Jose Feliciano]]. Plunkett has had his original songs in hundreds of TV shows such as ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]].''\n\n'''Steve Lynch''' \u2013 The original lead guitarist has been a guitar teacher for several years, schooling students in his virtuosic signature 8-finger \"hammer-on\" guitar technique. He has also published several books on his guitar styles as well as an instructional video that has been a top seller worldwide. He has conducted 325 'guitar clinics' in 18 countries. He eventually formed another band named Network 23 and the album by the same name was released in 2004. He currently owns a music school in the Seattle area and completed a new teaching website called lynchlicks.com that went online in 2009.\n\n'''Randy Rand''' \u2013 The former bassist began a career in leather-making, establishing an international importing/exporting shop that sells his own hand-crafted leather products,  and even working with [[Harley Davidson]] for a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pp.auto.ke.orange.fr/|title=Orange|website=Pp.auto.ke.orange.fr}}</ref> According to Autograph's now-defunct \"Turn Up the Web!\" website, he has a daughter named Sterling Knight who has become a relatively well-known model in Italy.\n\n'''Keni Richards''' \u2013 The drummer went on to work with the band [[Dirty White Boy (band)|Dirty White Boy]], but later left the music business due to a chronic back problem he has had for several years. Nevertheless, he continued his passion for music and art, publicly saying he has no regrets. He also involved himself in songwriting and producing duties even after the band broke up and continued it even after band's reformation, wherein he participated for a short period of time. Richards died on April 8, 2017, reportedly in a drug-related homicide.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://sleazeroxx.com/ex-autograph-drummer-keni-richards-murdered-homicide-investigation-pending/|title=Ex-Autograph drummer Keni Richards murdered \u2014 homicide investigation pending |website=Sleazeroxx.com|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Steven Isham''' \u2013 The keyboardist joined up with [[Gary Moon]], who later replaced [[Jack Blades]] in the band [[Night Ranger]], to form The Pack, and he later went on to tour as the drummer for [[Vince Neil]]'s solo act. Remaining active in the music business throughout the ensuing years, Isham died on December 9, 2008, at the age of 56 from [[liver cancer]].\n\n'''Eddie Cross''' \u2013 The drummer of the Los Angeles band, Hot Wheelz, joined Autograph and played on its 1989 tour and the new tracks on the ''Missing Pieces'' CD.  He was later a member several other L.A. bands, including Bad Boys (with former members of [[Quiet Riot]]), Vigilante Man (with [[Guns N' Roses]] co-writer West Arkeen) and [[Gilby Clarke]] (who later joined Guns N' Roses).  In 1991, Cross went to law school in [[Orange County, California]], and has been President of Law Offices of Edward H. Cross & Associates, PC since 1995.  The firm opened in Santa Ana, California, relocated to Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i in 2004 and finally landed in Palm Desert, California, in 2005, where he practices construction and real estate law.  He has a daughter and a son and is a world traveler and an avid photographer.\n\n===Reunion (2013\u2013present)===\nIn late 2013, original members Steve Lynch, Randy Rand, and Keni Richards got back together for a reunion. Due to Plunkett not being interested in doing the reunion, they have replaced him with Jailhouse, Flood, 1RKO, solo artist singer/songwriter/guitarist Simon Daniels. The band has an interview in [[Guitar World]] Magazine, a review in Classic Rock and Fireworks magazines.\n\nSince 2014, by which time Richards had been replaced by Mark Wieland on drums, the band has played the Monsters of Rock Cruise, M3 Rock Festival, The Moondance Jam, The Halfway Jam, Firefest UK, Rockin the Rivers, The Iowa State Fair along with other festivals, theaters and worldwide touring.\n\nOn January 15, 2015, they released their first single, \"You Are Us, We Are You,\" on [[iTunes]].

Thomas Corrigan owned a retail grocery and liquor business in Newark, and the family's well-to-do status allowed Michael to pursue his educational interests. He attended [[St. Mary's College (Delaware)|St. Mary's College]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], from 1853\u20131855, [[Mount Saint Mary's University]] in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]] from 1855\u20131857, spent a year in Europe, and received his bachelor's degree from Mount Saint Mary's in 1859. He became a member of the first class at the [[Pontifical North American College|North American College]] in Rome, was ordained to the priesthood in September 1863 at the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|Basilica of St. John Lateran]], and received a doctorate of divinity in 1864.<ref name=Mooney>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04395a.htm Mooney, Joseph. \"Michael Augustine Corrigan.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 October 2015</ref>\n\nCorrigan returned to New Jersey in 1864, where he joined the faculty at [[Seton Hall College]] and the Immaculate Conception Seminary, both in [[South Orange]], as professor of theology and history. He soon achieved a reputation within the hierarchy for sound scholarship, and he also provided pastoral care to Catholics in the Seton Hall vicinity. When [[Bernard J. McQuaid]] left Seton Hall in 1869 to assume his duties as bishop of the [[Diocese of Rochester]], Corrigan succeeded him as college president and also became vicar general of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark|Diocese of Newark]].<ref name=Mooney/>\n\n==Bishop of Newark==\n[[Image:Michael Corrigan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Michael Corrigan]]\nCorrigan succeeded [[James Roosevelt Bayley]] as bishop of Newark, becoming the second ordinary of the diocese. He was consecrated bishop on May 4, 1873.<ref name=Mooney/> The diocese encompassed the entire state of [[New Jersey]] during Corrigan's tenure. He administered diocesan affairs during a time of rapid population growth, Roman Catholic institutional development, immigration from Ireland and Germany, and considerable urbanization in the northern part of the state.\n\n==Archbishop of New York==\nCorrigan was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop to [[John McCloskey|John Cardinal McCloskey]] of New York on October 1, 1880,<ref name=Grace>[https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Article/TabId/535/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/4845/John-Ireland-and-Michael-A-Corrigan.aspx Grace CVI, Madeline. \"John Ireland and Michael A. Corrigan\", ''OSV Newsweekly'', August 28, 2009]</ref> with the [[titular see]] of Petra, and succeeded to the archbishopric on October 10, 1885, serving as archbishop until his death.\n\nCorrigan's career in New York proved controversial on a number of levels. He aligned himself closely with his former mentor, [[Bernard J. McQuaid]] and has been considered one of the leaders of the \"conservative\" movement within the American Catholic hierarchy. He proved to be a strong supporter of [[national parish]]es<ref name=Grace/> and [[Catholic school|parochial schools]], a vocal opponent of [[John Ireland (archbishop)|John Ireland]], [[James Gibbons]] and other bishops who advocated \"[[Americanism (heresy)#Suppression of Americanism|Americanization]]\" within the Catholic Church.  Within the American hierarchy, he was the closest supporter of Pope Leo XIII on ''[[Testem benevolentiae nostrae]]''. He also proved unpopular with many bishops for his involvement in backstage intrigue at the Vatican.\n\nWithin the [[Archdiocese of New York]] his most serious controversy involved his conflict with Father [[Edward McGlynn]].  During the 1886 mayoral campaign in [[New York City]], the outspoken McGlynn supported [[Henry George]], the candidate of the [[Central Labor Union|United Labor Party]] who proved popular with labor organizers, radicals, socialists, and Irish nationalists. Corrigan himself had been very close to [[Tammany Hall]] and ordered McGlynn to refrain from politics. McGlynn refused, continued to clash with the bishop, and ultimately was removed as pastor of St. Stephen's Church in New York. McGlynn was summoned to Rome but refused on the grounds of ill health and was excommunicated in 1887. The censure was eventually lifted in 1892. This highly public scandal took its toll on Corrigan and contributed to his poor relationships with an influential group of New York intellectual priests. His greatest accomplishment probably involved the building of a new seminary, [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie]].\n\nIn 1897, [[Edgardo Mortara]] preached in St. Patrick's Cathedral [[New York City]], but the Archbishop of New York told the Holy See that he opposed Mortara's efforts to evangelize the Jews on the grounds that such efforts might embarrass the Church in the view of the [[United States]] government.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} He also had invited [[Mother Cabrini]] to New York, but had to withdraw his invitation. By then Mother Cabrini and her missionaries had already embarked on their sea voyage to New York.\n\nCorrigan slipped and fell when inspecting the excavation of the seminary in 1902. He contracted pneumonia during his convalescence and died. He was interred in the crypt under the altar of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]].\n\n{{Ordination\n| ordained deacon by   =\n| date of diaconal ordination =\n| place of diaconal ordination =\n| ordained priest by   = \n| date of priestly ordination = 19 September 1863\n| place of priestly ordination =\n| consecrated by       = [[John McCloskey]]\n| co-consecrators      = [[John Loughlin (bishop)|John Loughlin]]\n[[William George McCloskey]] \n| date of consecration = 4 May 1873\n| place of consecration =\n| elevated by          =\n| date of elevation    =\n\n| bishop 1             = [[Winand Michael Wigger]]\n| consecration date 1  = 1881\n| bishop 2             = [[Patrick Anthony Ludden]]\n| consecration date 2  = 1887\n| bishop 3             = [[Charles Edward McDonnell]]\n| consecration date 3  = 1892\n| bishop 4             = [[Henry Gabriels]]\n| consecration date 4  = 1892\n| bishop 5             = [[Thomas Martin Aloysius Burke]]\n| consecration date 5  = 1894\n| bishop 6             = [[James Augustine McFaul]]\n| consecration date 6  = 1894\n| bishop 7             = [[John Murphy Farley]]\n| consecration date 7  = 1895\n| bishop 8             = [[James Edward Quigley]]\n| consecration date 8  = 1897\n| bishop 9             = [[John J.

Corrigan himself had been very close to [[Tammany Hall]] and ordered McGlynn to refrain from politics. McGlynn refused, continued to clash with the bishop, and ultimately was removed as pastor of St. Stephen's Church in New York. McGlynn was summoned to Rome but refused on the grounds of ill health and was excommunicated in 1887. The censure was eventually lifted in 1892. This highly public scandal took its toll on Corrigan and contributed to his poor relationships with an influential group of New York intellectual priests. His greatest accomplishment probably involved the building of a new seminary, [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie]].\n\nIn 1897, [[Edgardo Mortara]] preached in St. Patrick's Cathedral [[New York City]], but the Archbishop of New York told the Holy See that he opposed Mortara's efforts to evangelize the Jews on the grounds that such efforts might embarrass the Church in the view of the [[United States]] government.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} He also had invited [[Mother Cabrini]] to New York, but had to withdraw his invitation. By then Mother Cabrini and her missionaries had already embarked on their sea voyage to New York.\n\nCorrigan slipped and fell when inspecting the excavation of the seminary in 1902. He contracted pneumonia during his convalescence and died. He was interred in the crypt under the altar of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]].\n\n{{Ordination\n| ordained deacon by   =\n| date of diaconal ordination =\n| place of diaconal ordination =\n| ordained priest by   = \n| date of priestly ordination = 19 September 1863\n| place of priestly ordination =\n| consecrated by       = [[John McCloskey]]\n| co-consecrators      = [[John Loughlin (bishop)|John Loughlin]]\n[[William George McCloskey]] \n| date of consecration = 4 May 1873\n| place of consecration =\n| elevated by          =\n| date of elevation    =\n\n| bishop 1             = [[Winand Michael Wigger]]\n| consecration date 1  = 1881\n| bishop 2             = [[Patrick Anthony Ludden]]\n| consecration date 2  = 1887\n| bishop 3             = [[Charles Edward McDonnell]]\n| consecration date 3  = 1892\n| bishop 4             = [[Henry Gabriels]]\n| consecration date 4  = 1892\n| bishop 5             = [[Thomas Martin Aloysius Burke]]\n| consecration date 5  = 1894\n| bishop 6             = [[James Augustine McFaul]]\n| consecration date 6  = 1894\n| bishop 7             = [[John Murphy Farley]]\n| consecration date 7  = 1895\n| bishop 8             = [[James Edward Quigley]]\n| consecration date 8  = 1897\n| bishop 9             = [[John J.

Vischer said that he wasn't interested in being part of the new reboot unless he had a role in shaping the creative and educational content for the show. As a result, NBCUniversal and TBN allowed him to view an early draft of the pilot. Vischer was encouraged by the fact that the early draft of the pilot reflected the heart of the classic episodes from the original series, instead of VeggieTales in the House and VeggieTales in the City.<ref name=\"religionnews.com\"/> [[NBCUniversal]] and TBN then allowed Vischer to rewrite the pilot.<ref name=\"themovieproposal.libsyn.com\"/> Before long, he and Nawrocki signed on as head-writers, executive producers, and voice actors for the reboot.<ref name=\"religionnews.com\"/>\n\nAlthough ''[[VeggieTales in the House]]'' was critically successful and was nominated for several [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], fans of the original series were disappointed by the entire \"Netflix series\", and a majority of the fans were disgusted and unsatisfied with the redesigns of the characters.<ref name=\"philvischer.com\"/> On [[social media]], fans complained that their favorite characters were given completely different personalities, the theological teachings were shallow, and the series as a whole was too babyish compared to the original series. With this being said, the viewership of VeggieTales in the House on Netflix was significantly lower than the viewership of the original series. As a result, Vischer and Nawrocki made The VeggieTales Show feel much like the original series as possible. They brought back the original character designs. They brought back many members of the creative team from the original series including Big Idea Entertainment's original music director, [[Kurt Heinecke|Kurt Heniecke]], and lead storyboard artists/director, [[Tod Carter]].<ref>{{Citation|title=VeggieTales is Back: Brand New VeggieTales Show Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6RF9XIGyhg|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref> Lisa Vischer, the original voice of Junior Asparagus, also returned from a five-year hiatus to reprise the role.<ref name=\"themovieproposal.libsyn.com\"/>\n\nAfter a few years away from VeggieTales, Vischer revealed some of his regrets of the original series.

With this being said, the viewership of VeggieTales in the House on Netflix was significantly lower than the viewership of the original series. As a result, Vischer and Nawrocki made The VeggieTales Show feel much like the original series as possible. They brought back the original character designs.

In this way, ten of the most influential (in the opinion of the MFA) English language global medias were covered: [[Reuters]], [[CNN]], [[BBC News]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Daily Mail]], [[The Washington Post]], [[The New York Times]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Euronews]]. Some of Ukrainian top officials participated in this act: apart from then Minister of foreign affairs [[Pavlo Klimkin]], there also participated the action Minister of healthcare [[Ulana Suprun]], Representative of Ukraine at the Council of Europe [[Dmytro Kuleba]] and the member of parliament [[Yehor Soboliev]]. The campaign saw support of several thousands of Ukrainians, and the hashtag \"#KyivNotKiev\" have been seen by some 10 million social network users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/29557242.html|title=\u0427\u0438 \u0437\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0441\u044f Kiev \u043d\u0430 Kyiv? \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0457, \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0456\u0430|trans-title=Did it change from Kiev to Kyiv?

Definite article is rarely used before the names of independent states, but is often used before names of regions of countries. This norm established during the Soviet times, when Ukraine was not an independent state yet, and continuing to use a definite article before country's name is seen by many Ukrainians as questioning Ukrainian sovereignty.

Previously, most airports refused to do so, saying that in lists of the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) and [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) the name \"Kiev\" was specified. However, in October 2019 IATA, following the decision of U.S. Board on Geographic Names, switched to \"Kyiv\".\n\nSince the moment of campaigns launch, 63 airports and 3 airlines worldwide (as of January 2020) began using the name \"Kyiv\", even before this new name was adopted by IATA. Among them are [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto Pearson]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]], [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]], [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] and [[Josep Tarradellas Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport|Josep Tarradellas Barcelona\u2013El Prat]].<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n\n== Name of Kiev in [[English Wikipedia]] ==\n[[File:Kyiv_City_State_Administration_Letter_to_WMF.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Letter from [[Kiev City State Administration]] to [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\nA fierce fight about the name of Ukrainian capital is taking place in [[English Wikipedia]], where two opposing camps defend their versions of the city name: one side tries to rename the article from \"Kiev\" to \"Kyiv\", the other opposes it. Starting from 2007, there were [[Talk:Kiev|12 discussion on proposed page rename]], none of them resulting in the article title being changed. Because of supporters of the name \"Kyiv\" starting new rename requests without having any new arguments since the last time, a rename moratorium was imposed, expiring July 1, 2020.\n\nThe only known attempt by Ukrainian government to influence Wikipedia was a letter from [[Kiev City State Administration]] to [[Wikimedia Foundation]] (organization running Wikipedia) with a request to correct \"Kiev\" into \"Kyiv\".\n\n== Name of Kiev in [[German language]] ==\nThe problem of the name of Ukrainian capital being transliterated from Russian variant instead of Ukrainian is present not only in English, but also in majority of European languages, e.g. in [[German language]], where variant \"Kiew\" is much more widely used than variant \"Kyjiw\", promoted by Ukrainian diplomats and activists. In spite of form \"Kyjiw\" being recognized by [[Duden]] dictionary as one of two possible variants, German [[Federal Foreign Office]] stated that ''\u00abfor cities, it is recommended to use established German names, if such already existed in 1933\u00bb''.<ref name=\"badische\"/> However, most of the names of other Ukrainian cities in German (save those being part of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the past) are based on Ukrainian names, as there was no established usage until recently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://p.dw.com/p/3RwDK|title=Kiew \u0447\u0438 Kyjiw: \u044f\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u044c \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044e \u0442\u0430 \u0456\u043d\u0448\u0456 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u041d\u0456\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0456|trans-title=Kiew or Kyjiw: how Ukrainian capital and other cities are called in Germany|language=Ukrainian|last=Bilyk|first=Danylo|date=28 October 2019|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|archive-url=http://archive.is/lMBfb|archive-date=19 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kiev#Name]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|450px}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1_e1r1xub6Q0SswJ6xrxzhhijowAw-kK6&z=4 Map of establishments which switched to \"Kyiv\"] in [[Google Maps]]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/notes/correctua/\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438-\u043a\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0457-\u043c\u0437\u0441-correctua/789448441454158/ List of establishments which switched to \"Kyiv\"]\n* [https://hromadske.ua/tags/correctua News about #CorrectUA] on [[Hromadske.TV]]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/Kyivnotkiev KyivNotKiev page on Facebook]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/CorrectUA CorrectUA page on Facebook]\n* [https://twitter.com/correctua CorrectUA page on Facebook]\n* [https://twitter.com/hashtag/KyivNotKiev Hashtag #KyivNotKiev on Twitter]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/kyivnotkiev Hashtag #KyivNotKiev on Facebook]\n* [https://twitter.com/hashtag/CorrectUA Hashtag #CorrectUA on Twitter]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/correctua Hashtag #CorrectUA on Facebook]\n\n[[Category:English language]]\n[[Category:Kiev]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:KyivNotKiev.svg|right|thumb|250x250px|Campaign logo]]\n'''KyivNotKiev''' (part of a wider campaign '''CorrectUA''')&nbsp;is an online campaign started by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)]] together with the Center for strategical communications \"StratCom Ukraine\" on October 2, 2018 with a goal of persuading [[English language]] media and organizations to use \"[[Kiev|Kyiv]]\" (derived from [[Ukrainian language]] name) instead of \"Kiev\" (derived from [[Russian language]] name) as the name of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002020818/https://mfa.gov.ua/ua/page/open/id/5418|title=\u041c\u0417\u0421 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0443 \u2013 \u0432\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439 #KyivNotKiev|trans-title=MFA addresses the World - use #KyivNotKiev|language=Ukrainian|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|MFA of Ukraine]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-45718643|title=#KyivNotKiev: \u041c\u0417\u0421 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0454 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432|trans-title=#KyivNotKiev: MFA asks the World to correctly spell Kyiv|language=Ukrainian|date=3 October 2018|publisher=[[BBC News Ukrainian]]|archive-url=http://archive.is/97sKP|archive-date=17 January 2020|accessdate=17 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The motivations for the campaign is that the MFA of Ukraine, as well as the majority of Ukrainian citizens, considers the transliteration \"Kiev\" in English language to be a \"Soviet colonial relict\" and struggles to restore Ukrainian identity, throwing away anything linking Ukraine to Soviet and imperial Russian past.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ua.korrespondent.net/ukraine/4065785-pysaty-Kyiv-a-ne-Kiev-chomu-tse-vazhlyvo|title=\u041f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438 Kyiv, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 Kiev. \u0427\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0446\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e?|trans-title=Writing Kyiv, but not Kiev.

In this way, ten of the most influential (in the opinion of the MFA) English language global medias were covered: [[Reuters]], [[CNN]], [[BBC News]], [[Al Jazeera]], [[Daily Mail]], [[The Washington Post]], [[The New York Times]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[Euronews]]. Some of Ukrainian top officials participated in this act: apart from then Minister of foreign affairs [[Pavlo Klimkin]], there also participated the action Minister of healthcare [[Ulana Suprun]], Representative of Ukraine at the Council of Europe [[Dmytro Kuleba]] and the member of parliament [[Yehor Soboliev]]. The campaign saw support of several thousands of Ukrainians, and the hashtag \"#KyivNotKiev\" have been seen by some 10 million social network users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/29557242.html|title=\u0427\u0438 \u0437\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0441\u044f Kiev \u043d\u0430 Kyiv? \u0420\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0457, \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0456\u0430|trans-title=Did it change from Kiev to Kyiv?

Definite article is rarely used before the names of independent states, but is often used before names of regions of countries. This norm established during the Soviet times, when Ukraine was not an independent state yet, and continuing to use a definite article before country's name is seen by many Ukrainians as questioning Ukrainian sovereignty. This situation is particularly acute after beginning of the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|Russian military intervention into Ukraine]].

Starting from 2007, there were [[Talk:Kiev|12 discussion on proposed page rename]], none of them resulting in the article title being changed. Because of supporters of the name \"Kyiv\" starting new rename requests without having any new arguments since the last time, a rename moratorium was imposed, expiring July 1, 2020.\n\nThe only known attempt by Ukrainian government to influence Wikipedia was a letter from [[Kiev City State Administration]] to [[Wikimedia Foundation]] (organization running Wikipedia) with a request to correct \"Kiev\" into \"Kyiv\".\n\n== Name of Kiev in [[German language]] ==\nThe problem of the name of Ukrainian capital being transliterated from Russian variant instead of Ukrainian is present not only in English, but also in majority of European languages, e.g. in [[German language]], where variant \"Kiew\" is much more widely used than variant \"Kyjiw\", promoted by Ukrainian diplomats and activists.

{"title_page": "Kalam cosmological argument", "text_new": "{{short description|Argument for the existence of God}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}The '''Kal\u0101m cosmological argument''' is a modern formulation of the [[cosmological argument]] for the [[existence of God]]; named for the ''[[kalam]]'' (medieval Islamic scholasticism), it was popularized by  [[William Lane Craig]] in his  ''[[The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument]]'' (1979).\n\nThe argument is similar to the [[unmoved mover]] in [[Aristotelianism]] due to its basis in the nature of causality and argument against the possibility of an infinite regress. However, [[Aristotle]] himself did not believe in a temporally finite universe and his argument is concerned with simultaneously existing causes. The Kal\u0101m argument is named after the Arabic word for \"speech\" ({{lang-ar|\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645}}) because Craig, arguing against the possibility of the existence of [[actual infinities]] in time, traced the idea to 11th-century Persian Muslim scholastic philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]]. The implication of the name is that God spoke (or, to be more precise, willed) the universe into existence.\n \nSince Craig's original publication, the  Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and [[Graham Oppy]], [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]], [[J.

For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth.\"<ref>[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]: 149</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n{{off topic|date=September 2014}}\nThe Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the [[unmoved mover|prime-mover]], introduced by [[Aristotle]], and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy  in Late Antiquity, being developed by [[John Philoponus]].<ref>Duncan, S., ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955'' (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165.</ref> Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the [[Sunni]] tradition.\n\nIts historic proponents include [[Al-Kindi]],<ref>[[Al-Kindi]], On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L.

His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work \"On First Philosophy\".<ref>Nasr, trans.

It was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), and in the 12th by [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes).<ref>Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58</ref> It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (I, q.2, a.3) and ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]'' (I, 13).\n\nIslamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and [[Averroes]], and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and [[Muhammad Iqbal]].<ref>Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986</ref> Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite ''per se'' is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite ''per accidens''. He writes:\n\n:\"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum.

Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience.

He writes:\n\n:\"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused.

This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nAndrew Loke has argued against the metaphysical possibility of a beginningless universe as well as that of an actual infinite existing in the real world.<ref>[[#Andrew2017|Loke, 2017)]], 55-61, 67-68</ref>\n\nAnother criticism comes from Thomist philosopher [https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/09/yeah-but-is-it-actually-actually.html Dr. Edward Feser] who claims that past and future events are potential rather than actual, meaning that an infinite past could exist in a similar way to how an infinite number of potential halfway points exist between any two given points (as was discussed in one of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]'s paradoxes).\n\n====Traversing an Infinite====\n\nAn alternative way to argue against the past eternity of the universe is through the impossibility of traversing  (counting/crossing/completing) infinity. The argument generally goes something like this:\n\n#If the past were infinitely long, an infinite amount of time would have had to pass before today.\n#An infinite amount of time can never truly pass (because infinite time would never run out).\n#Therefore, the universe cannot be infinitely old.\n#Therefore, the universe began to exist. \n\nThis argument presupposes presentism or the A Theory of time. If A Theory is correct, all past moments would have to occur before the present, which would vindicate the first premise. The second premise follows also from A Theory along with the nature of infinity being endless. Therefore, it follows that the universe cannot be infinitely old and began to exist.\n\n===Conclusion: \"The universe has a cause.\"===\n\nGiven that the Kalam cosmological argument is a [[deductive argument]], if both premises are true, the truth of the conclusion follows necessarily.\n\nIn a critique of Craig's book ''The Kalam Cosmological Argument'',<ref>[[#Craig79|Craig, 1979]]</ref> published in 1979, Michael Martin states:\n:\"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a ''non sequitur''. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref>\nMartin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation \"''ex nihilo''\", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent \"creating\" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103\u201314</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent ''Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'', published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by [[logical consequence|entailment]] from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 193\u2013194</ref>\n\n#A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ''ex nihilo'' in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (''timeless'', ''spaceless''), ''immaterial'', and ''enormously powerful'', in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence.\n#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and ''uncaused'', otherwise an [[infinite regress]] of causes would arise.\n#[[Occam's Razor]] maintains that ''unicity'' of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause. \n#[[Agency (philosophy)|Agent causation]], volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only ''personal, free agency'' can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. \n#[[Abstract objects]], the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power.\n\nCraig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an \"uncaused, personal Creator ... who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful\"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.\n\nIn addition to the above arguments, several points can be made which draw further conclusions about the nature of the cause.\n#The Principle of Proportional Causality (PPC), which states that whatever is present in the effect must be somehow present in the cause, would require the patterns and information of the universe to be present within the cause somehow. Since this information cannot exist in a material way (e.g., how a ball possesses a spherical pattern), it must exist in an immaterial way. But for information to exist in an immaterial way is what is classically defined as intellect (e.g. the mental concept of a sphere). Therefore, the cause must possess all information in the universe and is thus all-knowing.\n#If the PPC is not accepted, given that the cause of the universe must be a personal and free agent, the complexity and precision of the universe implies extreme intelligence.\n#In addition to Occam's Razor, it may be argued that the unicity and coherence of the universe implies a single agent behind the creation of the universe.\n\n===Theories of time===\n\nCraig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the [[A-series and B-series|A-theory of time]], also known as the \"tensed theory of time\" or [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]], as opposed to its alternative, the [[B-theory of time]], also known as the \"tenseless theory of time\" or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not \"begin to exist\":\n\n:\"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived.\"<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 183\u2013184</ref>\n\nCraig has defended the A-theory against objections from [[J.

However, [[Aristotle]] himself did not believe in a temporally finite universe and his argument is concerned with simultaneously existing causes. The Kal\u0101m argument is named after the Arabic word for \"speech\" ({{lang-ar|\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645}}) because Craig, arguing against the possibility of the existence of [[actual infinities]] in time, traced the idea to 11th-century Persian Muslim scholastic philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]]. The implication of the name is that God spoke (or, to be more precise, willed) the universe into existence.\n \nSince Craig's original publication, the  Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and [[Graham Oppy]], [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]], [[J. L. Mackie]] and [[Quentin Smith]], and has been used in [[Christian apologetics]].<ref>Graham Smith, \u201cArguing about the Kalam Cosmological Argument,\u201d Philo, 5(1), 2002: 34\u201361. See also: [[#SEP|Reichenbach, 2004]]</ref> According to [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and [[Richard Swinburne]] are \"among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy\",<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 101</ref> while also noting that, in reference to Craig's argument specifically, \"there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation\".<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref> \n\nThe Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite and/or the traversing of infinite time, which is what distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments (as was mentioned) such as [[Five Ways (Aquinas)|that of Thomas Aquinas]], which rests on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress, and that of Leibniz and Clark, which uses the [[Principle of Sufficient Reason]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 October 2017 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#TypoCosmArgu |accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Form of the argument==\n\nThe most prominent form of the argument, as defended by William Lane Craig, states the Kalam cosmological argument as the following brief [[syllogism]]:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 102</ref>\n#Whatever begins to exist has a cause.\n#The universe began to exist.\n#Therefore, the universe has a cause.\n\nGiven the conclusion, Craig appends a further premise and conclusion based upon a conceptual analysis of the properties of the cause:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 194</ref>\n#The universe has a cause.\n#If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists who ''sans (without)'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful.\n#Therefore, an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and infinitely powerful.\n\nReferring to the implications of [[Classical Theism]] that follow from this argument, Craig writes:\n\n:\"... transcending the entire universe there exists a cause which brought the universe into being ''[[ex nihilo]]'' ... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth.\"<ref>[[#CrgKC|Craig, 2000]]: 149</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\n{{off topic|date=September 2014}}\nThe Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the [[unmoved mover|prime-mover]], introduced by [[Aristotle]], and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy  in Late Antiquity, being developed by [[John Philoponus]].<ref>Duncan, S., ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955'' (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165.</ref> Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the [[Sunni]] tradition.\n\nIts historic proponents include [[Al-Kindi]],<ref>[[Al-Kindi]], On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L. Ivry (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1974), pp. 67\u201375</ref> [[Al-Ghazali]],<ref>al Ghazali, Kitab al lqtisad, with a foreword by \u00ce. A. \u00c7ubuk\u00e7u and H.

His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work \"On First Philosophy\".<ref>Nasr, trans. Seyyed Hossein, An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines. Albany : State University of New York Press, 1993 pp. 168</ref> He writes:\n\n:\"Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning.\"<ref name=\"Craig, 1994: 80\">[[#CrgRF|Craig, 1994]]: 80</ref>\n\nBetween the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. It was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), and in the 12th by [[Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes).<ref>Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58</ref> It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (I, q.2, a.3) and ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]'' (I, 13).\n\nIslamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and [[Averroes]], and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and [[Muhammad Iqbal]].<ref>Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986</ref> Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite ''per se'' is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite ''per accidens''. He writes:\n\n:\"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.\"<ref>Al-Ghazzali, Tahafut Al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of Philosophers), translated by Sabih Ahmad Kamali. Lahore: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1963 pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad Iqbal]] also stated:\n\n:\"A finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds.\"\n\n==Contemporary influence==\n\nAccording to atheist philosopher [[Quentin Smith]], \"a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig\u2019s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher\u2019s contemporary formulation of an argument for God\u2019s existence.\"<ref>Quentin Smith, \"Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism\", in Michael Martin (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 183</ref>\n\nThe Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as [[J. L.

Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience.

He writes:\n\n:\"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused.

The true relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn\u2019t this or that particular arrangement of the fields\u2014what it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple ''absence'' of the fields.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/a-universe-from-nothing-by-lawrence-m-krauss.html?_r=0 On the Origin of Everything], David Albert, The New York Times, March 2012</ref>\n\nLikewise, Craig has argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as 'nothing', therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as 'uncaused'.

This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nAndrew Loke has argued against the metaphysical possibility of a beginningless universe as well as that of an actual infinite existing in the real world.<ref>[[#Andrew2017|Loke, 2017)]], 55-61, 67-68</ref>\n\nAnother criticism comes from Thomist philosopher [https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/09/yeah-but-is-it-actually-actually.html Dr. Edward Feser] who claims that past and future events are potential rather than actual, meaning that an infinite past could exist in a similar way to how an infinite number of potential halfway points exist between any two given points (as was discussed in one of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]'s paradoxes).\n\n====Traversing an Infinite====\n\nAn alternative way to argue against the past eternity of the universe is through the impossibility of traversing  (counting/crossing/completing) infinity. The argument generally goes something like this:\n\n#If the past were infinitely long, an infinite amount of time would have had to pass before today.\n#An infinite amount of time can never truly pass (because infinite time would never run out).\n#Therefore, the universe cannot be infinitely old.\n#Therefore, the universe began to exist. \n\nThis argument presupposes presentism or A Theory of time. If A Theory is correct, all past moments would have to occur before the present, which would vindicate the first premise. The second premise follows also from A Theory along with the nature of infinity being endless. Therefore, it follows that the universe cannot be infinitely old and began to exist.\n\n===Conclusion: \"The universe has a cause.\"===\n\nGiven that the Kalam cosmological argument is a [[deductive argument]], if both premises are true, the truth of the conclusion follows necessarily.\n\nIn a critique of Craig's book ''The Kalam Cosmological Argument'',<ref>[[#Craig79|Craig, 1979]]</ref> published in 1979, Michael Martin states:\n:\"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a ''non sequitur''. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation.\"<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103</ref>\nMartin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation \"''ex nihilo''\", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent \"creating\" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.<ref>[[#Mart|Martin, 1990]]: 103\u201314</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent ''Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology'', published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by [[logical consequence|entailment]] from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 193\u2013194</ref>\n\n#A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ''ex nihilo'' in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (''timeless'', ''spaceless''), ''immaterial'', and ''enormously powerful'', in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence.\n#Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and ''uncaused'', otherwise an [[infinite regress]] of causes would arise.\n#[[Occam's Razor]] maintains that ''unicity'' of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause. \n#[[Agency (philosophy)|Agent causation]], volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only ''personal, free agency'' can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. \n#[[Abstract objects]], the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power.\n\nCraig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an \"uncaused, personal Creator ... who ''sans'' the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful\"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.\n\nIn addition to the above arguments, several points can be made which draw further conclusions about the nature of the cause.\n#The Principle of Proportional Causality (PPC), which states that whatever is present in the effect must be somehow present in the cause, would require the patterns and information of the universe to be present within the cause somehow. Since this information cannot exist in a material way (e.g., how a ball possesses a spherical pattern), it must exist in an immaterial way. But for information to exist in an immaterial way is what is classically defined as intellect (e.g. the mental concept of a sphere). Therefore, the cause must possess all information in the universe and is thus all-knowing.\n#If the PPC is not accepted, given that the cause of the universe must be a personal and free agent, the complexity and precision of the universe implies extreme intelligence.\n#In addition to Occam's Razor, it may be argued that the unicity and coherence of the universe implies a single agent behind the creation of the universe.\n\n===Theories of time===\n\nCraig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the [[A-series and B-series|A-theory of time]], also known as the \"tensed theory of time\" or [[Philosophical presentism|presentism]], as opposed to its alternative, the [[B-theory of time]], also known as the \"tenseless theory of time\" or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not \"begin to exist\":\n\n:\"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived.\"<ref>[[#CrgBC|Craig and Moreland, 2009]]: 183\u2013184</ref>\n\nCraig has defended the A-theory against objections from [[J.

It was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2006 in Japan and North America, and in 2007 in Europe and Australia. After the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the release, a port for [[Wii]] was developed by [[Ready at Dawn]], [[Tose (company)|Tose]], and Capcom, and released in 2008.\n\nSet in [[classical Japan]], ''\u014ckami'' combines [[Japanese mythology]] and [[Japanese folklore|folklore]] to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the [[Shinto]] [[Solar deity|sun goddess]], named [[Amaterasu (\u014ckami)|Amaterasu]], who took the form of a white [[wolf]]. It features a [[Ink and wash painting|sumi-e]]-inspired [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] visual style and the [[#Celestial Brush|Celestial Brush]], a [[mouse gesture|gesture-system]] to perform miracles. The game was planned to use more traditional realistic rendering, but this had put a strain on the graphics processing of the PlayStation 2. Clover Studio switched to a cel-shaded style to reduce the processing, which led to the Celestial Brush concept. The gameplay is modeled on ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', one of director [[Hideki Kamiya]]'s favorite series.\n\n''\u014ckami'' is one of the last PlayStation 2 games released prior to the release of the [[PlayStation 3]]. Although it suffered from poor sales, the game received critical acclaim, earning [[IGN]]'s 2006 [[Game of the Year]]. The Wii version earned similar praise, though the motion control scheme received mixed reviews. A [[High-definition video|high-definition]] port, remastered by Capcom and [[HexaDrive]], was released on the [[PlayStation 3]] via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012, supporting the use of the [[PlayStation Move]] motion controller. The port was also released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in December 2017 worldwide, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] in August 2018. Mainstream adoption of the game has improved with the release of these remasters, and ''\u014ckami'' is now considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]], as well as an example of [[video games as an art form]], aided by the improved art details and graphics resolutions.\n\nA sequel on the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[\u014ckamiden]],'' was released in Japan in September 2010, followed by North America and Europe in March 2011.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe player controls the main character, [[Amaterasu (\u014ckami)|Amaterasu]], in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, which looks like an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as [[ink wash painting]], or sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542741/20070131/index.jhtml | title = GameFile: '\u014ckami' Goes Green; Official Wii Word; 'Idol' Launch And More | publisher = MTV | date = 10 October 2006 | last = Totilo | first = Stephen | accessdate =10 August 2007 }}</ref> an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed ''Zelda'' fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/features/the-kamiya-touch | title = The Kamiya Touch: An Interview with Clover's Hideki Kamiya | publisher = 1up | last = Mielke | first = James | date = 18 August 2006 | accessdate =10 August 2007}}</ref> The main story is primarily linear, directed by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | pages=13\u201314 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref> By completing quests, side quests, and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | pages=25\u201326 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref>\n\nCombat is staged in a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a combination of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | pages=19\u201320 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref> At the end of combat, money (as [[Japanese yen|yen]]) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage.

Most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the [[reincarnation]] of Shiranui (the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present), and do not recognize her spiritual nature. If the player depletes power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form. [[Issun-b\u014dshi|Issun]], an arrogant, inch-tall \"wandering artist\" seeking out the thirteen Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu (whom he calls \"Ammy\" or \"furball\"). He serves as a guide, dialogue [[wikt:proxy|proxy]], and as [[comic relief]]. He grows in character along with Ammy throughout the game, becoming her true friend, inspiration, and eventually her savior.<ref name=\"manual-characters\">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | publisher=Capcom | page=6}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the game, Amaterasu encounters Yami, the main antagonist and final boss of the game who resembles a small fish inside a huge sphere, whose design is altered through the different stages of the battle. Yami is also the ruler of the demons. Before battle, he drains Amaterasu of her powers and leaves her as a plain white wolf. Amaterasu regains her powers throughout the fight, but, after the fourth round, Yami destroys them all again and leaves Amaterasu in a near-dead state. However, when Issun gets everyone to believe in Amaterasu before the fifth and final round, she changes into her most powerful form and battles Yami, vanquishing him forever. In the final battle, Yami also has a huge clawed hand, which demonstrates the evil which comes from humans' hands. The word \"Yami\" means \"darkness\" in Japanese.\n\nTwo other characters also reappear several times within the quest. [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune|Waka]] appears to Amaterasu several times in the game as a beautiful young [[Fue|flute]]-playing man in costume resembling a [[tengu]] (dressed like a [[yamabushi]]). He is aware of the goddess's true identity, foretells her future, and at times battles with her. He leads the Tao Troopers whose members Abe and Kamo are based on the two famous [[Onmy\u014dd\u014d|onmy\u014dji]] [[Abe no Seimei]] and [[Kamo no Yasunori]]. Waka's dialogue, dropping French affectionate terms at times, conveys a sense of familiarity with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and has walked with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/764/764454p1.html | title = \u014ckami AU Review | last = Shea | first = Cam | date = 13 February 2007 | accessdate =11 August 2007 | work = IGN PS2 | publisher = IGN Entertainment}}</ref> The other is [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]], the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of [[sake]] available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor.<ref name=\"playtm-review\"/> Amaterasu trusts Queen [[Himiko]], the ruler of \"Sei-an City\", who is killed by one of the demons.\n\nThroughout the game, the player encounters several other characters that are inspired from Japanese folklore.<ref name=\"Folklore\">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | pages=34\u201335 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref>\n\n===Story===\n[[File:Okami-issun.jpg|thumb|Promotional artwork for the game, showing the main characters. The foreground characters include the white wolf-goddess Amaterasu, the inch-high artist Issun, the mysterious swordsman Waka, and the warrior Susano.]]\n\nThe game is set in Nippon (Japan) and it is based on Japanese folklore, beginning one hundred years in the past. The narrator describes how the white wolf [[Shiranui]] and swordsman [[Izanagi|Nagi]] fought and sealed the eight-headed demon [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]] at the cave, to save Kamiki Village and Nagi's beloved maiden [[Izanami-no-Mikoto|Nami]].\n\nIn the game's present, Nagi's descendant and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susano]], refuses to believe in Nagi's legend and frees Orochi, who escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from Nippon. [[Konohanasakuya-hime|Sakuya]], the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and asks her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist [[Issun-b\u014dshi|Issun]] (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu begins to restore the land to its normal state.<ref name=\"playtm-review\">{{cite web | url = http://play.tm/story/9446 | title = \u014ckami \u2013 Review | publisher = Play.tm | date = 27 February 2007 | last = Smith | first = Steve | accessdate = 10 August 2007 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045651/http://play.tm/story/9446 | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThroughout her journey, Amaterasu confronts Waka, a handsome and strange but powerful individual who seems to have the gift of foresight and further teases Amaterasu and Issun to his own mysterious ends. Additionally, Amaterasu locates several Celestial Gods hidden in constellations, who bestow upon her their powers of the Celestial Brush to aid in her quest.\n\nAfter Amaterasu and Susano defeat Orochi to save [[Kushinadahime|Kushi]], recreating past events, Orochi's spirit floats northward. Amaterasu and Issun embark on a journey across Nippon, first arriving at Ryoshima Coast and Sei-An City, the capital of Nippon. There, they work with the beautiful priestess Rao, the legendary submarine Dragon Kingdom, and the reclusive Queen Himiko to rid the coastline and city of Orochi's influence, including destroying a demonic plague and retrieving a mystical weapon from a sunken trading ship. However, it is revealed that the real Rao was killed before Amaterasu arrived, and the Rao they had been working with was the demonic fox god, Ninetails, who murders Himiko before returning to her fortress on the elusive Oni Island. Amaterasu and Issun eventually find and kill Ninetails, noticing that her spirit, like Orochi's, travels to the icy northern island of Kamui. The two decide to travel northward to find the source of the demons.\n\nIn Kamui, Amaterasu assists the Oina tribe to defeat two recently revived demons, Lechku and Nechku, who were creating a deadly blizzard that threatened to destroy the island. In addition to this, Amaterasu discovers that Issun ran away from his home of Ponc'tan to escape his responsibility of being a Celestial Envoy{{mdash}}a messenger of the gods{{mdash}}and his abusive grandfather. After defeating Lechku and Nechku, Amaterasu discovers the wreckage of a flying ship made of iron: the \"Ark of Yamato\", trapped in the frozen plains of Kamui. Waka appears and reveals himself to be a member of the Moon Tribe, a long-living race who used the Ark to sail and escape from the Celestial Plain that Orochi invaded. The demons attacked and killed the rest of the Celestials before the Ark fell to earth, releasing the demons upon the mortal world. After defeating the spirits of the felled demons again at the Ark, Amaterasu confronts Yami, the machine-esque leader of the demons who led the genocide of the gods ages ago. After a long battle, Yami drains her power and nearly destroys the Celestial Gods. Before it can do so, Issun, finally accepting his role as a Celestial Envoy, encourages all those they have helped to send their thoughts and prayers to Amaterasu, who regains her powers and defeats Yami, ridding Nippon of all  demons.

[[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Clover Studio]] and published by [[Capcom]]. It was released for [[PlayStation 2]] in 2006 in Japan and North America, and in 2007 in Europe and Australia. After the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the release, a port for [[Wii]] was developed by [[Ready at Dawn]], [[Tose (company)|Tose]], and Capcom, and released in 2008.\n\nSet in [[classical Japan]], ''\u014ckami'' combines [[Japanese mythology]] and [[Japanese folklore|folklore]] to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the [[Shinto]] [[Solar deity|sun goddess]], named [[Amaterasu (\u014ckami)|Amaterasu]], who took the form of a white [[wolf]]. It features a [[Ink and wash painting|sumi-e]]-inspired [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] visual style and the [[#Celestial Brush|Celestial Brush]], a [[mouse gesture|gesture-system]] to perform miracles. The game was planned to use more traditional realistic rendering, but this had put a strain on the graphics processing of the PlayStation 2. Clover Studio switched to a cel-shaded style to reduce the processing, which led to the Celestial Brush concept. The gameplay is modeled on ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', one of director [[Hideki Kamiya]]'s favorite series.\n\n''\u014ckami'' is one of the last PlayStation 2 games released prior to the release of the [[PlayStation 3]]. Although it suffered from poor sales, the game received critical acclaim, earning [[IGN]]'s 2006 [[Game of the Year]]. The Wii version earned similar praise, though the motion control scheme received mixed reviews. A [[High-definition video|high-definition]] port, remastered by Capcom and [[HexaDrive]], was released on the [[PlayStation 3]] via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012, supporting the use of the [[PlayStation Move]] motion controller. The port was also released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in December 2017 worldwide, and for [[Nintendo Switch]] in August 2018. Mainstream adoption of the game has improved with the release of these remasters, and ''\u014ckami'' is now considered to be one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]], as well as an example of [[video games as an art form]], aided by the improved art details and graphics resolutions.\n\nA sequel on the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[\u014ckamiden]],'' was released in Japan in September 2010, followed by North America and Europe in March 2011.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe player controls the main character, [[Amaterasu (\u014ckami)|Amaterasu]], in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, which looks like an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as [[ink wash painting]], or sumi-e) with other styles of art.

Most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the [[reincarnation]] of Shiranui (the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present), and do not recognize her spiritual nature. If the player depletes power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form. [[Issun-b\u014dshi|Issun]], an arrogant, inch-tall \"wandering artist\" seeking out the thirteen Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu (whom he calls \"Ammy\" or \"furball\"). He serves as a guide, dialogue [[wikt:proxy|proxy]], and as [[comic relief]]. He grows in character along with Ammy throughout the game, becoming her true friend, inspiration, and eventually her savior.<ref name=\"manual-characters\">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | publisher=Capcom | page=6}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the game, Amaterasu encounters Yami, the main antagonist and final boss of the game who resembles a small fish inside a huge sphere, whose design is altered through the different stages of the battle. Yami is also the ruler of the demons. Before battle, he drains Amaterasu of her powers and leaves her as a plain white wolf. Amaterasu regains her powers throughout the fight, but, after the fourth round, Yami destroys them all again and leaves Amaterasu in a near-dead state. However, when Issun gets everyone to believe in Amaterasu before the fifth and final round, she changes into her most powerful form and battles Yami, vanquishing him forever. In the final battle, Yami also has a huge clawed hand, which demonstrates the evil which comes from humans' hands. The word \"Yami\" means \"darkness\" in Japanese.\n\nTwo other characters also reappear several times within the quest. [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune|Waka]] appears to Amaterasu several times in the game as a beautiful young [[Fue|flute]]-playing man in costume resembling a [[tengu]] (dressed like a [[yamabushi]]). He is aware of the goddess's true identity, foretells her future, and at times battles with her. He leads the Tao Troopers whose members Abe and Kamo are based on the two famous [[Onmy\u014dd\u014d|onmy\u014dji]] [[Abe no Seimei]] and [[Kamo no Yasunori]]. Waka's dialogue, dropping French affectionate terms at times, conveys a sense of familiarity with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and has walked with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/764/764454p1.html | title = \u014ckami AU Review | last = Shea | first = Cam | date = 13 February 2007 | accessdate =11 August 2007 | work = IGN PS2 | publisher = IGN Entertainment}}</ref> The other is [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]], the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of [[sake]] available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor.<ref name=\"playtm-review\"/> Amaterasu trusts Queen [[Himiko]], the ruler of \"Sei-an City\", who is killed by one of the demons.\n\nThroughout the game, the player encounters several other characters that are inspired from Japanese folklore.<ref name=\"Folklore\">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=\u014ckami instruction manual | pages=34\u201335 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref>\n\n===Story===\n[[File:Okami-issun.jpg|thumb|Promotional artwork for the game, showing the main characters. The foreground characters include the white wolf-goddess Amaterasu, the inch-high artist Issun, the mysterious swordsman Waka, and the warrior Susano.]]\n\nThe game is set in Nippon (Japan) and it is based on Japanese folklore, beginning one hundred years in the past. The narrator describes how the white wolf [[Shiranui]] and swordsman [[Izanagi|Nagi]] fought and sealed the eight-headed demon [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]] at the cave, to save Kamiki Village and Nagi's beloved maiden [[Izanami-no-Mikoto|Nami]].\n\nIn the game's present, Nagi's descendant and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susano]], refuses to believe in Nagi's legend and frees Orochi, who escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from Nippon. [[Konohanasakuya-hime|Sakuya]], the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and asks her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist [[Issun-b\u014dshi|Issun]] (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu begins to restore the land to its normal state.<ref name=\"playtm-review\">{{cite web | url = http://play.tm/story/9446 | title = \u014ckami \u2013 Review | publisher = Play.tm | date = 27 February 2007 | last = Smith | first = Steve | accessdate = 10 August 2007 |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045651/http://play.tm/story/9446 | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThroughout her journey, Amaterasu confronts Waka, a handsome and strange but powerful individual who seems to have the gift of foresight and further teases Amaterasu and Issun to his own mysterious ends. Additionally, Amaterasu locates several Celestial Gods hidden in constellations, who bestow upon her their powers of the Celestial Brush to aid in her quest.\n\nAfter Amaterasu and Susano defeat Orochi to save [[Kushinadahime|Kushi]], recreating past events, Orochi's spirit floats northward. Amaterasu and Issun embark on a journey across Nippon, first arriving at Ryoshima Coast and Sei-An City, the capital of Nippon. There, they work with the beautiful priestess Rao, the legendary submarine Dragon Kingdom, and the reclusive Queen Himiko to rid the coastline and city of Orochi's influence, including destroying a demonic plague and retrieving a mystical weapon from a sunken trading ship. However, it is revealed that the real Rao was killed before Amaterasu arrived, and the Rao they had been working with was the demonic fox god, Ninetails, who murders Himiko before returning to her fortress on the elusive Oni Island. Amaterasu and Issun eventually find and kill Ninetails, noticing that her spirit, like Orochi's, travels to the icy northern island of Kamui. The two decide to travel northward to find the source of the demons.\n\nIn Kamui, Amaterasu assists the Oina tribe to defeat two recently-revived demons, Lechku and Nechku, who were creating a deadly blizzard that threatened to destroy the island. In addition to this, Amaterasu discovers that Issun ran away from his home of Ponc'tan to escape his responsibility of being a Celestial Envoy{{mdash}}a messenger of the gods{{mdash}}and his abusive grandfather. After defeating Lechku and Nechku, Amaterasu discovers the wreckage of a flying ship made of iron: the \"Ark of Yamato\", trapped in the frozen plains of Kamui. Waka appears and reveals himself to be a member of the Moon Tribe, a long-living race who used the Ark to sail and escape from the Celestial Plain that Orochi invaded. The demons attacked and killed the rest of the Celestials before the Ark fell to earth, releasing the demons upon the mortal world. After defeating the spirits of the felled demons again at the Ark, Amaterasu confronts Yami, the machine-esque leader of the demons who led the genocide of the gods ages ago. After a long battle, Yami drains her power and nearly destroys the Celestial Gods. Before it can do so, Issun, finally accepting his role as a Celestial Envoy, encourages all those they have helped to send their thoughts and prayers to Amaterasu, who regains her powers and defeats Yami, ridding Nippon of all  demons. Amaterasu and Waka take control on the Ark and sail back to the Celestial Plain, determined to rebuild the land of the gods.\n\n==Development==\n''\u014ckami'' resulted from the combined ideas of Clover Studio.<ref name=\"gamespy-inaba\"/> The game was originally built around \"depict[ing] a lot of nature\", but had no central concept or theme, according to lead designer [[Hideki Kamiya]].<ref name=\"okami prototype\">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/news/platinum-games-kamiya-reflects-bayonetta | title = Platinum Games' Kamiya Reflects on Bayonetta, Okami | first = Kevin | last = Grifford | date = 4 November 2009 | accessdate = 5 November 2009 | website = [[1UP.com]] |url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019205741/http://www.1up.com/news/platinum-games-kamiya-reflects-bayonetta | archivedate = 19 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Kamiya eventually created a minute-long demonstration movie showing a wolf running about a forest, with flowers blossoming in its wake, but still lacking any gameplay.

This means that the Year 6 benchmark will not be done.\n# In the case for students who are in Year 7, Year 8, Year 9 and Year 10, they will progress to their next year in the same group respectively.\n# The SEC examinations (O Levels) will not be done in the session beginning on the 23rd of April. A predictive assessment method undertaken by MATSEC will instead be utilised. This will be based on the marks obtained during the mock exams. To establish the result, MATSEC will take into consideration the students\u2019 marks, the corrected examination papers and the marking schemes that were used.\n# MATSEC will then issue a certificate to successful students, showing whether Level 2 or Level 3 was reached. This certificate will allow students with the opportunity to progress into post-secondary schools. \n# The opportunity will be also given to students, if they wish to do so, to sit for the SEC examinations during the September session.\n# Intermediate and A Level exams will not be held during the session starting on the 23rd of April, but will instead be postponed to September of this year. Students will be receiving timetables and all details. \n# The re-sit session will be done in December. This being said, all the necessary provisions will be undertaken so that students be given the opportunity to enrol into University, MCAST, ITS or other educational institutions in the coming academic year.\n# In the case of students who are currently undergoing their studies in University, MCAST, ITS or other educational institutions, the necessary arrangements will be done so that they are able to continue their studies. Online teaching will, of course, continue, and they encourage all students, irrespective of whether they are kids or young people, to continue with their learning and studies.\n\n===First case till local transmission===\n{{Side box \n | metadata=No<!--The value 'No' apparently makes the box display on the mobile site-->\n | above = '''SARS-CoV-2 cases and COVID-19 recoveries in Malta'''\n | abovestyle = text-align:center\n | text = {{Graph:Chart\n | width = 300\n | height = 120\n | type = line\n | yGrid =\n | xGrid =\n | xAxisAngle = -60\n | x = 7/3, 8/3, 9/3, 10/3, 11/3, 12/3, 13/3, 14/3, 15/3, 16/3, 17/3, 18/3, 19/3, 20/3, 21/3, 22/3, 23/3, 24/3, 25/3, 26/3, 27/3, 28/3, 29/3, 30/3, 31/3, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4\n | y1 =  3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 4, 5, 3, 9, 8, 10, 5, 11, 9, 17, 17, 3, 19, 5, 5, 10, 2, 5, 13, 19, 8, 7, 11, 14, 14\n | y2 =  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0\n |legend =\n |showSymbols =\n |y1Title = Lab-confirmed\n |y2Title = Recoveries\n | xAxisTitle=day/month in 2020\n | yAxisTitle=count\n }}\n | below = Daily lab-confirmed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]] cases and [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] recoveries in Malta.\n}}\n\nOn 7 March, Malta reported its first 3 cases of coronavirus: an Italian family consisting of a 12-year-old girl and her parents, who arrived in Malta on 3 March from Rome after a holiday in Trentino.

Its relative rarity (1 in 5,000 clovers<ref name=\"auto\"/>) suggests a possible [[recessive gene]] appearing at a low frequency. Alternatively, four-leaf clovers could be caused by [[somatic mutation]] or a developmental error of environmental causes. They could also be caused by the interaction of several genes that happen to segregate in the individual plant. It is possible all four explanations could apply to individual cases. This means that multiple four-leaf clovers could be found in the same clover plant.<ref>{{cite book |title= Compendium of Symbolic and Ritual Plants in Europe: Herbs |volume= 2 |author= Marcel Cleene, Marie Claire Lejeune |publisher= Man & Culture |year= 2002}}</ref>\n\nResearchers from the University of Georgia have reported finding the gene that turns ordinary three-leaf clovers into the coveted four-leaf types. Masked by the three-leaf gene and strongly influenced by environmental condition, molecular markers now make it possible to detect the presence of the gene for four-leaves and for breeders to work with it. The results of the study, which also located two other leaf traits in the white-clover genome, were reported in the July/August 2010 edition of ''[[Crop Science (journal)|Crop Science]]'', published by the Crop Science Society of America.<ref>Tashiro, R.M., et al.
