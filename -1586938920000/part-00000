Whereas [[single-sex education]] was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.\n\nThe world's oldest co-educational school is thought to be [[Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School, Croydon]], established in 1714 in the United Kingdom, which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archbishop's school, 300 years later |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/9-may/news/uk/archbishop-s-school-300-years-later |website=The Church Times |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> This has always been a day school only.\n\nThe world's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is [[Dollar Academy]], a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland, United Kingdom. From its opening in 1818, the school admitted both boys and girls of the parish of Dollar and the surrounding area. The school continues in existence to the present day with around 1,250 pupils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollaracademy.org.uk/about-dollar |title=About Dollar |website=Dollar Academy |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first co-educational college to be founded was [[Oberlin Collegiate Institute]] in Oberlin, Ohio. It opened on December 3, 1833, with 44 students, including 29 men and 15 women. Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837, and the first three women to graduate with bachelor's degrees did so in 1840.<ref name=\"new.oberlin.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/about/history.dot|title=History {{!}} About Oberlin {{!}} Oberlin College|website=Oberlin College and Conservatory|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>  By the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex had become coeducation a fashion.\n\n==History==\nIn early civilizations, people were educated informally: primarily within the household. As time progressed, education became more structured and formal. Women often had very few rights when education started to become a more important aspect of civilization. Efforts of the ancient Greek and Chinese societies focused primarily on the education of males. In ancient Rome, the availability of education was gradually extended to women, but they were taught separately from men. The early Christians and medieval Europeans continued this trend, and single-sex schools for the privileged classes prevailed through the Reformation period.\n\nIn the 16th century, at the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic church reinforced the establishment of free elementary schools for children of all classes. The concept of universal elementary education, regardless of sex, had been created.<ref>\"Coeducation.\" (n.d.): Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia. Web. 23 October 2012.</ref> After the Reformation, coeducation was introduced in western Europe, when certain Protestant groups urged that boys and girls should be taught to read the Bible. The practice became very popular in northern England, Scotland, and colonial New England, where young children, both male and female, attended [[dame school]]s. In the late 18th century, girls gradually were admitted to town schools. The [[Society of Friends]] in England, as well as in the United States, pioneered coeducation as they did universal education, and in Quaker settlements in the British colonies, boys and girls commonly attended school together. The new free public elementary, or [[common schools]], which after the [[American Revolution]] supplanted church institutions, were almost always coeducational, and by 1900 most public high schools were coeducational as well.<ref>\"coeducation\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 23 October 2012.</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coeducation grew much more widely accepted. In Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the education of girls and boys in the same classes became an approved practice.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, there is a trend towards increased coeducational schooling with new coeducational schools opening, few new single-sex schools opening and existing single-sex schools combining or opening their doors to the opposite gender.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Murray|title=The Single Sex v Coeducation Debate and the Experience of Schools that Change Status|url=http://www.as.edu.au/content/uploads/2015/02/Final-Coeducation_Research_Paper_Feb_2015.pdf|publisher=The Armidale School|accessdate=2 January 2017|location=Armidale, NSW|date=2014}}</ref>\n\n==China==\nThe first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in [[China]] was the [[Nanjing Higher Normal Institute]], which was renamed [[National Central University]] and [[Nanjing University]]. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally, only schools established by zongzu (\u5b97\u65cf, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools such as [[Li Zhi (Ming Dynasty)|Li Zhi]]'s school in [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Yuan Mei]]'s school in [[Qing Dynasty]] enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s, women's universities were established such as [[Ginling Women's University]] and Peking Girls' Higher Normal School, but there was no coeducation in higher learning schools.\n\n[[Tao Xingzhi]], the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed ''The Audit Law for Women Students'' (\u898f\u5b9a\u5973\u5b50\u65c1\u807d\u6cd5\u6848) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president [[Guo Bingwen]], academic director [[Liu Boming (philosopher)|Liu Boming]], and such famous professors as [[Lu Zhiwei]] and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year [[Peking University]] also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was [[Jianxiong Wu]].\n\nIn 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded. The Chinese government pursued a policy of moving towards co-education and nearly all schools and universities have become mixed-sex. <ref>{{cite web |title=Single-sex Schools in China |url=https://www.hcrlaw.com/blog/single-sex-schools-in-china/ |website=Harrison, Clark, Rickerby's Solicitors |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref> In recent years, however, some female and/or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs but equal rights for education still apply to all citizens.\n\nIndigenous Muslim populations in China, the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Salar people|Salars]], find coeducation to be controversial, owing to some Islamic thought on gender roles. On the other hand, the Muslim [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s have not historically objected to coeducation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRSOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA202 |title=China's universities, 1895-1995: a century of cultural conflict|author=Ruth Hayhoe|year=1996|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=|page=202|isbn=0-8153-1859-6|accessdate= 29 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==France==\n\nAdmission to the [[Sorbonne]] was opened to girls in 1860.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUql-4-eW6QC&pg=PA35|title=La mixit\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9ducation: Enjeux pass\u00e9s et pr\u00e9sents|first1=Rebecca|last1=Rogers (Dir.)|first2=Marlaine|last2=Cacouault|date=30 January 2019|publisher=ENS Editions|via=Google Books|isbn=9782847880618}}</ref> The [[baccalaureat]] became gender-blind in 1924, giving equal chances to all girls in applying to any universities.

When classes at the campus of St. Paul's College were resumed, it continued to be mixed and changed to its present name. Some other renowned mixed-sex secondary schools in town include Hong Kong Pui Ching Middle School, [[Queen Elizabeth School, Hong Kong|Queen Elizabeth School]] and [[Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School]]. Most of the Hong Kong primary and secondary schools are mixed-sex educations, include government public schools, charter schools, and private schools.\n\n==Pakistan==\n\n{{Further|Education in Pakistan|List of colleges in Pakistan|List of universities in Pakistan}}\n[[Pakistan]] is one of the many [[Muslim]] countries where most [[school]]s, [[college]]s and [[University|universities]] are single-gender although some universities, colleges and schools are [[coeducational]]. In schools that offer O levels and A levels, co-education is quite prevalent. After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, most universities were coeducational by name but the proportion of women was less than 5%. After the [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization]] policies in the early 1980s, the government established [[Women's college]]s and [[Women's university|Women's universities]] to promote education among women who were hesitant of studying in mixed-sex environment.

Ruckleigh School in Solihull was founded by Cathleen Cartland in 1909 as a non-denominational co-educational preparatory school many decades before others followed.  Many previously [[single-sex school]]s have begun to accept both sexes in the past few decades: for example, [[Clifton College]] began to accept girls in 1987.<ref>Christine Skelton, ed.

In 1905, the Buckman Act was one of consolidation in governance and funding but separation in race and gender, with the campus that became what is now [[Florida State University]] designated to serve white females during this era, the campus that became what is now the [[University of Florida]] serving white males, and coeducation stipulated only for the campus serving black students at the site of what is now [[Florida A & M]]. Florida did not return to coeducation at UF and FSU until after World War II, prompted by the drastically increased demands placed on the higher education system by veterans studying via GI Bill programs following World War II. The Buckman arrangements officially ended with new legislation guidelines passed in 1947.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nSeveral early [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in the United States were single-sex.  Examples include [[Collegiate School (New York)|Collegiate School]], a boys' school operating in New York by 1638 (which remains a single-sex institution); and [[Boston Latin School]], founded in 1635 (which did not become coeducational until 1972).\n\nNonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at the lower levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges.

Reverent.  John Shipherd (minister) and Philo P. Stewart (missionary), became friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria. They discovered a mutual disenchantment with what they saw as the lack of strong  Christian principles among the settlers of the American West. They decided to  establish a college and a colony based on their religious beliefs, \"where they would train teachers and other Christian leaders for the  boundless most desolate fields in the West\".<ref name=\"new.oberlin.edu\"/>\n\nThe college and community succeeded in progressive causes and social justice. Oberlin's earliest graduates were women and African Americans. While Oberlin was co-educational from its founding in 1833, the college regularly admitted African American students beginning in 1835, after trustee and abolitionist, Reverent. Shipherd, cast the deciding vote to allow them entry. Women were not admitted to the baccalaureate program, which granted bachelor's degrees, until 1837. Prior to that, they received diplomas from what was called the Ladies Course. The college admitted its first group of women in 1837: Caroline Mary Rudd, Elizabeth Prall, Mary Hosford, and Mary Fletcher Kellogg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4860900|title=Single-Sex Education VS Co-Education|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nThe early success and achievement of women at [[Oberlin College]] persuaded many early women's rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country. However, for quite a while, women sometimes suffered uncivil behavior from their male classmates. The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling. Many professors had disapproved of the admission of women into their classes, citing studies that stated that women were physically incapable of higher education, and some professors found it difficult to acknowledge women's presence once they were admitted.<ref name=\"beatl.barnard.columbia\" /> Even today, some books, studies, and other arguments claim that women and men learn very differently from each other because of their brain differences.

Whereas [[single-sex education]] was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.\n\nThe world's oldest co-educational school is thought to be [[Archbishop Tenison's Church of England High School, Croydon]], established in 1714 in the United Kingdom, which admitted boys and girls from its opening onwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archbishop's school, 300 years later |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/9-may/news/uk/archbishop-s-school-300-years-later |website=The Church Times |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> This has always been a day school only.\n\nThe world's oldest co-educational day and boarding school is [[Dollar Academy]], a junior and senior school for males and females from ages 5 to 18 in Scotland, United Kingdom.

It opened on December 3, 1833, with 44 students, including 29 men and 15 women. Fully equal status for women did not arrive until 1837, and the first three women to graduate with bachelor's degrees did so in 1840.<ref name=\"new.oberlin.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/about/history.dot|title=History {{!}} About Oberlin {{!}} Oberlin College|website=Oberlin College and Conservatory|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>  By the late 20th century, many institutions of higher learning that had been exclusively for people of one sex had become coeducational.\n\n==History==\nIn early civilizations, people were educated informally: primarily within the household. As time progressed, education became more structured and formal. Women often had very few rights when education started to become a more important aspect of civilization. Efforts of the ancient Greek and Chinese societies focused primarily on the education of males. In ancient Rome, the availability of education was gradually extended to women, but they were taught separately from men. The early Christians and medieval Europeans continued this trend, and single-sex schools for the privileged classes prevailed through the Reformation period.\n\nIn the 16th century, at the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic church reinforced the establishment of free elementary schools for children of all classes. The concept of universal elementary education, regardless of sex, had been created.<ref>\"Coeducation.\" (n.d.): Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia. Web. 23 October 2012.</ref> After the Reformation, coeducation was introduced in western Europe, when certain Protestant groups urged that boys and girls should be taught to read the Bible. The practice became very popular in northern England, Scotland, and colonial New England, where young children, both male and female, attended [[dame school]]s. In the late 18th century, girls gradually were admitted to town schools. The [[Society of Friends]] in England, as well as in the United States, pioneered coeducation as they did universal education, and in Quaker settlements in the British colonies, boys and girls commonly attended school together. The new free public elementary, or [[common schools]], which after the [[American Revolution]] supplanted church institutions, were almost always coeducational, and by 1900 most public high schools were coeducational as well.<ref>\"coeducation\".

In Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the education of girls and boys in the same classes became an approved practice.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, there is a trend towards increased coeducational schooling with new coeducational schools opening, few new single-sex schools opening and existing single-sex schools combining or opening their doors to the opposite gender.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Murray|title=The Single Sex v Coeducation Debate and the Experience of Schools that Change Status|url=http://www.as.edu.au/content/uploads/2015/02/Final-Coeducation_Research_Paper_Feb_2015.pdf|publisher=The Armidale School|accessdate=2 January 2017|location=Armidale, NSW|date=2014}}</ref>\n\n==China==\nThe first mixed-sex institution of higher learning in [[China]] was the [[Nanjing Higher Normal Institute]], which was renamed [[National Central University]] and [[Nanjing University]]. For millennia in China, public schools, especially public higher learning schools, were for men. Generally, only schools established by zongzu (\u5b97\u65cf, gens) were for both male and female students. Some schools such as [[Li Zhi (Ming Dynasty)|Li Zhi]]'s school in [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Yuan Mei]]'s school in [[Qing Dynasty]] enrolled both male and female students. In the 1910s, women's universities were established such as [[Ginling Women's University]] and Peking Girls' Higher Normal School, but there was no coeducation in higher learning schools.\n\n[[Tao Xingzhi]], the Chinese advocator of mixed-sex education, proposed ''The Audit Law for Women Students'' (\u898f\u5b9a\u5973\u5b50\u65c1\u807d\u6cd5\u6848) at the meeting of Nanjing Higher Normal School held on December seventh, 1919. He also proposed that the university recruit female students. The idea was supported by the president [[Guo Bingwen]], academic director [[Liu Boming (philosopher)|Liu Boming]], and such famous professors as [[Lu Zhiwei]] and Yang Xingfo, but opposed by many famous men of the time. The meeting passed the law and decided to recruit women students next year. Nanjing Higher Normal School enrolled eight Chinese female students in 1920. In the same year [[Peking University]] also began to allow women students to audit classes. One of the most notable female students of that time was [[Jianxiong Wu]].\n\nIn 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] was founded. The Chinese government pursued a policy of moving towards co-education and nearly all schools and universities have become mixed-sex. <ref>{{cite web |title=Single-sex Schools in China |url=https://www.hcrlaw.com/blog/single-sex-schools-in-china/ |website=Harrison, Clark, Rickerby's Solicitors |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref> In recent years, however, some female and/or single-sex schools have again emerged for special vocational training needs but equal rights for education still apply to all citizens.\n\nIndigenous Muslim populations in China, the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Salar people|Salars]], find coeducation to be controversial, owing to some Islamic thought on gender roles.

In 1905, the Buckman Act was one of consolidation in governance and funding but separation in race and gender, with the campus that became what is now [[Florida State University]] designated to serve white females during this era, the campus that became what is now the [[University of Florida]] serving white males, and coeducation stipulated only for the campus serving black students at the site of what is now [[Florida A & M]]. Florida did not return to coeducation at UF and FSU until after World War II, prompted by the drastically increased demands placed on the higher education system by veterans studying via GI Bill programs following World War II. The Buckman arrangements officially ended with new legislation guidelines passed in 1947.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nSeveral early [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in the United States were single-sex.  Examples include [[Collegiate School (New York)|Collegiate School]], a boys' school operating in New York by 1638 (which remains a single-sex institution); and [[Boston Latin School]], founded in 1635 (which did not become coeducational until 1972).\n\nNonetheless, mixed-sex education existed at the lower levels in the U.S. long before it extended to colleges.

Reverent.  John Shipherd (minister) and Philo P. Stewart (missionary), became friends while spending the summer of 1832 together in nearby Elyria. They discovered a mutual disenchantment with what they saw as the lack of strong  Christian principles among the settlers of the American West. They decided to  establish a college and a colony based on their religious beliefs, \"where they would train teachers and other Christian leaders for the  boundless most desolate fields in the West\".<ref name=\"new.oberlin.edu\"/>\n\nThe college and community succeeded in progressive causes and social justice. Oberlin's earliest graduates were women and African Americans. While Oberlin was co-educational from its founding in 1833, the college regularly admitted African American students beginning in 1835, after trustee and abolitionist, Reverent. Shipherd, cast the deciding vote to allow them entry. Women were not admitted to the baccalaureate program, which granted bachelor's degrees, until 1837. Prior to that, they received diplomas from what was called the Ladies Course. The college admitted its first group of women in 1837: Caroline Mary Rudd, Elizabeth Prall, Mary Hosford, and Mary Fletcher Kellogg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4860900|title=Single-Sex Education VS Co-Education|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nThe early success and achievement of women at [[Oberlin College]] persuaded many early women's rights leaders that coeducation would soon be accepted throughout the country. However, for quite a while, women sometimes suffered uncivil behavior from their male classmates. The prejudice of some male professors proved more unsettling. Many professors had disapproved of the admission of women into their classes, citing studies that stated that women were physically incapable of higher education, and some professors found it difficult to acknowledge women's presence once they were admitted.<ref name=\"beatl.barnard.columbia\" /> Even today, some books, studies, and other arguments claim that women and men learn very differently from each other because of their brain differences.

The eligibility period for the Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year (i.e. January 1 through December 31). The [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best in film and television in 2019, were held on January 5, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/2020-golden-globes-get-airdate-nbc-1194965|title=2020 Golden Globes Get Airdate on NBC|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[1st Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best achievements in [[1943 in film|1943 filmmaking]], were held in January 1944, at the [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]] and the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].\n\nIn 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer, [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. The official name of the award thus became the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]].<ref name=\"Cecil B. deMille Award\">{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/cecil-b-demille-award-0|title=The Cecil B. deMille Award| accessdate= | work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher = Hollywood Foreign Press Association}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1963, the trophies commenced to be handed out by one or more persons (exclusively female at first) referred to as \"Miss Golden Globe\", a title renamed on January 5, 2018 to \"[[Golden Globe Ambassador]]\". The holders of the position were, traditionally, the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity, and as a point of pride, these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents.<ref name=\"New York Times 5 January 2018\">{{cite news|last1=Harel|first1=Monica Corcoran|title=Miss Golden Globe Is No More.

The New York firm [[Society Awards]] collaborated for a year with the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette's quality and gold content. It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show.<ref name=\"Golden Globe Statuette\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-503683_162-4707856.html|title=New Look For Golden Globe Statuette\n|accessdate=2012-12-27|work=cbsnews.com}}</ref>\n\nRevenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals. The most prominent beneficiary is the [[Young Artist Award]]s, presented annually by the [[Young Artist Foundation]], established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member [[Maureen Dragone]], to recognize and award excellence of young [[Hollywood]] performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged.<ref name=\"Golden Globes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hfpa.org/|title=HFPA Golden Globes \u2013 Young Artist Foundation|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=hfpa.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ABC Local\">{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=7380555|title=KABC-TV \u2013 Budding stars shine at Young Artist Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=ABCLocal.go.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023941/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fentertainment&id=7380555|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Young Artist Awards 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/presidents.html|title=Young Artist Awards \u2013 President's Message|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n===Eligibility===\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31.<ref name=\"GGRules\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/04/HFPA-Golden-Globe-Awards-Eligibility-Descriptions-Effective-2-1-15.pdf | title=Golden Globe Award Consideration Rules | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVoice-over performances and cameo appearances in which persons play themselves are disqualified from all of the film and TV acting categories.\n\nFilms must be at least 70 minutes and released for at least a seven-day run in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], starting prior to midnight on December 31. Films can be released in theaters, on [[pay-per-view]], or by digital delivery.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, films do not need to be released in the United States. At least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and they must first be released in their country of origin during a 14-month period from November 1 to December 31 prior to the Awards. However, if a film was not released in its country of origin due to censorship, it can still qualify if it had a one-week release in the United States during the qualifying calendar year. There is no limit to the number of submitted films from a given country.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nA TV program must air in the United States between the [[prime time]] hours of 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m (or 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m on Sundays). A show can air on [[broadcast television]], on basic or premium cable, or by digital delivery; it does not qualify if it is only on pay-per-view or via digital delivery of film. Also, a TV show must either be made in the United States or be a co-production financially and creatively between an American and a foreign production company. Furthermore, [[Reality television|reality]] and non-scripted shows are disqualified.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor a [[television film]], it cannot be entered in both the film and TV categories, and instead should be entered based on its original release format. If it was first aired on American television, then it can be entered into the TV categories. If it was released in theaters or on pay-per-view, then it should instead be entered into the film categories. A film festival showing does not count towards disqualifying what would otherwise be a TV program.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nActors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes during the qualifying calendar year. Actors in a TV film or miniseries must appear in at least five percent of the time in that TV film or miniseries.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\n===Screening requirements===\nActive HFPA members need to be invited to an official screening of each eligible film directly by its respective distributor or publicist. The screening must take place in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], either before the film's release or up to one week afterwards. The screening can be a regular screening in a theater with the public or a press screening; it does not need to be an HFPA member-only event. The screening must also be cleared with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] so there are not scheduling conflicts with other official screenings.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by HFPA members in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.\n\n===Nominations and voting===\nEntry forms for films need to be received by the HFPA within ten days of the official screening. TV programs should be submitted \"as early as possible\" before the deadline.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nAs part of their regular journalistic jobs, active HFPA members will participate in covering the press conferences, and interviewing cast members, of selected films and TV programs. The film press conferences need to take place either before the film's release in the Greater Los Angeles area or up to one week afterwards.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nBallots to select the nominations are sent to HFPA members in November, along with a \"Reminder List\" of eligible film and TV programs.<ref name=\"GGTime\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/award-rules\u2022entry-forms | title=Award Rules And Entry Forms | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref> Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category, numbering them 5 to 1, with 5 being their top choice. The nominees in each category are then the five selections that receive the most votes. The [[ranked voting]] is only used to break ties, with number 5 worth 5 points, number 4 worth 4 points, and so on.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nAfter the nominations are announced in mid-December, HFPA members receive the final ballots.<ref name=\"GGTime\"/> The winner in each category is selected from among the nominees by [[plurality voting]].

Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones. Until [[Ricky Gervais]] hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major [[Hollywood]] award ceremonies (the other being the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=84317|title=Ricky Gervais to Return as Golden Globes Host!|accessdate=2011-11-16 |date= 2011-11-16|publisher=ComingSoon.net}}</ref> [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]] hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSince 1993, [[Dick Clark Productions]] has produced the ceremony with [[NBC]] as broadcaster; its involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes, including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with [[CBS]] (the interim period saw it contract with cable network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] to air the ceremony). Enthusiastic over Clark's commitment, the HFPA's contract contained an unusual provision granting Dick Clark Productions the role of producer in perpetuity, as long as it continued to maintain a broadcast rights deal for the ceremony with NBC.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through 2018. However, the deal was negotiated without the HFPA's knowledge. The HFPA sued DCP over the deal, as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold; the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast. In April 2012, judge [[Howard Matz]] upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP, noting that the HFPA had a history of \"unbusiness-like display[s] of misplaced priorities\" and \"[succumbing] to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds\", in contrast to DCP, which had been \"represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA.\" Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA's enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to \"not get cancelled\", such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in 2001 without a formal vote. The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dick-clark-productions-prevails-golden-318099|title=Dick Clark Productions Prevails in Golden Globes Trial, Will Remain Show Producer|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement; details were not released, but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC, and to work with the HFPA to \"expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences\".

To replace the ceremony, NBC aired the two-hour ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'' special ''Going for Gold'' (originally scheduled as [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogramming]] for an [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|NFL playoff game]] the previous night). While NBC was initially intended to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference, the HFPA ultimately allowed other broadcasters to air it. The decision prompted broadcasts from [[CNN]], as well as [[E!]] and [[TV Guide Network]] (who aired pre- and post-show analysis, downsized from their typical red carpet coverage of major awards shows). Ultimately, NBC did not air the live, 32-minute press conference, and instead aired an hour-long [[NBC News]] special where ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' hosts [[Billy Bush]] and [[Nancy O'Dell]] relayed the results over an hour with commercials.<ref name=\"CTribune\">{{cite web |url= http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2008/01/golden-globes.html|title= Golden Globes winners?

The eligibility period for the Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year (i.e. January 1 through December 31). The [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best in film and television in 2019, were held on January 5, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/2020-golden-globes-get-airdate-nbc-1194965|title=2020 Golden Globes Get Airdate on NBC|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[1st Golden Globe Awards]], honoring the best achievements in [[1943 in film|1943 filmmaking]], were held in January 1944, at the [[20th Century Fox|20th Century-Fox]] studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including [[the Beverly Hills Hotel]] and the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].\n\nIn 1950, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer, [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. The official name of the award thus became the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]].<ref name=\"Cecil B. deMille Award\">{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/cecil-b-demille-award-0|title=The Cecil B. deMille Award| accessdate= | work=Golden Globe Awards|publisher = Hollywood Foreign Press Association}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1963, the trophies commenced to be handed out by one or more persons (exclusively female at first) referred to as \"Miss Golden Globe\", a title renamed on January 5, 2018 to \"[[Golden Globe Ambassador]]\". The holders of the position were, traditionally, the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity, and as a point of pride, these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents.<ref name=\"New York Times 5 January 2018\">{{cite news|last1=Harel|first1=Monica Corcoran|title=Miss Golden Globe Is No More.

The New York firm [[Society Awards]] collaborated for a year with the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette's quality and gold content. It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show.<ref name=\"Golden Globe Statuette\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-503683_162-4707856.html|title=New Look For Golden Globe Statuette\n|accessdate=2012-12-27|work=cbsnews.com}}</ref>\n\nRevenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals. The most prominent beneficiary is the [[Young Artist Award]]s, presented annually by the [[Young Artist Foundation]], established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member [[Maureen Dragone]], to recognize and award excellence of young [[Hollywood]] performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged.<ref name=\"Golden Globes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hfpa.org/|title=HFPA Golden Globes \u2013 Young Artist Foundation|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=hfpa.org}}</ref><ref name=\"ABC Local\">{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=7380555|title=KABC-TV \u2013 Budding stars shine at Young Artist Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=ABCLocal.go.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023941/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Fentertainment&id=7380555|archive-date=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Young Artist Awards 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/presidents.html|title=Young Artist Awards \u2013 President's Message|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n===Eligibility===\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31.<ref name=\"GGRules\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/04/HFPA-Golden-Globe-Awards-Eligibility-Descriptions-Effective-2-1-15.pdf | title=Golden Globe Award Consideration Rules | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nVoice-over performances and cameo appearances in which persons play themselves are disqualified from all of the film and TV acting categories.\n\nFilms must be at least 70 minutes and released for at least a seven-day run in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], starting prior to midnight on December 31. Films can be released in theaters, on [[pay-per-view]], or by digital delivery.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category, films do not need to be released in the United States. At least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and they must first be released in their country of origin during a 14-month period from November 1 to December 31 prior to the Awards. However, if a film was not released in its country of origin due to censorship, it can still qualify if it had a one-week release in the United States during the qualifying calendar year. There is no limit to the number of submitted films from a given country.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nA TV program must air in the United States between the [[prime time]] hours of 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m (or 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and 11:00 p.m on Sundays). A show can air on [[broadcast television]], on basic or premium cable, or by digital delivery; it does not qualify if it is only on pay-per-view or via digital delivery of film. Also, a TV show must either be made in the United States or be a co-production financially and creatively between an American and a foreign production company. Furthermore, [[Reality television|reality]] and non-scripted shows are disqualified.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor a [[television film]], it cannot be entered in both the film and TV categories, and instead should be entered based on its original release format. If it was first aired on American television, then it can be entered into the TV categories. If it was released in theaters or on pay-per-view, then it should instead be entered into the film categories. A film festival showing does not count towards disqualifying what would otherwise be a TV program.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nActors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes during the qualifying calendar year. Actors in a TV film or miniseries must appear in at least five percent of the time in that TV film or miniseries.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\n===Screening requirements===\nActive HFPA members need to be invited to an official screening of each eligible film directly by its respective distributor or publicist. The screening must take place in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], either before the film's release or up to one week afterwards. The screening can be a regular screening in a theater with the public or a press screening; it does not need to be an HFPA member-only event. The screening must also be cleared with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] so there are not scheduling conflicts with other official screenings.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nFor TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by HFPA members in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.\n\n===Nominations and voting===\nEntry forms for films need to be received by the HFPA within ten days of the official screening. TV programs should be submitted \"as early as possible\" before the deadline.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nAs part of their regular journalistic jobs, active HFPA members will participate in covering the press conferences, and interviewing cast members, of selected films and TV programs. The film press conferences need to take place either before the film's release in the Greater Los Angeles area or up to one week afterwards.<ref name=\"GGRules\"/>\n\nBallots to select the nominations are sent to HFPA members in November, along with a \"Reminder List\" of eligible film and TV programs.<ref name=\"GGTime\">{{cite web | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/award-rules\u2022entry-forms | title=Award Rules And Entry Forms | publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}</ref> Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category, numbering them 5 to 1, with 5 being their top choice.

Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones. Until [[Ricky Gervais]] hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major [[Hollywood]] award ceremonies (the other being the [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=84317|title=Ricky Gervais to Return as Golden Globes Host!|accessdate=2011-11-16 |date= 2011-11-16|publisher=ComingSoon.net}}</ref> [[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]] hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSince 1993, [[Dick Clark Productions]] has produced the ceremony with [[NBC]] as broadcaster; its involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes, including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with [[CBS]] (the interim period saw it contract with cable network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] to air the ceremony). Enthusiastic over Clark's commitment, the HFPA's contract contained an unusual provision granting Dick Clark Productions the role of producer in perpetuity, as long as it continued to maintain a broadcast rights deal for the ceremony with NBC.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\"/>\n\nIn 2010, Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through 2018. However, the deal was negotiated without the HFPA's knowledge. The HFPA sued DCP over the deal, as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold; the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast. In April 2012, judge [[Howard Matz]] upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP, noting that the HFPA had a history of \"unbusiness-like display[s] of misplaced priorities\" and \"[succumbing] to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds\", in contrast to DCP, which had been \"represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA.\" Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA's enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to \"not get cancelled\", such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in 2001 without a formal vote. The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref name=\"thr-dcpsuit\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dick-clark-productions-prevails-golden-318099|title=Dick Clark Productions Prevails in Golden Globes Trial, Will Remain Show Producer|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement; details were not released, but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC, and to work with the HFPA to \"expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences\".

While NBC was initially intended to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference, the HFPA ultimately allowed other broadcasters to air it. The decision prompted broadcasts from [[CNN]], as well as [[E!]] and [[TV Guide Network]] (who aired pre- and post-show analysis, downsized from their typical red carpet coverage of major awards shows).
