The film centers on a dance teacher who comes to America from [[India]] to pursue a normal career but incidentally stumbles into a brief but high-profile career as a sex guru, a career based on a philosophy he learns from a [[Pornographic actor|pornographic actress]].\n\nThe film stars [[Jimi Mistry]] as the eponymous character, [[Heather Graham]] as the actress he learns from, and [[Marisa Tomei]], who helps him reach his guru status among her [[socialite]] [[New York City]] friends.\n\n==Plot==\nRamu Gupta ([[Jimi Mistry]]), a dance teacher, leaves his native city [[Delhi]], [[India]], to seek his fortune in the [[United States]]. He is lured by the exaggerations of his cousin, Vijay, who [[Indian American|has already moved]] to New York City. Vijay's deception is the first of several that drive the plot.\n\nSeeking work as an actor, the na\u00efve Ramu unknowingly lands a role in a [[pornographic film]]. That evening he accompanies Vijay and his roommates on a [[catering]] job at a society birthday party. When the Indian [[swami]] hired to address the party falls into drunken oblivion, Ramu takes his place. Lacking a real philosophy, he improvises by repeating advice he had been given by Sharonna ([[Heather Graham]]), an adult film actress he met earlier. Lexi ([[Marisa Tomei]]), the birthday girl, is so impressed that she promotes him as a [[New Age]] sex guru to her friends.\n\nRamu hires Sharonna, ostensibly for advice on how to be an actor in adult films, though what he really wants is more ideas he could use in his new role as the guru of sex. A personal relationship develops between the two, though Sharonna is engaged to a firefighter who thinks she's a school teacher.

The term ''[[wikt:relief|relief]]'' is from the Latin verb ''relevo'', to raise. To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relief | title= Relief | publisher= Merriam-Webster | accessdate= 2012-05-31 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120531162703/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relief | archivedate= 2012-05-31 }}</ref> What is actually performed when a relief is cut in from a flat surface of stone (relief sculpture) or wood ([[relief carving]]) is a lowering of the field, leaving the unsculpted parts seemingly raised. The technique involves considerable chiselling away of the background, which is a time-consuming exercise. On the other hand, a relief saves forming the rear of a subject, and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round, especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point, especially in stone.  In other materials such as metal, clay, plaster [[stucco]], ceramics or [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] the form can be just added to or raised up from the background, and monumental [[bronze]] reliefs are made by [[casting]].\n\nThere are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field, for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English.  The full range includes ''high relief'' (''alto-rilievo'', ''haut-relief''),<ref>In modern English, just \"high relief\"; ''alto-rilievo'' was used in the 18th century and a little beyond, while ''haut-relief'' has surprisingly found a niche, restricted to archaeological writing, in recent decades after it was used in under-translated French texts about prehistoric [[cave art]], and copied even by English writers. Its use is to be deprecated.</ref> where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas, ''mid-relief'' (''mezzo-rilievo''), ''low-relief'' (''basso-rilievo'', or French: ''bas-relief'' ({{IPA-fr|ba\u0281lij\u025bf}}), and shallow-relief or ''rilievo schiacciato'',<ref>Murray, Peter & Linda, Penguin ''Dictionary of Art & Artists'', London, 1989. p. 348, Relief; ''bas-relief'' remained common in English until the mid 20th century.</ref> where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements.  There is also ''sunk relief'', which was mainly restricted to [[Ancient Egypt]] (see below).  However, the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important, and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work.\n\nThe definition of these terms is somewhat variable, and many works combine areas in more than one of them, sometimes sliding between them in a single figure; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions.<ref>For example Avery in [[Grove Art Online]], whose long article on \"Relief sculpture\" barely mentions or defines them, except for sunk relief.</ref>  The opposite of relief sculpture is ''counter-relief'', [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]], or ''cavo-rilievo,''<ref>Murray, 1989, op.cit.</ref> where the form is cut into the field or background rather than rising from it; this is very rare in [[monumental sculpture]]. Hyphens may or may not be used in all these terms, though they are rarely seen in \"sunk relief\" and are usual in \"bas-relief\" and \"counter-relief\". Works in the technique are described as \"in relief\", and, especially in [[monumental sculpture]], the work itself is \"a relief\".\n\n[[File:Albert Memorial Friese Facing South - May 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A face of the high-relief ''[[Frieze of Parnassus]]'' round the base of the [[Albert Memorial]] in London. Most of the heads and many feet are completely undercut, but the torsos are \"engaged\" with the surface behind.]]\n\nReliefs are common throughout the world on the walls of buildings and a variety of smaller settings, and a sequence of several panels or sections of relief may represent an extended narrative.  Relief is more suitable for depicting complicated subjects with many figures and very active poses, such as battles, than free-standing \"sculpture in the round\".  Most ancient architectural reliefs were originally painted, which helped to define forms in low relief. The subject of reliefs is for convenient reference assumed in this article to be usually figures, but sculpture in relief often depicts decorative geometrical or foliage patterns, as in the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] of [[Islamic art]], and may be of any subject.\n[[File:North wall of Ara Pacis, Rome (cropped).jpg|thumb|A common mixture of high and low relief, in the Roman [[Ara Pacis]], placed to be seen from below. Low relief ornament at bottom]]\n\n[[Rock relief]]s are those carved into solid rock in the open air (if inside caves, whether natural or man-made, they are more likely to be called \"rock-cut\"). This type is found in many cultures, in particular those of the [[Ancient Near East]] and Buddhist countries.  A [[stele]] is a single standing stone; many of these carry reliefs.\n\n==Types==\nThe distinction between high and low relief is somewhat subjective, and the two are very often combined in a single work. In particular, most later \"high reliefs\" contain sections in low relief, usually in the background. From the [[Parthenon Frieze]] onwards, many single figures in large [[monumental sculpture]] have heads in high relief, but their lower legs are in low relief. The slightly projecting figures created in this way work well in reliefs that are seen from below, and reflect that the heads of figures are usually of more interest to both artist and viewer than the legs or feet.  As unfinished examples from various periods show, raised reliefs, whether high or low, were normally \"blocked out\" by marking the outline of the figure and reducing the background areas to the new background level, work no doubt performed by apprentices (see gallery).\n\n{{anchor|Bas-relief or low relief}}\n===Low relief or bas-relief===\n[[File:PupienusSest.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Low-relief on Roman [[sestertius]], 238 AD]]\nA '''low relief''' or '''bas-relief''' (\"low relief\", {{IPA-fr|ba\u0281\u0259lj\u025bf}}, from the [[Italian language|Italian]] '''basso rilievo'''; this is now a rather old-fashioned term in English) is a projecting image with a shallow overall depth, for example used on coins, on which all images are in low relief. In the lowest reliefs the relative depth of the elements shown is completely distorted, and if seen from the side the image makes no sense, but from the front the small variations in depth register as a three-dimensional image. Other versions distort depth much less.  It is a technique which requires less work, and is therefore cheaper to produce, as less of the background needs to be removed in a carving, or less modelling is required. In the [[art of Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyrian palace relief]]s, and other [[ancient Near East]]ern and Asian cultures, and also [[Meso-America]], a consistent very low relief was commonly used for the whole composition.  These images would usually be painted after carving, which helped define the forms; today the paint has worn off in the great majority of surviving examples, but minute, invisible remains of paint can usually be discovered through chemical means.\n\n[[File:Rock Relief of Iddin-Sin, King of Simurrum.jpg|thumb|A low-relief dating to circa 2000 BC, from the kingdom of [[Simurrum]], modern [[Iraq]]]]\nThe [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]], now in Berlin, has low reliefs of large animals formed from moulded bricks, glazed in colour. Plaster, which made the technique far easier, was widely used in Egypt and the [[Near East]] from antiquity into Islamic times (latterly for architectural decoration, as at the [[Alhambra]]), Rome, and Europe from at least the Renaissance, as well as probably elsewhere.  However, it needs very good conditions to survive long in unmaintained buildings \u2013 Roman decorative plasterwork is mainly known from [[Pompeii]] and other sites buried by ash from [[Mount Vesuvius]].  Low relief was relatively rare in Western [[medieval art]], but may be found, for example in wooden figures or scenes on the insides of the folding wings of multi-panel [[altarpiece]]s.\n\nThe revival of low relief, which was seen as a classical style, begins early in the Renaissance; the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]], a pioneering classicist building, designed by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around 1450, uses low reliefs by [[Agostino di Duccio]] inside and on the external walls.  Since the Renaissance plaster has been very widely used for indoor [[ornament (art)|ornamental]] work such as [[cornice]]s and ceilings, but in the 16th century it was used for large figures (many also using high relief) at the [[Chateau of Fontainebleau]], which were imitated more crudely elsewhere, for example in the Elizabethan [[Hardwick Hall]].\n\nShallow-relief, in Italian ''rilievo stiacciato'' or ''rilievo schicciato'' (\"squashed relief\"), is a very shallow relief, which merges into engraving in places, and can be hard to read in photographs.  It is often used for the background areas of compositions with the main elements in low-relief, but its use over a whole (usually rather small) piece was perfected by the Italian Renaissance sculptor [[Donatello]].<ref>Avery, vi</ref>\n\nIn later Western art, until a 20th-century revival, low relief was used mostly for smaller works or combined with higher relief to convey a sense of distance, or to give depth to the composition, especially for scenes with many figures and a landscape or architectural background, in the same way that lighter colours are used for the same purpose in painting. Thus figures in the foreground are sculpted in high-relief, those in the background in low-relief. Low relief may use any medium or technique of sculpture, [[stone carving]] and [[metal casting]] being most common.

The typical traditional definition is that only up to half of the subject projects, and no elements are undercut or fully disengaged from the background field.  The depth of the elements shown is normally somewhat distorted.\n\nMid-relief is probably the most common type of relief found in the [[Hindu art|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist art]] of [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The low to mid-reliefs of 2nd-century BCE to 6th-century CE [[Ajanta Caves]] and 5th to 10th-century [[Ellora Caves]] in India are rock reliefs. Most of these reliefs are used to narrate sacred scriptures, such as the 1,460 panels of the 9th-century [[Borobudur]] temple in [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], narrating the [[Jataka tales]] or lives of the [[Buddha]]. Other examples are low reliefs narrating the [[Ramayana]] Hindu epic in [[Prambanan]] temple, also in Java, in [[Cambodia]], the temples of [[Angkor]], with scenes including the [[Samudra manthan]] or \"Churning the Ocean of Milk\" at the 12th-century [[Angkor Wat]], and reliefs of [[apsaras]]. At [[Bayon]] temple in [[Angkor Thom]] there are scenes of daily life in the [[Khmer Empire]].\n\n===High relief===\n[[File:Ac marbles.jpg|thumb|left|'''High relief''' [[Metope (architecture)|metope]] from the Classical Greek [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles]]. Some front limbs are actually detached from the background completely, while the [[centaur]]'s left rear leg is in low relief.]]\nHigh relief (or ''altorilievo'', from [[Italian language|Italian]]) is where in general more than half the mass of the sculpted figure projects from the background. Indeed, the most prominent elements of the composition, especially heads and limbs, are often completely undercut, detaching them from the field. The parts of the subject that are seen are normally depicted at their full depth, unlike low relief where the elements seen are \"squashed\" flatter. High relief thus uses essentially the same style and techniques as free-standing sculpture, and in the case of a single figure gives largely the same view as a person standing directly in front of a free-standing statue would have. All cultures and periods in which large sculptures were created used this technique in [[monumental sculpture]] and architecture.\n\nMost of the many grand figure reliefs in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] used a very \"high\" version of high relief, with elements often fully free of the background, and parts of figures crossing over each other to indicate depth. The [[metopes of the Parthenon]] have largely lost their fully rounded elements, except for heads, showing the advantages of relief in terms of durability. High relief has remained the dominant form for reliefs with figures in Western sculpture, also being common in Indian temple sculpture. Smaller Greek sculptures such as private tombs, and smaller decorative areas such as friezes on large buildings, more often used low relief.\n[[File:Western Group of Temples, Khajuraho 20.jpg|thumb|High-relief deities at [[Khajuraho]], India]]\n\n[[Hellenistic]] and Roman [[sarcophagus]] reliefs were cut with a drill rather than [[chisel]]s, enabling and encouraging compositions extremely crowded with figures, like the [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] (250\u2013260 CE). These are also seen in the enormous strips of reliefs that wound around Roman [[triumphal column]]s. The [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in particular exerted a huge influence on later Western sculpture. The European Middle Ages tended to use high relief for all purposes in stone, though like [[Ancient Roman sculpture]], their reliefs were typically not as high as in Ancient Greece.<ref>Avery, ii and iii</ref> Very high relief re-emerged in the Renaissance, and was especially used in wall-mounted [[funerary art]] and later on [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[pediment]]s and public monuments.\n\nIn the Buddhist and Hindu art of India and Southeast Asia, high relief can also be found, although it is not as common as low to mid-reliefs. Famous examples of Indian high reliefs can be found at the [[Khajuraho]] temples, with voluptuous, twisting figures that often illustrate the erotic [[Kamasutra]] positions. In the 9th-century [[Prambanan]] temple, Central [[Java]],  high reliefs of [[Lokapala]] [[devata]]s, the guardians of deities of the directions, are found.\n\n===Sunk relief===\n[[File:Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their children.jpg|thumb|right|A '''sunk-relief''' depiction of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] with his wife [[Nefertiti]] and daughters. The main background has not been removed, merely that in the immediate vicinity of the sculpted form. Note how strong shadows are needed to define the image.]]\n\nSunk or sunken relief is largely restricted to the [[art of Ancient Egypt]] where it is very common, becoming after the [[Amarna period]] of [[Ahkenaten]] the dominant type used, as opposed to low relief. It had been used earlier, but mainly for large reliefs on external walls, and for [[hieroglyph]]s and [[cartouche]]s. The image is made by cutting the relief sculpture itself into a flat surface. In a simpler form the images are usually mostly linear in nature, like hieroglyphs, but in most cases the figure itself is in low relief, but set within a sunken area shaped round the image, so that the relief never rises beyond the original flat surface. In some cases the figures and other elements are in a very low relief that does not rise to the original surface, but others are modeled more fully, with some areas rising to the original surface. This method minimizes the work removing the background, while allowing normal relief modelling.\n\nThe technique is most successful with strong sunlight to emphasise the outlines and forms by shadow, as no attempt was made to soften the edge of the sunk area, leaving a face at a right-angle to the surface all around it. Some reliefs, especially funerary monuments with heads or busts from ancient Rome and later Western art, leave a \"frame\" at the original level around the edge of the relief, or place a head in a hemispherical recess in the block (see Roman example in gallery). Though essentially very similar to Egyptian sunk relief, but with a background space at the lower level around the figure, the term would not normally be used of such works.\n\nIt is also used for carving letters (typically ''[[om mani padme hum]]'') in the [[mani stone]]s of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].\n\n===Counter-relief===\nSunk relief technique is not to be confused with \"counter-relief\" or intaglio as seen on [[engraved gem]] [[Seal (emblem)|seals]]\u2014where an image is fully modeled in a \"negative\" manner. The image goes into the surface, so that when impressed on wax it gives an impression in normal relief. However many engraved gems were carved in [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] or normal relief.\n\nA few very late [[Hellenistic]] monumental carvings in Egypt use full \"negative\" modelling as though on a gem seal, perhaps as sculptors trained in the Greek tradition attempted to use traditional Egyptian conventions.<ref>Barasch, Moshe, ''Visual Syncretism: A Case Study'', pp.&nbsp;39\u201343 in Budick, Stanford & Iser, Wolfgang, eds., ''The Translatability of cultures: figurations of the space between'', [[Stanford University Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|0-8047-2561-6}} ({{ISBN|978-0-8047-2561-3}}).</ref>\n\n===Small objects===\n[[File:French - Diptych with Scenes from the Passion of Christ - Walters 71179 - Open.jpg|thumb|left|French Gothic [[diptych]], 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in) high, with crowded scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', c.&nbsp;1350\u20131365]]\nSmall-scale reliefs have been carved in various materials, notably [[ivory carving|ivory]], wood, and wax.  Reliefs are often found in [[decorative arts]] such as [[ceramic art|ceramics]] and [[metalwork]]; these are less often described as \"reliefs\" than as \"in relief\". Small bronze reliefs are often in the form of \"plaques\" or [[plaquette]]s, which may be set in furniture or framed, or just kept as they are, a popular form for European collectors, especially in the Renaissance.\n\nVarious modelling techniques are used, such [[repouss\u00e9]] (\"pushed-back\") in metalwork, where a thin metal plate is shaped from behind using various metal or wood punches, producing a relief image. [[Casting]] has also been widely used in [[bronze]] and other metals. Casting and repouss\u00e9 are often used in concert in to speed up production and add greater detail to the final relief. In stone, as well as engraved gems, larger [[hardstone carving]]s in semi-precious stones have been highly prestigious since ancient times in many Eurasian cultures. Reliefs in [[wax]] were produced at least from the [[Renaissance]].\n\n[[Ivory carving|Carved ivory]] reliefs have been used since ancient times, and because the material, though expensive, cannot usually be reused, they have a relatively high survival rate, and for example [[consular diptych]]s represent a large proportion of the survivals of portable secular art from [[Late Antiquity]]. In the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] the carving of ivory reliefs became a considerable [[Luxury goods|luxury]] industry in [[Paris]] and other centres. As well as small [[diptych]]s and [[triptych]]s with densely packed religious scenes, usually from the [[New Testament]], secular objects, usually in a lower relief, were also produced.\n\nThese were often round mirror-cases, combs, handles, and other small items, but included a few larger caskets like the [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in the United States. Originally they were very often painted in bright colours.  Reliefs can be impressed by stamps onto clay, or the clay pressed into a mould bearing the design, as was usual with the mass-produced {{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}} of [[Ancient Roman pottery]]. Decorative reliefs in [[plaster]] or [[stucco]] may be much larger; this form of architectural decoration is found in many styles of interiors in the post-Renaissance West, and in [[Islamic architecture]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\n<!-- BIG ENOUGH - no more additions please - take it to talk -->\nFile:G\u00f6bekli Tepe reliefs of animals.jpg|Low relief from the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] archaeological site of [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]], believed to represent a [[bull]], a [[fox]], and a [[Crane (bird)|crane]], c. 9,000 BC\nFile:Warka_vase_(background_retouched).jpg|The [[Warka Vase]] of [[Sumer]], a very early survival works of narrative relief, c. 3200\u20133000 BC.

The term ''[[wikt:relief|relief]]'' is from the Latin verb ''relevo'', to raise. To create a sculpture in relief is to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relief | title= Relief | publisher= Merriam-Webster | accessdate= 2012-05-31 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120531162703/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relief | archivedate= 2012-05-31 }}</ref> What is actually performed when a relief is cut in from a flat surface of stone (relief sculpture) or wood ([[relief carving]]) is a lowering of the field, leaving the unsculpted parts seemingly raised. The technique involves considerable chiselling away of the background, which is a time-consuming exercise. On the other hand, a relief saves forming the rear of a subject, and is less fragile and more securely fixed than a sculpture in the round, especially one of a standing figure where the ankles are a potential weak point, especially in stone.  In other materials such as metal, clay, plaster [[stucco]], ceramics or [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] the form can be just added to or raised up from the background, and monumental [[bronze]] reliefs are made by [[casting]].\n\nThere are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field, for which the Italian and French terms are still sometimes used in English.  The full range includes ''high relief'' (''alto-rilievo'', ''haut-relief''),<ref>In modern English, just \"high relief\"; ''alto-rilievo'' was used in the 18th century and a little beyond, while ''haut-relief'' has surprisingly found a niche, restricted to archaeological writing, in recent decades after it was used in under-translated French texts about prehistoric [[cave art]], and copied even by English writers. Its use is to be deprecated.</ref> where more than 50% of the depth is shown and there may be undercut areas, ''mid-relief'' (''mezzo-rilievo''), ''low-relief'' (''basso-rilievo'', or French: ''bas-relief'' ({{IPA-fr|ba\u0281lij\u025bf}}), and shallow-relief or ''rilievo schiacciato'',<ref>Murray, Peter & Linda, Penguin ''Dictionary of Art & Artists'', London, 1989. p. 348, Relief; ''bas-relief'' remained common in English until the mid 20th century.</ref> where the plane is only very slightly lower than the sculpted elements.  There is also ''sunk relief'', which was mainly restricted to [[Ancient Egypt]] (see below).  However, the distinction between high relief and low relief is the clearest and most important, and these two are generally the only terms used to discuss most work.\n\nThe definition of these terms is somewhat variable, and many works combine areas in more than one of them, sometimes sliding between them in a single figure; accordingly some writers prefer to avoid all distinctions.<ref>For example Avery in [[Grove Art Online]], whose long article on \"Relief sculpture\" barely mentions or defines them, except for sunk relief.</ref>  The opposite of relief sculpture is ''counter-relief'', [[intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]], or ''cavo-rilievo,''<ref>Murray, 1989, op.cit.</ref> where the form is cut into the field or background rather than rising from it; this is very rare in [[monumental sculpture]]. Hyphens may or may not be used in all these terms, though they are rarely seen in \"sunk relief\" and are usual in \"bas-relief\" and \"counter-relief\". Works in the technique are described as \"in relief\", and, especially in [[monumental sculpture]], the work itself is \"a relief\".\n\n[[File:Albert Memorial Friese Facing South - May 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A face of the high-relief ''[[Frieze of Parnassus]]'' round the base of the [[Albert Memorial]] in London. Most of the heads and many feet are completely undercut, but the torsos are \"engaged\" with the surface behind.]]\n\nReliefs are common throughout the world on the walls of buildings and a variety of smaller settings, and a sequence of several panels or sections of relief may represent an extended narrative.  Relief is more suitable for depicting complicated subjects with many figures and very active poses, such as battles, than free-standing \"sculpture in the round\".  Most ancient architectural reliefs were originally painted, which helped to define forms in low relief. The subject of reliefs is for convenient reference assumed in this article to be usually figures, but sculpture in relief often depicts decorative geometrical or foliage patterns, as in the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] of [[Islamic art]], and may be of any subject.\n[[File:North wall of Ara Pacis, Rome (cropped).jpg|thumb|A common mixture of high and low relief, in the Roman [[Ara Pacis]], placed to be seen from below. Low relief ornament at bottom]]\n\n[[Rock relief]]s are those carved into solid rock in the open air (if inside caves, whether natural or man-made, they are more likely to be called \"rock-cut\"). This type is found in many cultures, in particular those of the [[Ancient Near East]] and Buddhist countries.  A [[stele]] is a single standing stone; many of these carry reliefs.\n\n==Types==\nThe distinction between high and low relief is somewhat subjective, and the two are very often combined in a single work. In particular, most later \"high reliefs\" contain sections in low relief, usually in the background. From the [[Parthenon Frieze]] onwards, many single figures in large [[monumental sculpture]] have heads in high relief, but their lower legs are in low relief. The slightly projecting figures created in this way work well in reliefs that are seen from below, and reflect that the heads of figures are usually of more interest to both artist and viewer than the legs or feet.  As unfinished examples from various periods show, raised reliefs, whether high or low, were normally \"blocked out\" by marking the outline of the figure and reducing the background areas to the new background level, work no doubt performed by apprentices (see gallery).\n\n{{anchor|Bas-relief or low relief}}\n===Low relief or bas-relief===\n[[File:PupienusSest.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Low-relief on Roman [[sestertius]], 238 AD]]\nA '''low relief''' or '''bas-relief''' (\"low relief\", {{IPA-fr|ba\u0281\u0259lj\u025bf}}, from the [[Italian language|Italian]] '''basso rilievo'''; this is now a rather old-fashioned term in English) is a projecting image with a shallow overall depth, for example used on coins, on which all images are in low relief. In the lowest reliefs the relative depth of the elements shown is completely distorted, and if seen from the side the image makes no sense, but from the front the small variations in depth register as a three-dimensional image. Other versions distort depth much less.  It is a technique which requires less work, and is therefore cheaper to produce, as less of the background needs to be removed in a carving, or less modelling is required. In the [[art of Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyrian palace relief]]s, and other [[ancient Near East]]ern and Asian cultures, and also [[Meso-America]], a consistent very low relief was commonly used for the whole composition.  These images would usually be painted after carving, which helped define the forms; today the paint has worn off in the great majority of surviving examples, but minute, invisible remains of paint can usually be discovered through chemical means.\n\n[[File:Rock Relief of Iddin-Sin, King of Simurrum.jpg|thumb|A low-relief dating to circa 2000 BC, from the kingdom of [[Simurrum]], modern [[Iraq]]]]\nThe [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]], now in Berlin, has low reliefs of large animals formed from moulded bricks, glazed in colour. Plaster, which made the technique far easier, was widely used in Egypt and the [[Near East]] from antiquity into Islamic times (latterly for architectural decoration, as at the [[Alhambra]]), Rome, and Europe from at least the Renaissance, as well as probably elsewhere.  However, it needs very good conditions to survive long in unmaintained buildings \u2013 Roman decorative plasterwork is mainly known from [[Pompeii]] and other sites buried by ash from [[Mount Vesuvius]].  Low relief was relatively rare in Western [[medieval art]], but may be found, for example in wooden figures or scenes on the insides of the folding wings of multi-panel [[altarpiece]]s.\n\nThe revival of low relief, which was seen as a classical style, begins early in the Renaissance; the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]], a pioneering classicist building, designed by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around 1450, uses low reliefs by [[Agostino di Duccio]] inside and on the external walls.  Since the Renaissance plaster has been very widely used for indoor [[ornament (art)|ornamental]] work such as [[cornice]]s and ceilings, but in the 16th century it was used for large figures (many also using high relief) at the [[Chateau of Fontainebleau]], which were imitated more crudely elsewhere, for example in the Elizabethan [[Hardwick Hall]].\n\nShallow-relief, in Italian ''rilievo stiacciato'' or ''rilievo schicciato'' (\"squashed relief\"), is a very shallow relief, which merges into engraving in places, and can be hard to read in photographs.  It is often used for the background areas of compositions with the main elements in low-relief, but its use over a whole (usually rather small) piece was perfected by the Italian Renaissance sculptor [[Donatello]].<ref>Avery, vi</ref>\n\nIn later Western art, until a 20th-century revival, low relief was used mostly for smaller works or combined with higher relief to convey a sense of distance, or to give depth to the composition, especially for scenes with many figures and a landscape or architectural background, in the same way that lighter colours are used for the same purpose in painting. Thus figures in the foreground are sculpted in high-relief, those in the background in low-relief. Low relief may use any medium or technique of sculpture, [[stone carving]] and [[metal casting]] being most common.

The typical traditional definition is that only up to half of the subject projects, and no elements are undercut or fully disengaged from the background field.  The depth of the elements shown is normally somewhat distorted.\n\nMid-relief is probably the most common type of relief found in the [[Hindu art|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist art]] of [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The low to mid-reliefs of 2nd-century BCE to 6th-century CE [[Ajanta Caves]] and 5th to 10th-century [[Ellora Caves]] in India are rock reliefs. Most of these reliefs are used to narrate sacred scriptures, such as the 1,460 panels of the 9th-century [[Borobudur]] temple in [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], narrating the [[Jataka tales]] or lives of the [[Buddha]]. Other examples are low reliefs narrating the [[Ramayana]] Hindu epic in [[Prambanan]] temple, also in Java, in [[Cambodia]], the temples of [[Angkor]], with scenes including the [[Samudra manthan]] or \"Churning the Ocean of Milk\" at the 12th-century [[Angkor Wat]], and reliefs of [[apsaras]]. At [[Bayon]] temple in [[Angkor Thom]] there are scenes of daily life in the [[Khmer Empire]].\n\n===High relief===\n[[File:Ac marbles.jpg|thumb|left|'''High relief''' [[Metope (architecture)|metope]] from the Classical Greek [[Elgin Marbles]]. Some front limbs are actually detached from the background completely, while the [[centaur]]'s left rear leg is in low relief.]]\nHigh relief (or ''altorilievo'', from [[Italian language|Italian]]) is where in general more than half the mass of the sculpted figure projects from the background. Indeed, the most prominent elements of the composition, especially heads and limbs, are often completely undercut, detaching them from the field. The parts of the subject that are seen are normally depicted at their full depth, unlike low relief where the elements seen are \"squashed\" flatter. High relief thus uses essentially the same style and techniques as free-standing sculpture, and in the case of a single figure gives largely the same view as a person standing directly in front of a free-standing statue would have. All cultures and periods in which large sculptures were created used this technique in [[monumental sculpture]] and architecture.\n\nMost of the many grand figure reliefs in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] used a very \"high\" version of high relief, with elements often fully free of the background, and parts of figures crossing over each other to indicate depth. The [[metopes of the Parthenon]] have largely lost their fully rounded elements, except for heads, showing the advantages of relief in terms of durability. High relief has remained the dominant form for reliefs with figures in Western sculpture, also being common in Indian temple sculpture. Smaller Greek sculptures such as private tombs, and smaller decorative areas such as friezes on large buildings, more often used low relief.\n[[File:Western Group of Temples, Khajuraho 20.jpg|thumb|High-relief deities at [[Khajuraho]], India]]\n\n[[Hellenistic]] and Roman [[sarcophagus]] reliefs were cut with a drill rather than [[chisel]]s, enabling and encouraging compositions extremely crowded with figures, like the [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] (250\u2013260 CE). These are also seen in the enormous strips of reliefs that wound around Roman [[triumphal column]]s. The [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in particular exerted a huge influence on later Western sculpture. The European Middle Ages tended to use high relief for all purposes in stone, though like [[Ancient Roman sculpture]], their reliefs were typically not as high as in Ancient Greece.<ref>Avery, ii and iii</ref> Very high relief re-emerged in the Renaissance, and was especially used in wall-mounted [[funerary art]] and later on [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[pediment]]s and public monuments.\n\nIn the Buddhist and Hindu art of India and Southeast Asia, high relief can also be found, although it is not as common as low to mid-reliefs. Famous examples of Indian high reliefs can be found at the [[Khajuraho]] temples, with voluptuous, twisting figures that often illustrate the erotic [[Kamasutra]] positions. In the 9th-century [[Prambanan]] temple, Central [[Java]],  high reliefs of [[Lokapala]] [[devata]]s, the guardians of deities of the directions, are found.\n\n===Sunk relief===\n[[File:Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their children.jpg|thumb|right|A '''sunk-relief''' depiction of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] with his wife [[Nefertiti]] and daughters. The main background has not been removed, merely that in the immediate vicinity of the sculpted form. Note how strong shadows are needed to define the image.]]\n\nSunk or sunken relief is largely restricted to the [[art of Ancient Egypt]] where it is very common, becoming after the [[Amarna period]] of [[Ahkenaten]] the dominant type used, as opposed to low relief. It had been used earlier, but mainly for large reliefs on external walls, and for [[hieroglyph]]s and [[cartouche]]s. The image is made by cutting the relief sculpture itself into a flat surface. In a simpler form the images are usually mostly linear in nature, like hieroglyphs, but in most cases the figure itself is in low relief, but set within a sunken area shaped round the image, so that the relief never rises beyond the original flat surface. In some cases the figures and other elements are in a very low relief that does not rise to the original surface, but others are modeled more fully, with some areas rising to the original surface. This method minimizes the work removing the background, while allowing normal relief modelling.\n\nThe technique is most successful with strong sunlight to emphasise the outlines and forms by shadow, as no attempt was made to soften the edge of the sunk area, leaving a face at a right-angle to the surface all around it. Some reliefs, especially funerary monuments with heads or busts from ancient Rome and later Western art, leave a \"frame\" at the original level around the edge of the relief, or place a head in a hemispherical recess in the block (see Roman example in gallery). Though essentially very similar to Egyptian sunk relief, but with a background space at the lower level around the figure, the term would not normally be used of such works.\n\nIt is also used for carving letters (typically ''[[om mani padme hum]]'') in the [[mani stone]]s of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].\n\n===Counter-relief===\nSunk relief technique is not to be confused with \"counter-relief\" or intaglio as seen on [[engraved gem]] [[Seal (emblem)|seals]]\u2014where an image is fully modeled in a \"negative\" manner. The image goes into the surface, so that when impressed on wax it gives an impression in normal relief. However many engraved gems were carved in [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] or normal relief.\n\nA few very late [[Hellenistic]] monumental carvings in Egypt use full \"negative\" modelling as though on a gem seal, perhaps as sculptors trained in the Greek tradition attempted to use traditional Egyptian conventions.<ref>Barasch, Moshe, ''Visual Syncretism: A Case Study'', pp.&nbsp;39\u201343 in Budick, Stanford & Iser, Wolfgang, eds., ''The Translatability of cultures: figurations of the space between'', [[Stanford University Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|0-8047-2561-6}} ({{ISBN|978-0-8047-2561-3}}).</ref>\n\n===Small objects===\n[[File:French - Diptych with Scenes from the Passion of Christ - Walters 71179 - Open.jpg|thumb|left|French Gothic [[diptych]], 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in) high, with crowded scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', c.&nbsp;1350\u20131365]]\nSmall-scale reliefs have been carved in various materials, notably [[ivory carving|ivory]], wood, and wax.  Reliefs are often found in [[decorative arts]] such as [[ceramic art|ceramics]] and [[metalwork]]; these are less often described as \"reliefs\" than as \"in relief\". Small bronze reliefs are often in the form of \"plaques\" or [[plaquette]]s, which may be set in furniture or framed, or just kept as they are, a popular form for European collectors, especially in the Renaissance.\n\nVarious modelling techniques are used, such [[repouss\u00e9]] (\"pushed-back\") in metalwork, where a thin metal plate is shaped from behind using various metal or wood punches, producing a relief image. [[Casting]] has also been widely used in [[bronze]] and other metals. Casting and repouss\u00e9 are often used in concert in to speed up production and add greater detail to the final relief. In stone, as well as engraved gems, larger [[hardstone carving]]s in semi-precious stones have been highly prestigious since ancient times in many Eurasian cultures. Reliefs in [[wax]] were produced at least from the [[Renaissance]].\n\n[[Ivory carving|Carved ivory]] reliefs have been used since ancient times, and because the material, though expensive, cannot usually be reused, they have a relatively high survival rate, and for example [[consular diptych]]s represent a large proportion of the survivals of portable secular art from [[Late Antiquity]]. In the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] the carving of ivory reliefs became a considerable [[Luxury goods|luxury]] industry in [[Paris]] and other centres. As well as small [[diptych]]s and [[triptych]]s with densely packed religious scenes, usually from the [[New Testament]], secular objects, usually in a lower relief, were also produced.\n\nThese were often round mirror-cases, combs, handles, and other small items, but included a few larger caskets like the [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in the United States. Originally they were very often painted in bright colours.  Reliefs can be impressed by stamps onto clay, or the clay pressed into a mould bearing the design, as was usual with the mass-produced {{lang|la|[[terra sigillata]]}} of [[Ancient Roman pottery]]. Decorative reliefs in [[plaster]] or [[stucco]] may be much larger; this form of architectural decoration is found in many styles of interiors in the post-Renaissance West, and in [[Islamic architecture]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\n<!-- BIG ENOUGH - no more additions please - take it to talk -->\nFile:G\u00f6bekli Tepe reliefs of animals.jpg|Low relief from the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] archaeological site of [[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]], believed to represent a [[bull]], a [[fox]], and a [[Crane (bird)|crane]], c. 9,000 BC\nFile:Warka_vase_(background_retouched).jpg|The [[Warka Vase]] of [[Sumer]], a very early survival works of narrative relief, c. 3200\u20133000 BC.

It was shot in [[Cadaques]], [[Empuriabrava]] ([[Girona]]), [[Ebro Delta|Delta del Ebro]] ([[Tarragona]]) and [[Barcelona]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn a city on Spain's [[Costa Brava]], Clara Valverde, a beautiful young woman, lives with her husband Juan. They seem to have a perfect marriage. Juan is an architect and has planned a daring urbanistic project. In reality, the project is not viable. Clara, to keep her marriage and finances afloat, works as a porno actress in an underground film industry. In spite of her job and her marriage, Clara is still a virgin. Her marriage has never been consummated because her husband is impotent for which she blames herself. In her work she does not allow to be penetrated. One day she goes to a meeting with Kellerman, an American millionaire who seems to be interested in bringing Juan's project into fruition. However, Clara soon learns that what he really wants is to blackmail her. The owner of the house, Jorge, finds out Claras's real occupation and threatens to tell the truth to her husband if she does not have sex with the American.\n\nClara is brutally raped by Kellerman. She then finds out that not only her husband is not impotent as she had thought, he has had sex with other women including Clara's friend.

They seem to have a perfect marriage. Juan is an architect and has planned a daring urbanistic project. In reality, the project is not viable. Clara, to keep her marriage and finances afloat, works as a porno actress in an underground film industry. In spite of her job and her marriage, Clara is still a virgin. Her marriage has never been consummated because her husband is impotent for which she blames herself. In her work she does not allow to be penetrated. One day she goes to a meeting with Kellerman, an American millionaire who seems to be interested in bringing Juan\u2019s project into fruition. However, Clara soon learns that what he really wants is to blackmail her. The owner of the house, Jorge, finds out Claras\u2019s real occupation and threatens to tell the truth to her husband if she does not have sex with the American.\n\nClara is brutally raped by Kellerman. She then finds out that not only her husband is not impotent as she had thought, he has had sex with other women including Clara\u2019s friend. Juan also has a homosexual relationship with Miguel, the director of the pornographic films. She finally realizes that she has been only a coin exchanged in the hands of the men around her.

The original musical score was composed by [[Pino Donaggio]].\n\nThe film was a direct homage to the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], specifically ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954) taking plot lines and themes (such as [[voyeurism]] and obsession) from the first two films.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams |first=Linda |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6pL0AUb5BHUC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema|page=86|year=2005|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ann |last=Cvetkovich |chapter-url=http://english.illinoisstate.edu/strickland/rsvtxt/cvetko.htm |chapter=Postmodern Vertigo: The Sexual Politics of Allusion in De Palma's Body Double |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211060858/http://english.illinoisstate.edu/strickland/rsvtxt/cvetko.htm |archivedate=February 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |editor-last1=Raubicheck |editor-first1=Walter |editor-first2=Walter |editor-last2=Srebnick |title=Hitchcock's Rereleased Films: From Rope to Vertigo |location=Detroit |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nThe film received a lukewarm result at the box office and mixed reviews, but has subsequently become a [[cult film]]. When [[Twilight Time (DVD label)|Twilight Time]] released the film on Blu-ray in the United States in 2013, it quickly sold out.<ref>https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/61564/body-double-blu-ray/</ref><ref>http://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/body-double-blu-ray-review.325785/</ref><ref>http://www.rupertpupkinspeaks.com/2013/08/twilight-timey-body-double-on-blu-ray.html</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJake Scully ([[Craig Wasson]]) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a [[vampire]] in a low-budget [[horror film|horror movie]] after his [[claustrophobia]] thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend ([[Barbara Crampton]]) cheating on him, he splits and is left without a place to stay (the residence belongs to her). At a [[method acting]] class, he meets Sam Bouchard ([[Gregg Henry]]) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's rich friend has gone on a trip to Europe and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the [[Hollywood Hills]].\n\nDuring the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially enthusiastic about showing Scully one feature: a [[telescope]], and through it a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle ([[Deborah Shelton]]), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Scully voyeuristically watches Gloria each night until he sees her being abused by a man she appears to know. The next day he follows her when she goes shopping. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \"Indian\", a man he had noticed was watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside [[motel]] where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully pursues him into a nearby tunnel but is overcome by his claustrophobia. Gloria walks him out of it. They impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns and breaks into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld [[drill]].\n\n[[File:John Lautner's Chemosphere (8189866290).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chemosphere]], the ultramodern house used in ''Body Double'']]\nScully alerts the police, who determine it was a botched robbery. However, Detective McLean ([[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]]) becomes suspicious after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in Scully's pocket. Although McLean does not arrest him, he tells Scully that his voyeuristic behavior, as well as not alerting the police sooner, helped cause Gloria's murder. Unable to sleep, Scully watches a pornography TV channel. He observes that the actress, Holly Body ([[Melanie Griffith]]), dances in exactly the same sensual manner that Gloria did. To meet Holly, he pretends to be a porn producer hiring for a new film.\n\nScully learns from Holly that Sam hired her to impersonate Gloria each night, dancing in the window, knowing Scully would be watching and later witness the real Gloria's murder. Offended at the suggestion she was involved in a killing, Holly storms out of the house. She is picked up by the Indian who knocks her unconscious and drives her away. Scully follows them to an aqueduct where the Indian is digging a grave. During their fight, Scully discovers the Indian is Sam in heavy make-up. Scully was a scapegoat providing Sam, who was Gloria's abusive husband, with an alibi during the murder. Scully is overpowered and thrown into the grave and is incapacitated by his claustrophobia. However, he overcomes his fear and climbs out as Sam is knocked into the aqueduct and drowned.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Scully is shown having been recast in his previous vampire role as Holly watches from the sidelines.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Craig Wasson]] as Jake Scully\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Sam Bouchard\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Holly Body\n* [[Deborah Shelton]] as Gloria Revelle\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Detective Jim McLean\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Rubin\n* [[David Haskell]] as Will\n* [[Al Israel]] as Corso\n* [[Douglas Warhit]] as Video Salesman\n* B.J.

Avrech later said \"Both Brian and I were, and are, huge fans of Alfred Hitchcock's movies.

After returning home to discover his girlfriend ([[Barbara Crampton]]) cheating on him, he splits and is left without a place to stay (the residence belongs to her). At a [[method acting]] class, he meets Sam Bouchard ([[Gregg Henry]]) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's rich friend has gone on a trip to Europe and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the [[Hollywood Hills]].\n\nDuring the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially enthusiastic about showing Scully one feature: a [[telescope]], and through it a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle ([[Deborah Shelton]]), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Scully voyeuristically watches Gloria each night until he sees her being abused by a man she appears to know. The next day he follows her when she goes shopping. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \"Indian\", a man he had noticed was watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside [[motel]] where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully pursues him into a nearby tunnel but is overcome by his claustrophobia. Gloria walks him out of it. They impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns and breaks into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld [[drill]].\n\n[[File:John Lautner's Chemosphere (8189866290).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chemosphere]], the ultramodern house used in ''Body Double'']]\nScully alerts the police, who determine it was a botched robbery. However, Detective McLean ([[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]]) becomes suspicious after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in Scully's pocket. Although McLean does not arrest him, he tells Scully that his voyeuristic behavior, as well as not alerting the police sooner, helped cause Gloria's murder. Unable to sleep, Scully watches a pornography TV channel. He observes that the actress, Holly Body ([[Melanie Griffith]]), dances in exactly the same sensual manner that Gloria did. To meet Holly, he pretends to be a porn producer hiring for a new film.\n\nScully learns from Holly that Sam hired her to impersonate Gloria each night, dancing in the window, knowing Scully would be watching and later witness the real Gloria's murder. Offended at the suggestion she was involved in a killing, Holly storms out of the house. She is picked up by the Indian who knocks her unconscious and drives her away. Scully follows them to an aqueduct where the Indian is digging a grave. During their fight, Scully discovers the Indian is Sam in heavy make-up. Scully was a scapegoat providing Sam, who was Gloria's abusive husband, with an alibi during the murder. Scully is overpowered and thrown into the grave and is incapacitated by his claustrophobia. However, he overcomes his fear and climbs out as Sam is knocked into the aqueduct and drowned.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Scully is shown having been recast in his previous vampire role as Holly watches from the sidelines.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Craig Wasson]] as Jake Scully\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Sam Bouchard\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Holly Body\n* [[Deborah Shelton]] as Gloria Revelle\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Detective Jim McLean\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Rubin\n* [[David Haskell]] as Will\n* [[Al Israel]] as Corso\n* [[Douglas Warhit]] as Video Salesman\n* B.J.

Much of his early childhood was spent in [[Vicenza]], where his family relocated when he was 2 years old. After his mother's death when he was 13, he moved with his father and brother back to Venice. Carlo attended the Academy of Fine Arts where he focused on architectural studies. Graduated from the Accademia in Venice, with the title of Professor of Architecture, he apprenticed with the architect Francesco Rinaldo. Scarpa married Rinaldo's niece, Nini Lazzari (Onorina Lazzari).\n\nHowever, Scarpa refused to sit the ''pro forma'' professional exam administrated by the Italian Government after [[World War II]]. As a consequence, he was not permitted to practice architecture without associating with an architect. Hence, those who worked with him, his clients, associates, craftspersons, called him \"Professor\", rather than \"architect\".\n\nHis architecture is deeply sensitive to the changes of time, from seasons to history, rooted in a sensuous material imagination. He was [[Mario Botta]]'s thesis adviser along with Giuseppe Mazzariol; the latter was the Director of the [[Fondazione Querini Stampalia]] when Scarpa completed his renovation and garden for that institution. Scarpa taught drawing and Interior Decoration at the \"Istituto universitario di architettura di Venezia\" from the late 1940s until his death. While most of his built work is located in the [[Veneto]], he made designs of landscapes, gardens, and buildings, for other regions of Italy as well as Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, France and Switzerland. His name has 11 letters and this is used repeatedly in his architecture.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Frascari, Marco |title=Architectural Traces of an Admirable Cipher: Eleven in the Opus of Carlo Scarpa|journal=Nexus Network Journal|date=June 1999|volume =1|issue =1\u20132|pages=7\u201322|doi=10.1007/s00004-998-0002-4 }}</ref>\n\nOne of his last projects, the Villa Palazzetto in [[Monselice]], left incomplete at the time of his death, was altered in October 2006 by his son [[Afra and Tobia Scarpa|Tobia]]. This work is one of Scarpa's most ambitious landscape and garden projects, the [[Brion Cemetery|Brion Sanctuary]] notwithstanding. It was executed for Aldo Businaro, the representative for Cassina who is responsible for Scarpa's first trip to Japan. Aldo Businaro died in August 2006, a few months before the completion of the new stair at the Villa Palazzetto, built to commemorate Scarpa's centenary.\n\nIn 1978, while in [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai, Japan]], Scarpa died after falling down a flight of concrete stairs. He survived for ten days in a hospital before succumbing to the injuries of his fall. He is buried standing up and wrapped in linen sheets in the style of a medieval knight, in an isolated exterior corner of his L-shaped Brion Cemetery at San Vito d'Altivole in the Veneto.\n\nIn 1984, the Italian composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]] dedicated to him the composition for orchestra in micro-intervals ''A Carlo Scarpa, Architetto, Ai suoi infiniti possibili''.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Carlo Scarpa, architetto, ai suoi infiniti possibili |url=http://www.luiginono.it/en/works/a-carlo-scarpa-architetto-ai-suoi-infiniti-possibili/ |website=Archivio Luigi Nono (Luigi Nono Archive) |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notable works==\n*[[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], Venice, Italy<ref>Scarpa carried out \"sensitive restoration work\" on the building.{{cite web| url = http://www.understandingitaly.com/people/scarpa.html\n| title = Carlo Scarpa, Architect| accessdate = January 17, 2017| publisher = understandingitaly.com}}</ref>\n* Padiglione del libro d'arte, Giardini di Castello, [[La Biennale]], [[Venice]], 1950 - 1952  <ref>{{cite web|last1=Museo Nazionale della Arti Dell XXI Secolo|title=Collezioni XX secolo torna indietro Padiglione del libro d'arte, Giardini di Castello|url=http://maxxisearch.fondazionemaxxi.it/maxxi/collezionixx/XX/scheda/IT-MAXXI-AR0001-0001839|website=MAXXI|date=1950|access-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928152431/http://maxxisearch.fondazionemaxxi.it/maxxi/collezionixx/XX/scheda/IT-MAXXI-AR0001-0001839#|archive-date=28 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* Palazzo Abatellis: La Galleria Di Sicilia, Palermo, 1953-54 <ref>{{cite web|last1=Polano|first1=Sergio|title=Carlo Scarpa: Palazzo Abatellis : La Galleria della Sicilia, Palermo 1953-54|url=http://www.electaweb.it/catalogo/scheda/978884355733/en?language=en_EN|publisher=Milan : Mondadori Electa|date=1989}}</ref>\n*[[Ca' Foscari|''Palazzo Ca'Foscari'']], [[Venice]], Italy 1935 \u2013 1956\n* Venezuelan Pavilion (1954\u201356), [[La Biennale]], Venice, Italy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scarpa|first1=Carlo|title=Venezuelan Pavilion (1954-56), Venice Architecture Biennale 2014|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/index.html|website=La Biennale|access-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921060223/http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/index.html#|archive-date=21 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* Veritti House, Udine, Italy, 1955 - 1961 <ref>{{cite web |last1=Olsberg |first1=Nicholas |last2=Ranalli |first2=George |last3=Bedard|first3=Jean-Francios|last4=Polano|first4=Sergio|last5=Di Lieto|first5=Alba|last6=Friedman|first6=Mildred|title=Carlo Scarpa, architect : Intervening With History|url=http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=GRI&afterPDS=true&institution=01GRI&docId=GETTY_ALMA21136913130001551|website=Getty Search Gateway|publisher=Montreal, Quebec, Canada : Canadian Centre For Architecture New York : Monacelli Press|date=1999}}</ref>\n* Museo Canova di Possagno, Italy, 1955 - 1957 <ref>{{cite web|title=L'ampliamento di Scarpa al Museo di Possagno|url=http://www.museocanova.it/index.php?lang=en|website=Museo Canova}}</ref>\n*[[Castelvecchio Museum|''Museo di Castelvecchio'']], [[Verona]], Italy, 1956 \u2013 1964 <ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Richard|title=Carlo Scarpa and the Castelvecchio|url=http://primo.getty.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=GRI&afterPDS=true&institution=01GRI&docId=GETTY_ALMA21131832910001551|publisher=London ; Boston : Butterworth Architecture, 1990.|date=1990}}</ref>\n* Negozio [[Olivetti]], piazza S.

Published in 2017, ''Pachinko'' is an epic historical novel following a Korean family who eventually migrates to Japan, it is the first novel written for an adult, English-speaking audience about Japanese\u2013Korean culture.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The character-driven tale features a large ensemble of characters who become subjected to issues of racism and stereotypes, among other events with historical origins in the 20th-century Korean experiences with Japan.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Fiction reviews |year= 2016 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |issue= 263 |page= 47|id = {{ProQuest|1859879603}}}}</ref>\n\n''Pachinko'' was a 2017 finalist for the [[National Book Award for Fiction|National Book Award for fiction]]. [[Apple Inc.]]'s streaming service [[Apple TV+]] has purchased the rights for a television adaptation of the novel.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1883, in the little island fishing village of [[Yeongdo]], which is a ferry ride from Busan, an aging fisherman and his wife take in lodgers to make a little more money. They have three sons, but only one, Hoonie, with a cleft lip and twisted foot, survives to adulthood. Because of his deformities, Hoonie is considered ineligible for marriage. When he is 27, [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910|Japan annexes Korea]] and many families are left destitute and lacking food. Due to their prudent habits, Hoonie's family's situation is comparatively more stable, and a matchmaker arranges a marriage between Hoonie and Yangjin, the daughter of a poor farmer who had lost everything in the colonized land. Hoonie and Yangjin eventually take over the lodging house.\n\nIn the mid 1910s, Yangjin and Hoonie have a daughter named Sunja. After her thirteenth birthday, she is raised solely by her mother Yangjin, her father Hoonie dying from tuberculosis. When Sunja is sixteen, she is pursued by a wealthy fishbroker, Koh Hansu. Sunja becomes pregnant, after which Hansu reveals that he is already married but intends to keep her as his mistress. Ashamed, Sunja reveals the truth to her mother, who eventually confesses it to one of their lodgers, a Christian minister suffering from tuberculosis. Baek Isak, the minister, believes he will die soon due to his many illnesses, and decides to marry Sunja to give her child a name and to give meaning to his life. Sunja agrees to the plan and marries Isak, traveling with him to [[Osaka]] to live with Isak's brother and his wife. In Osaka, Sunja is shocked to learn that Koreans are treated poorly and are forced to live in a small ghetto and are only hired for menial jobs. Sunja's brother-in-law, Yoseb, insists on supporting the entire household on his own salary, but Sunja and her sister-in-law Kyunghee come to learn he is in heavy debt due to paying for Sunja and Isak's passage to Osaka. To pay for the cost, Sunja sells a watch given to her by Hansu.\n\nAs time goes on, Sunja gives birth to her son Noa and then to a second son she conceives with Isak, Mozasu. While Noa physically resembles Hansu, he is similar in personality to Isak, and seeks a quiet life of learning, reading and academia. Shortly after Mozasu is born, Isak is taken prisoner when a member of his church is caught reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]] when they were supposed to be worshiping the emperor. Despite Yoseb's resistance, Sunja begins to work in the market, selling [[kimchi]] that she and Kyunghee make. Their small business goes well, but as Japan enters the [[Second World War]] and ingredients grow scarce, they struggle to make money. Sunja is eventually approached by the owner of a restaurant, Kim Changho, who pays her and Kyunghee to make kimchi in his restaurant, providing them with financial security. A dying Isak is eventually released from prison, and he is able to briefly reunite with his family. \n\nA few years later, on the eve of the restaurant's closure, Sunja is approached by Hansu, who reveals that he is the actual owner of the restaurant and has been manipulating her family for years, having tracked Sunja down after she sold her watch. He arranges for her to spend the rest of the war in the countryside with Kyunghee and her children, and for Yoseb to wait the rest of the war out working at a factory in [[Nagasaki]]. During her time at the farm, Hansu also reunites Sunja with her mother, Yangjin, and eventually returns a permanently crippled Yoseb to the family after he is horrifically burned during the bombings. \n\nThe Baek family eventually return to Osaka where Noa and Mozasu resume their studies. The family continues to struggle in spite of Hansu's help. Though they long to return to the North of Korea, where Kyunghee has family, Hansu warns them not to. Noa succeeds in passing the entrance exams for [[Waseda University]]. Despite Sunja's resistance, Hansu pays for Noa's entire university education, pretending it is simply because as an older Korean man he feels responsible for helping the younger generation. Meanwhile, Mozasu drops out of school and goes to work for Goro, a man who runs [[Pachinko]] parlors. Mozasu eventually meets and falls in love with a Korean seamstress, Yumi, who dreams of moving to America. The two marry and have a son, Solomon. Yumi later dies in a car accident, leaving Mozasu to raise their son on his own.\n\nNoa, who has continued his studies and looks up to Hansu as a mentor, accidentally discovers he is his father and learns of his ties to the [[yakuza]]. Ashamed of his true heritage and being linked to corrupt blood, he drops out of university and moves to [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]], intending to work off his debt to Hansu and rid himself of his shameful heritage. He becomes a bookkeeper for a racist Pachinko owner who won't hire Koreans and lives undercover using his Japanese name, Nobuo, eventually marrying a Japanese woman and having four children. After having abandoned his family and living sixteen years under a false identity, Noa is tracked down by Hansu at the request of Sunja. Though Hansu warns Sunja not to immediately approach Noa, Sunja refuses to listen to his warnings and begs Noa to reunite with her and the rest of the family. After promising to do so, he commits suicide. \n\nIn the meantime, Mozasu has become an extremely wealthy man, owning his own Pachinko parlors and taking on a Japanese girlfriend, Etsuko, who refuses to marry him. Hana, Etsuko's troubled teenage daughter from her previous marriage, arrives to stay with the family after learning she is pregnant, later having an abortion. Hana is drawn to Solomon's innocence and they begin a sexual relationship; he quickly falls in love with her, giving her large sums of money when asked, which she uses to run away to [[Tokyo]].\n\nYears later, Solomon, now attending college in [[New York City|New York]] and dating a Korean-American woman named Phoebe, receives a call from a drunken Hana in [[Roppongi]]. He relays the information to Etsuko and Mozasu, who manage to locate her. After graduating college, Solomon takes a job at a British bank and moves back to Japan with Phoebe. His first major client project involves convincing an elderly Korean woman to sell her land in order to clear way for the construction of a golf resort, which he accomplishes by calling in a favor from his father's friend Goro. When the woman dies of natural causes soon after, Solomon's employers claim the deal will attract negative publicity and fire him, citing his father's connections to Pachinko and implying that the woman was murdered by a [[contract killing|hit]].\n\nWith newfound resolve and a clearer outlook on life, Solomon breaks up with Phoebe, goes to work for his father's business, and makes amends with a dying Hana in the hospital. Now an elderly woman, Sunja visits Isak's grave and reflects on her life. She finds out from the cemetery groundskeeper that despite the shame Noa felt for his family, Noa had been visiting Isak's grave longer after Noa ceased contact with his family and started a new life in Japan. This gives Sunja the closure and reassurance she needs, and she buries a photo of Noa beside Isak's grave.\n\nPachinko takes place over the course of three books: Book I Gohyang/Hometown, Book II Motherland, and Book III Pachinko.\u00a0Book I begins with the story of Sunja's father, Hoonie and ends with Noa's birth.\u00a0Book II begins with Baek Isak's incarceration and ends with Sunja's search of Koh Hansu. Book III begins with Noa's new beginnings in Nagano and ends with Sunja's reflections upon everything that has happened to her.\n\n== Characters ==\n'''Hoonie''' \u2014 Hoonie is the first character to be introduced in the story, born with a twisted foot a [[cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]].<ref>Lee, Min Jin.

''Pachinko''. Grand Central Publishing, 2017, pp. 30.</ref>\u00a0This is a recurring theme throughout the book, especially present in the treatment of Koreans in Japanese schools, such as Mozasu's experiences with [[bullying]].\n\nPower is another main theme.\u00a0Koh Hansu is the main exhibitor of power, using his influence to directly affect Sunja's life throughout the novel. Through this power, Sunja's family is able to survive and thrive while other Koreans around them struggle to support themselves, living in the same neighborhood but in much worse conditions.\u00a0Through Hansu's influence, Sunja was deeply moved, but also conflictingly aggravated, as she thought she had successfully rid her life of Koh Hansu.\n\nPachinko is one of the themes directly addressed in the novel.\u00a0Many times, the novel states that Koreans in Japan are often associated with the pachinko business.\u00a0Lee has said that the novel's title, which was originally set to be ''Motherland'', was changed to ''Pachinko'' when, in her interviews, Koreans seemed to relate back to the pachinko business.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite magazine |last= Morgan |first= Adam |url=

and [[World War II]].\u00a0As an historical novel, these events play a central role in ''Pachinko'', influencing the characters' decisions like Sunja's moving to Japan.\n\nIn an interview with Min Jin Lee, she references that the history of Korean-Japanese relationships are one of the most obvious displays of issues surrounding racism and exclusion outside the norms of the west.<ref name=\":0\"

Published in 2017, ''Pachinko'' is an epic historical novel following a Korean family who eventually migrates to Japan, it is the first novel written for an adult, English-speaking audience about Japanese\u2013Korean culture.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The character-driven tale features a large ensemble of characters who become subjected to issues of racism and stereotypes, among other events with historical origins in the 20th-century Korean experiences with Japan.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Fiction reviews |year= 2016 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |issue= 263 |page= 47|id = {{ProQuest|1859879603}}}}</ref>\n\n''Pachinko'' was a 2017 finalist for the [[National Book Award for Fiction|National Book Award for fiction]]. [[Apple Inc.]]'s streaming service [[Apple TV+]] has purchased the rights for a television adaptation of the novel.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1883, in the little island fishing village of [[Yeongdo]], which is a ferry ride from Busan, an aging fisherman and his wife take in lodgers to make a little more money. They have three sons, but only one, Hoonie, with a cleft lip and twisted foot, survives to adulthood. Because of his deformities, Hoonie is considered ineligible for marriage. When he is 27, [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910|Japan annexes Korea]] and many families are left destitute and lacking food. Due to their prudent habits, Hoonie's family's situation is comparatively more stable, and a matchmaker arranges a marriage between Hoonie and Yangjin, the daughter of a poor farmer who had lost everything in the colonized land. Hoonie and Yangjin eventually take over the lodging house.\n\nIn the mid 1910s, Yangjin and Hoonie have a daughter named Sunja. After her thirteenth birthday, she is raised solely by her mother Yangjin, her father Hoonie dying from tuberculosis. When Sunja is sixteen, she is pursued by a wealthy fishbroker, Koh Hansu. Sunja becomes pregnant, after which Hansu reveals that he is already married but intends to keep her as his mistress. Ashamed, Sunja reveals the truth to her mother, who eventually confesses it to one of their lodgers, a Christian minister suffering from tuberculosis. Baek Isak, the minister, believes he will die soon due to his many illnesses, and decides to marry Sunja to give her child a name and to give meaning to his life. Sunja agrees to the plan and marries Isak, traveling with him to [[Osaka]] to live with Isak's brother and his wife. In Osaka, Sunja is shocked to learn that Koreans are treated poorly and are forced to live in a small ghetto and are only hired for menial jobs. Sunja's brother-in-law, Yoseb, insists on supporting the entire household on his own salary, but Sunja and her sister-in-law Kyunghee come to learn he is in heavy debt due to paying for Sunja and Isak's passage to Osaka. To pay for the cost, Sunja sells a watch given to her by Hansu.\n\nAs time goes on, Sunja gives birth to her son Noa and then to a second son she conceives with Isak, Mozasu. While Noa physically resembles Hansu, he is similar in personality to Isak, and seeks a quiet life of learning, reading and academia. Shortly after Mozasu is born, Isak is taken prisoner when a member of his church is caught reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]] when they were supposed to be worshiping the emperor. Despite Yoseb's resistance, Sunja begins to work in the market, selling [[kimchi]] that she and Kyunghee make. Their small business goes well, but as Japan enters the [[Second World War]] and ingredients grow scarce, they struggle to make money. Sunja is eventually approached by the owner of a restaurant, Kim Changho, who pays her and Kyunghee to make kimchi in his restaurant, providing them with financial security. A dying Isak is eventually released from prison, and he is able to briefly reunite with his family. \n\nA few years later, on the eve of the restaurant's closure, Sunja is approached by Hansu, who reveals that he is the actual owner of the restaurant and has been manipulating her family for years, having tracked Sunja down after she sold her watch. He arranges for her to spend the rest of the war in the countryside with Kyunghee and her children, and for Yoseb to wait the rest of the war out working at a factory in [[Nagasaki]]. During her time at the farm, Hansu also reunites Sunja with her mother, Yangjin, and eventually returns a permanently crippled Yoseb to the family after he is horrifically burned during the bombings. \n\nThe Baek family eventually return to Osaka where Noa and Mozasu resume their studies. The family continues to struggle in spite of Hansu's help. Though they long to return to the North of Korea, where Kyunghee has family, Hansu warns them not to. Noa succeeds in passing the entrance exams for [[Waseda University]]. Despite Sunja's resistance, Hansu pays for Noa's entire university education, pretending it is simply because as an older Korean man he feels responsible for helping the younger generation. Meanwhile, Mozasu drops out of school and goes to work for Goro, a man who runs [[Pachinko]] parlors. Mozasu eventually meets and falls in love with a Korean seamstress, Yumi, who dreams of moving to America. The two marry and have a son, Solomon. Yumi later dies in a car accident, leaving Mozasu to raise their son on his own.\n\nNoa, who has continued his studies and looks up to Hansu as a mentor, accidentally discovers he is his father and learns of his ties to the [[yakuza]]. Ashamed of his true heritage and being linked to corrupt blood, he drops out of university and moves to [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]], intending to work off his debt to Hansu and rid himself of his shameful heritage. He becomes a bookkeeper for a racist Pachinko owner who won't hire Koreans and lives undercover using his Japanese name, Nobuo, eventually marrying a Japanese woman and having four children. After having abandoned his family and living sixteen years under a false identity, Noa is tracked down by Hansu at the request of Sunja. Though Hansu warns Sunja not to immediately approach Noa, Sunja refuses to listen to his warnings and begs Noa to reunite with her and the rest of the family. After promising to do so, he commits suicide. \n\nIn the meantime, Mozasu has become an extremely wealthy man, owning his own Pachinko parlors and taking on a Japanese girlfriend, Etsuko, who refuses to marry him. Hana, Etsuko's troubled teenage daughter from her previous marriage, arrives to stay with the family after learning she is pregnant, later having an abortion. Hana is drawn to Solomon's innocence and they begin a sexual relationship; he quickly falls in love with her, giving her large sums of money when asked, which she uses to run away to [[Tokyo]].\n\nYears later, Solomon, now attending college in [[New York City|New York]] and dating a Korean-American woman named Phoebe, receives a call from a drunken Hana in [[Roppongi]]. He relays the information to Etsuko and Mozasu, who manage to locate her. After graduating college, Solomon takes a job at a British bank and moves back to Japan with Phoebe. His first major client project involves convincing an elderly Korean woman to sell her land in order to clear way for the construction of a golf resort, which he accomplishes by calling in a favor from his father's friend Goro. When the woman dies of natural causes soon after, Solomon's employers claim the deal will attract negative publicity and fire him, citing his father's connections to Pachinko and implying that the woman was murdered by a [[contract killing|hit]].\n\nWith newfound resolve and a clearer outlook on life, Solomon breaks up with Phoebe, goes to work for his father's business, and makes amends with a dying Hana in the hospital. Now an elderly woman, Sunja visits Isak's grave and reflects on her life. She finds out from the cemetery groundskeeper that despite the shame Noa felt for his family, Noa had been visiting Isak's grave longer after Noa ceased contact with his family and started a new life in Japan. This gives Sunja the closure and reassurance she needs, and she buries a photo of Noa beside Isak's grave.\n\nPachinko takes place over the course of three books: Book I Gohyang/Hometown, Book II Motherland, and Book III Pachinko.\u00a0Book I begins with the story of Sunja's father, Hoonie and ends with Noa's birth.\u00a0Book II begins with Baek Isak's incarceration and ends with Sunja's search of Koh Hansu. Book III begins with Noa's new beginnings in Nagano and ends with Sunja's reflections upon everything that has happened to her.\n\n== Characters ==\n'''Hoonie''' \u2014 Hoonie is the first character to be introduced in the story, born with a twisted foot a [[cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]].<ref>Lee, Min Jin.

''Pachinko''. Grand Central Publishing, 2017, pp. 30.</ref>\u00a0This is a recurring theme throughout the book, especially present in the treatment of Koreans in Japanese schools, such as Mozasu\u2019s experiences with [[bullying]].\n\nPower is another main theme.\u00a0Koh Hansu is the main exhibitor of power, using his influence to directly affect Sunja\u2019s life throughout the novel. Through this power, Sunja\u2019s family is able to survive and thrive while other Koreans around them struggle to support themselves, living in the same neighborhood but in much worse conditions.\u00a0Through Hansu's influence, Sunja was deeply moved, but also conflictingly aggravated, as she thought she had successfully rid her life of Koh Hansu.\n\nPachinko is one of the themes directly addressed in the novel.\u00a0Many times, the novel states that Koreans in Japan are often associated with the pachinko business.\u00a0Lee has said that the novel's title, which was originally set to be ''Motherland'', was changed to ''Pachinko'' when, in her interviews, Koreans seemed to relate back to the pachinko business.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite magazine |last= Morgan |first= Adam |url=

and [[World War II]].\u00a0As an historical novel, these events play a central role in ''Pachinko'', influencing the characters' decisions like Sunja\u2019s moving to Japan.\n\nIn an interview with Min Jin Lee, she references that the history of Korean-Japanese relationships are one of the most obvious displays of issues surrounding racism and exclusion outside the norms of the west.<ref
