It consists mostly of [[organic compound]]s obtained by the [[fractional distillation]] of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of [[gasoline additive|additives]]. On average, a {{convert|42|gal|liter|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Oil barrel|barrel]] of  [[Petroleum|crude oil]] yields about {{convert|19|gal|liter|abbr=off}} of gasoline (among other refined products) after processing in an [[oil refinery]], though this varies based on the [[crude oil assay]].\n\nThe characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes [[engine knocking|knocking]] and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its [[octane rating]] which is produced in several grades. [[Tetraethyl lead]] and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to increase octane rating (still used in aviation and auto-racing). Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system cleaning. Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as [[ethanol]], [[MTBE]] or [[ETBE]] to improve combustion.\n\nGasoline used in internal combustion engines can have significant effects on the local environment, and is also a contributor to global human carbon dioxide emissions. Gasoline can also enter the environment uncombusted, both as liquid and as vapor, from leakage and handling during production, transport and delivery (e.g., from storage tanks, from spills, etc.). As an example of efforts to control such leakage, many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ust/preventing-and-detecting-underground-storage-tank-ust-releases|title=Preventing and Detecting Underground Storage Tank (UST) Releases |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |language=en|access-date=14 November 2018|date=13 October 2014 }}</ref> Gasoline contains [[benzene]] and other known [[carcinogen]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=36176#Download|title=Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Unleaded Gasoline|work=epa.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032708/http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=36176#Download|archivedate=27 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mehlman|first1=MA|title=Dangerous properties of petroleum-refining products: carcinogenicity of motor fuels (gasoline).|journal=Teratogenesis, Carcinogenesis, and Mutagenesis|date=1990|volume=10|issue=5|pages=399\u2013408|pmid=1981951|doi=10.1002/tcm.1770100505}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baumbach|first1=JI|last2=Sielemann|first2=S|last3=Xie|first3=Z|last4=Schmidt|first4=H|title=Detection of the gasoline components methyl tert-butyl ether, benzene, toluene, and m-xylene using ion mobility spectrometers with a radioactive and UV ionization source.|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=15 March 2003|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1483\u201390|pmid=12659213|doi=10.1021/ac020342i}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Gasoline\" is an English word that refers to fuel for [[automobile]]s.

The fuel for these early engines was a relatively volatile [[hydrocarbon]] obtained from [[coal gas]]. With a [[boiling point]] near {{convert|85|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[octane]] boils about 40&nbsp;\u00b0C higher), it was well-suited for early [[carburetor]]s (evaporators). The development of a \"spray nozzle\" carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels. Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher [[compression ratio]]s, but early attempts were blocked by the premature explosion of fuel, known as [[engine knocking|knocking]].\n\nIn 1891, the [[Shukhov cracking process]] became the world's first commercial method to break down heavier hydrocarbons in crude oil to increase the percentage of lighter products compared to simple distillation.\n\n===1903 to 1914===\n\nThe evolution of gasoline followed the evolution of oil as the dominant source of energy in the industrializing world. Prior to World War One, Britain was the world's greatest industrial power and depended on its navy to protect the shipping of raw materials from its colonies. Germany was also industrializing and, like Britain, lacked many natural resources which had to be shipped to the home country. By the 1890s, Germany began to pursue a policy of global prominence and began building a navy to compete with Britain's. Coal was the fuel that powered their navies. Though both Britain and Germany had natural coal reserves, new developments in oil as a fuel for ships changed the situation. Coal-powered ships were a tactical weakness because the process of [[coaling (ships)|loading coal]] was extremely slow and dirty and left the ship completely vulnerable to attack, and unreliable supplies of coal at international ports made long-distance voyages impractical. The advantages of petroleum oil soon found the navies of the world converting to oil, but Britain and Germany had very few domestic oil reserves.<ref>Daniel Yergen, ''The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 150\u201363.</ref> Britain eventually solved its naval oil dependence by securing oil from [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] and this determined from where and of what quality its gasoline would come.\n\nDuring the early period of gasoline engine development, aircraft were forced to use motor vehicle gasoline since aviation gasoline did not yet exist. These early fuels were termed \"straight-run\" gasolines and were byproducts from the distillation of a single crude oil to produce [[kerosene]], which was the principal product sought for burning in [[kerosene lamp]]s. Gasoline production would not surpass kerosene production until 1916. The earliest straight-run gasolines were the result of distilling eastern crude oils and there was no mixing of distillates from different crudes. The composition of these early fuels was unknown and the quality varied greatly as crude oils from different oil fields emerged in different mixtures of hydrocarbons in different ratios. The engine effects produced by abnormal combustion ([[engine knocking]] and [[pre-ignition]]) due to inferior fuels had not yet been identified, and as a result there was no rating of gasoline in terms of its resistance to abnormal combustion. The general specification by which early gasolines were measured was that of [[specific gravity]] via the [[Baum\u00e9 scale]] and later the [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] (tendency to vaporize) specified in terms of boiling points, which became the primary focuses for gasoline producers. These early eastern crude oil gasolines had relatively high Baum\u00e9 test results (65 to 80 degrees Baum\u00e9) and were called Pennsylvania \"High-Test\" or simply \"High-Test\" gasolines. These would often be used in aircraft engines.\n\nBy 1910, increased automobile production and the resultant increase in gasoline consumption produced a greater demand for gasoline. Also, the growing electrification of lighting produced a drop in kerosene demand, creating a supply problem. It appeared that the burgeoning oil industry would be trapped into over-producing kerosene and under-producing gasoline since simple distillation could not alter the ratio of the two products from any given crude. The solution appeared in 1911, when the development of the [[Burton process]] allowed [[thermal cracking]] of crude oils, which increased the percent yield of gasoline from the heavier hydrocarbons. This was combined with expansion of foreign markets for the export of surplus kerosene which domestic markets no longer needed. These new thermally \"cracked\" gasolines were believed to have no harmful effects and would be added to straight-run gasolines. There also was the practice of mixing heavy and light distillates to achieve a desired Baum\u00e9 reading and collectively these were called \"blended\" gasolines.<ref name=\"Matthew Van Winkle 1944, pp. 1\">Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nGradually, volatility gained favor over the Baum\u00e9 test, though both would continue to be used in combination to specify a gasoline. As late as June 1917, [[Standard Oil]] (the largest refiner of crude oil in the United States at the time) stated that the most important property of a gasoline was its volatility.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKo7AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA2 |title = Farm Implements|publisher = Farm Implement Publishing Company|year = 1917}}</ref> It is estimated that the rating equivalent of these straight-run gasolines varied from 40 to 60 octane and that the \"High-Test\", sometimes referred to as \"fighting grade\", probably averaged 50 to 65 octane.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nPrior to the [[American entry into World War I]], the European Allies used fuels derived from crude oils from Borneo, Java and Sumatra, which gave satisfactory performance in their military aircraft. When the United States entered the war in April 1917, the U.S. became the principal supplier of aviation gasoline to the Allies and a decrease in engine performance was noted.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lo9TAAAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PA575 |page=569 |title=Development of Aircraft Engines: Two Studies of Relations Between Government and Business |last1=Schlaifer |first1=Robert |year=1950 }}</ref> Soon it was realized that motor vehicle fuels were unsatisfactory for aviation, and after the loss of a number of combat aircraft, attention turned to the quality of the gasolines being used. Later flight tests conducted in 1937, showed that an octane reduction of 13 points (from 100 down to 87 octane) decreased engine performance by 20 percent and increased take-off distance by 45 percent.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 252</ref> If abnormal combustion were to occur, the engine could lose enough power to make getting airborne impossible and a take-off roll became a threat to the pilot and aircraft.\n\nOn 2 August 1917, the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] arranged to study fuels for aircraft in cooperation with the Aviation Section of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] and a general survey concluded that no reliable data existed for the proper fuels for aircraft. As a result, flight tests began at Langley, McCook and Wright fields to determine how different gasolines performed under different conditions. These tests showed that in certain aircraft, motor vehicle gasolines performed as well as \"High-Test\" but in other types resulted in hot-running engines. It was also found that gasolines from aromatic and naphthenic base crude oils from California, South Texas and Venezuela resulted in smooth-running engines. These tests resulted in the first government specifications for motor gasolines (aviation gasolines used the same specifications as motor gasolines) in late 1917.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 3.</ref>\n\n===United States, 1918\u20131929===\n\nEngine designers knew that, according to the [[Otto cycle]], power and efficiency increased with compression ratio, but experience with early gasolines during World War I showed that higher compression ratios increased the risk of abnormal combustion, producing lower power, lower efficiency, hot-running engines and potentially severe engine damage. To compensate for these poor fuels, early engines used low compression ratios, which required relatively large, heavy engines to produce limited power and efficiency. The [[Wright brothers]]' first gasoline engine used a compression ratio as low as 4.7-to-1, developed only {{convert|12|hp}} from {{convert|201|cuin|cc}} and weighed {{convert|180|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Engines_&_Props/1903_Engine.htm |title = 1903 Wright Engine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/document/111256746/Evaluation-of-Wright-Flyer-s-Engine |title = Evaluation of Wright Flyer's Engine &#124; Internal Combustion Engine &#124; Vehicle Parts}}</ref> This was a major concern for aircraft designers and the needs of the aviation industry provoked the search for fuels that could be used in higher-compression engines.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1919, the amount of thermally cracked gasoline utilized almost doubled. Also, the use of [[natural gasoline]] increased greatly. During this period, many U.S. states established specifications for motor gasoline but none of these agreed and were unsatisfactory from one standpoint or another. Larger oil refiners began to specify [[saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] material percentage (thermally cracked products caused gumming in both use and storage and unsaturated hydrocarbons are more reactive and tend to combine with impurities leading to gumming). In 1922, the U.S. government published the first specifications for aviation gasolines (two grades were designated as \"Fighting\" and \"Domestic\" and were governed by boiling points, color, sulphur content and a gum formation test) along with one \"Motor\" grade for automobiles. The gum test essentially eliminated thermally cracked gasoline from aviation usage and thus aviation gasolines reverted to fractionating straight-run naphthas or blending straight-run and highly treated thermally cracked naphthas. This situation persisted until 1929.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe automobile industry reacted to the increase in thermally cracked gasoline with alarm. Thermal cracking produced large amounts of both [[olefin|mono-]] and [[diolefin]]s (unsaturated hydrocarbons), which increased the risk of gumming.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 74.</ref> Also the volatility was decreasing to the point that fuel did not vaporize and was sticking to [[spark plug]]s and fouling them, creating hard starting and rough running in winter and sticking to cylinder walls, bypassing the pistons and rings and going into the crankcase oil.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.4271/200017 |p=346 |chapter=Adapting Engines to the Use of Available Fuels |title=SAE Technical Paper Series |volume=1 |year=1920 |last1=Vincent |first1=J.

The oil industry in turn accused the automakers of not doing enough to improve vehicle economy, and the dispute became known within the two industries as \"The Fuel Problem\". Animosity grew between the industries, each accusing the other of not doing anything to resolve matters, and relationships deteriorated. The situation was only resolved when the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) initiated a conference to address \"The Fuel Problem\" and a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) Committee was established in 1920, to oversee joint investigative programs and solutions. Apart from representatives of the two industries, the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) also played an instrumental role, with the [[U.S. Bureau of Standards]] being chosen as an impartial research organization to carry out many of the studies. Initially, all the programs were related to volatility and fuel consumption, ease of starting, crankcase oil dilution and acceleration.<ref>https://www.newcomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chapter-11-Marshall.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015249/https://www.newcomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chapter-11-Marshall.pdf |date=17 June 2018 }} p. 227.</ref>\n\n===Leaded gasoline controversy, 1924\u20131925===\n\nWith the increased use of thermally cracked gasolines came an increased concern regarding its effects on abnormal combustion, and this led to research for antiknock additives. In the late 1910s, researchers such as A.H. Gibson, [[Harry Ricardo]], [[Thomas Midgley Jr.]] and Thomas Boyd began to investigate abnormal combustion. Beginning in 1916, [[Charles F. Kettering]] began investigating additives based on two paths, the \"high percentage\" solution (where large quantities of [[ethanol]] were added) and the \"low percentage\" solution (where only 2\u20134 grams per gallon were needed). The \"low percentage\" solution ultimately led to the discovery of [[tetraethyllead]] (TEL) in December 1921, a product of the research of Midgley and Boyd. This innovation started a cycle of improvements in [[fuel efficiency]] that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline. Ethanol could not be patented but TEL could, so Kettering secured a patent for TEL and began promoting it instead of other options.\n\nThe dangers of compounds containing [[lead]] were well-established by then and Kettering was directly warned by Robert Wilson of MIT, Reid Hunt of Harvard, Yandell Henderson of Yale, and Charles Kraus of the University of Potsdam in Germany about its use. Kraus had worked on tetraethyllead for many years and called it \"a creeping and malicious poison\" that had killed a member of his dissertation committee.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thewaternetwork.com/article-FfV/a-creeping-and-malicious-poison-W8Gx1ojp1oQjUZtgCKL1jQ |title = The Water Network &#124; by AquaSPE}}</ref><ref name=\"Kovarik\">{{Cite journal|last=Kovarik|first=William|date=2005-10-01|title=Ethyl-leaded Gasoline: How a Classic Occupational Disease Became an International Public Health Disaster|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=11|issue=4|pages=384\u2013397|doi=10.1179/oeh.2005.11.4.384|issn=1077-3525|pmid=16350473}}</ref> On 27 October 1924, newspaper articles around the nation told of the workers at the Standard Oil refinery near [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], New Jersey who were producing TEL and were suffering from [[lead poisoning]]. By 30 October, the death toll had reached five.<ref name=\"Kovarik\" /> In November, the New Jersey Labor Commission closed the Bayway refinery and a grand jury investigation was started which had resulted in no charges by February 1925. Leaded gasoline sales were banned in New York City, Philadelphia and New Jersey. [[General Motors]], [[DuPont]], and Standard Oil, who were partners in [[Ethyl Corporation]], the company created to produce TEL, began to argue that there were no alternatives to leaded gasoline that would maintain fuel efficiency and still prevent engine knocking. After flawed studies determined that TEL-treated gasoline was not a public health issue, the controversy subsided.<ref name=\"Kovarik\" />\n\n===United States, 1930\u20131941===\n\nIn the five-year period prior to 1929, a great amount of experimentation was conducted on different testing methods for determining fuel resistance to abnormal combustion. It appeared engine knocking was dependent on a wide variety of parameters including compression, cylinder temperature, air-cooled or water-cooled engines, chamber shapes, intake temperatures, lean or rich mixtures and others. This led to a confusing variety of test engines that gave conflicting results, and no standard rating scale existed. By 1929, it was recognized by most aviation gasoline manufacturers and users that some kind of antiknock rating must be included in government specifications. In 1929, the [[octane rating]] scale was adopted, and in 1930, the first octane specification for aviation fuels was established. In the same year, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] specified fuels rated at 87 octane for its aircraft as a result of studies it conducted.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 22.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, research showed that hydrocarbon structure was extremely important to the antiknocking properties of fuel. Straight-chain [[alkane|paraffins]] in the boiling range of gasoline had low antiknock qualities while ring-shaped molecules such as [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (an example is [[benzene]]) had higher resistance to knocking.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 20.</ref> This development led to the search for processes that would produce more of these compounds from crude oils than achieved under straight distillation or thermal cracking. Research by the major refiners into conversion processes yielded isomerization, dehydration, and alkylation that could change the cheap and abundant [[butane]] into [[isooctane]], which became an important component in aviation fuel blending. To further complicate the situation, as engine performance increased, the altitude that aircraft could reach also increased, which resulted in concerns about the fuel freezing. The average temperature decrease is {{convert|3.6|F-change}} per {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} increase in altitude, and at {{convert|40000|ft|km}}, the temperature can approach {{convert|-70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Additives like benzene, with a freezing point of {{convert|42|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, would freeze in the gasoline and plug fuel lines. Substitute aromatics such as [[toluene]], [[xylene]] and [[cumene]] combined with limited benzene solved the problem.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 34.</ref>\n\nBy 1935, there were seven different aviation grades based on octane rating, two Army grades, four Navy grades and three commercial grades including the introduction of 100-octane aviation gasoline. By 1937, the Army established 100-octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and to add to the confusion, the government now recognized 14 different grades, in addition to 11 others in foreign countries. With some companies required to stock 14 grades of aviation fuel, none of which could be interchanged, the effect on the refiners was negative. The refining industry could not concentrate on large capacity conversion processes for so many different grades and a solution had to be found. By 1941, principally through the efforts of the Cooperative Fuel Research Committee, the number of grades for aviation fuels was reduced to three: 73, 91 and 100 octane.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 12\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe development of 100-octane aviation gasoline on an economic scale was due in part to [[Jimmy Doolittle]] who had become Aviation Manager of Shell Oil Company. He convinced Shell to invest in refining capacity to produce 100-octane on a scale that nobody needed since no aircraft  existed that required a fuel that nobody made. Some fellow employees would call his effort \"Doolittle's million-dollar blunder\" but time would prove Doolittle correct. Before this the Army had considered 100-octane tests using pure octane but at $25 a gallon the price prevented this from happening. In 1929 Stanavo Specification Board, Inc. was organized by the Standard Oil companies of California, Indiana and New Jersey to improve aviation fuels and oils and by 1935 had placed their first 100 octane fuel on the market, Stanavo Ethyl Gasoline 100. It was used by the Army, engine manufacturers and airlines for testing and for air racing and record flights.<ref>https://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/THE-1936-AIRCRAFT-YEAR-BOOK.pdf</ref>   By 1936 tests at Wright Field using the new, cheaper alternatives to pure octane proved the value of 100 octane fuel and both Shell and Standard Oil would win the contract to supply test quantities for the Army. By 1938 the price was down to 17.5 cents a gallon, only 2.5 cents more than 87 octane fuel. By the end of WW II the price would be down to 16 cents a gallon.<ref>https://media.defense.gov/2017/Nov/21/2001847256/-1/-1/0/DP_0017_BISHOP_JIMMY_DOOLITTLE.PDF</ref>  \n\nIn 1937, [[Eugene Houdry]] developed the Houdry process of [[catalytic cracking]], which produced a high-octane base stock of gasoline which was superior to the thermally cracked product since it did not contain the high concentration of olefins.<ref name=\"Matthew Van Winkle 1944, pp. 1\"/> In 1940, there were only 14 Houdry units in operation in the U.S.; by 1943, this had increased to 77, either of the Houdry process or of the Thermofor Catalytic or Fluid Catalyst type.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe search for fuels with octane ratings above 100 led to the extension of the scale by comparing power output. A fuel designated grade 130 would produce 130 percent as much power in an engine as it would running on pure iso-octane. During WW II, fuels above 100-octane were given two ratings, a rich and lean mixture and these would be called 'performance numbers' (PN). 100-octane aviation gasoline would be referred to as 130/100 grade.<ref>Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, Aviation Gasoline Production and Control, Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September, 1947, p. 2 https://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Studies/51-100/AFD-090601-038.pdf</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\n\n====Germany====\nOil and its byproducts, especially high-octane aviation gasoline, would prove to be a driving concern for how Germany conducted the war. As a result of the lessons of World War I, Germany had stockpiled oil and gasoline for its [[blitzkrieg]] offensive and had annexed Austria, adding 18,000 barrels per day of oil production, but this was not sufficient to sustain the planned conquest of Europe. Because captured supplies and oil fields would be necessary to fuel the campaign, the German high command created a special squad of oil-field experts drawn from the ranks of domestic oil industries. They were sent in to put out oil-field fires and get production going again as soon as possible. But capturing oil fields remained an obstacle throughout the war. During the [[Invasion of Poland]], German estimates of gasoline consumption turned out to be vastly underestimated. [[Heinz Guderian]] and his [[Panzer division]]s consumed nearly {{convert|1000|gal/mi|liter/km}} of gasoline on the drive to [[Vienna]]. When they were engaged in combat across open country, gasoline consumption almost doubled. On the second day of battle, a unit of the XIX Corps was forced to halt when it ran out of gasoline.<ref>Robert W. Czeschin, ''The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s'', Agora Inc., 1988, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> One of the major objectives of the Polish invasion was their oil fields but the Soviets invaded and captured 70 percent of the Polish production before the Germans could reach it. Through the [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)]], Stalin agreed in vague terms to supply Germany with additional oil equal to that produced by now Soviet-occupied Polish oil fields at Drohobych and Boryslav in exchange for hard coal and steel tubing.\n\nEven after the Nazis conquered the vast territories of Europe, this did not help the gasoline shortage. This area had never been self-sufficient in oil before the war. In 1938, the area that would become Nazi-occupied would produce 575,000 barrels per day. In 1940, total production under German control amounted to only {{convert|234,550|oilbbl}}\u2014a shortfall of 59 percent.<ref>Robert W. Czeschin, ''The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s'', Agora Inc., 1988, p. 17.</ref> By the spring of 1941 and the depletion of German gasoline reserves, [[Adolf Hitler]] saw the invasion of Russia to seize the Polish oil fields and the Russian oil in the Caucasus as the solution to the German gasoline shortage. As early as July 1941, following the 22 June start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], certain Luftwaffe squadrons were forced to curtail ground support missions due to shortages of aviation gasoline. On 9 October, the German quartermaster general estimated that army vehicles were {{convert|24,000|oilbbl}} barrels short of gasoline requirements.<ref>Robert W. Czeschin, ''The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s'', Agora Inc., 1988, p. 19.</ref>\n\nVirtually all of Germany's aviation gasoline came from synthetic oil plants that hydrogenated coals and coal tars. These processes had been developed during the 1930s as an effort to achieve fuel independence. There were two grades of aviation gasoline produced in volume in Germany, the B-4 or blue grade and the C-3 or green grade, which accounted for about two-thirds of all production. B-4 was equivalent to 89-octane and the C-3 was roughly equal to the U.S. 100-octane, though lean mixture was rated around 95-octane and was poorer than the U.S. Maximum output achieved in 1943 reached 52,200 barrels a day before the Allies decided to target the synthetic fuel plants. Through captured enemy aircraft and analysis of the gasoline found in them, both the Allies and the Axis powers were aware of the quality of the aviation gasoline being produced and this prompted an octane race to achieve the advantage in aircraft performance. Later in the war the C-3 grade was improved to where it was equivalent to the U.S. 150 grade (rich mixture rating).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kurfurst.org/Engine/Fuel/German_fuel_specifications_and_production.html | title=Kurf\u00fcrst - TECHNICAL REPORT NO. 145-45 MANUFACTURE OF AVIATION GASOLINE IN GERMANY}}</ref>\n\n====Japan====\nJapan, like Germany, had almost no domestic oil supply and by the late 1930s, produced only 7% of its own oil while importing the rest \u2013 80% from the United States. As Japanese aggression grew in China ([[USS Panay incident]]) and news reached the American public of Japanese bombing of civilian centers, especially the bombing of Chungking, public opinion began to support a U.S. embargo. A Gallup poll in June 1939, found that 72 percent of the American public supported an embargo on war materials to Japan. This increased tensions between the U.S. and Japan led to the U.S. placing restrictions on exports and in July 1940, the U.S. issued a proclamation that banned the export of 87 octane or higher aviation gasoline to Japan. This ban did not hinder the Japanese as their aircraft could operate with fuels below 87 octane and if needed they could add [[Tetraethyllead|TEL]] to increase the octane. As it turned out, Japan bought 550 percent more sub-87 octane aviation gasoline in the five months after the July 1940, ban on higher octane sales.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 310\u201312</ref> The possibility of a complete ban of gasoline from America created friction in the Japanese government as to what action to take to secure more supplies from the Dutch East Indies and demanded greater oil exports from the exiled Dutch government after the [[Battle of the Netherlands]]. This action prompted the U.S. to move its Pacific fleet from Southern California to Pearl Harbor to help stiffen British resolve to stay in Indochina. With the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina]] in September 1940, came great concerns about the possible Japanese invasion of the Dutch Indies to secure their oil. After the U.S. banned all exports of steel and iron scrap, the next day Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and this led Washington to fear that a complete U.S. oil embargo would prompt the Japanese to invade the Dutch East Indies. On 16 June 1941 Harold Ickes, who was appointed Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, stopped a shipment of oil from Philadelphia to Japan in light of the oil shortage on the East coast due to increased exports to Allies. He also telegrammed all oil suppliers on the East coast not to ship any oil to Japan without his permission. President Roosevelt countermanded Ickes' orders telling Ickes that the \"... I simply have not got enough Navy to go around and every little episode in the Pacific means fewer ships in the Atlantic\".<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 316\u201317</ref> On 25 July, 1941, the U.S. froze all Japanese financial assets and licenses would be required for each use of the frozen funds including oil purchases that could produce aviation gasoline. On 28 July, 1941, Japan invaded southern Indochina.\n\nThe debate inside the Japanese government as to its oil and gasoline situation was leading to invasion of the Dutch East Indies but this would mean war with the U.S. whose Pacific fleet was a threat to their flank. This situation led to the decision to attack the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor before proceeding with the Dutch East Indies invasion. On 7 December, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the next day the Netherlands declared war on Japan which initiated the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]]. But the Japanese missed a golden opportunity at Pearl Harbor. \"All of the oil for the fleet was in surface tanks at the time of Pearl Harbor,\" Admiral Chester Nimitz, who became Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, was later to say. \"We had about {{convert|4+1/2|e6oilbbl|m3|disp=sqbr}} of oil out there and all of it was vulnerable to .50 caliber bullets. Had the Japanese destroyed the oil,\" he added, \"it would have prolonged the war another two years.\"<ref>Daniel Yergen, ''The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, p. 327</ref>\n\n====United States====\nEarly in 1944, William Boyd, president of the American Petroleum Institute and chairman of the Petroleum Industry War Council said: \"The Allies may have floated to victory on a wave of oil in World War I, but in this infinitely greater World War II, we are flying to victory on the wings of petroleum\". In December, 1941 the United States had 385,000 oil wells producing 1.4 billion barrels of oil a year and 100-octane aviation gasoline capacity was at 40,000 barrels a day. By 1944, the U.S. was producing over 1.5 billion barrels a year (67 percent of world production) and the petroleum industry had built 122 new plants for the production of 100-octane aviation gasoline and capacity was over 400,000 barrels a day \u2013 an increase of more than ten-fold. It was estimated that the U.S. was producing enough 100-octane aviation gasoline to permit the dropping of 20,000 tons of bombs on the enemy every day of the year. The record of gasoline consumption by the Army prior to June, 1943, was uncoordinated as each supply service of the Army purchased its own petroleum products and no centralized system of control nor records existed. On 1 June 1943 the Army created the Fuels and Lubricants Division of the Quartermaster Corps and from their records they tabulated that the Army (excluding fuels and lubricants for aircraft) purchased over 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline for delivery to overseas theaters between 1 June, 1943, through August, 1945. That figure does not include gasoline used by the Army inside the United States.<ref>Erna Risch and Chester L. Kieffer, ''United States Army in World War II'', The Technical Services, The Quartermaster Corps: Organization, Supply, and Services, Office of the CHief of Military History, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., 1955, p. 128-129</ref> Motor fuel production had declined from 701,000,000 barrels in 1941 down to 608,000,000 barrels in 1943.<ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1946'', Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, p. 499</ref> World War II marked the first time in U.S. history that gasoline was rationed and the government imposed price controls to prevent inflation. Gasoline consumption per automobile declined from 755 gallons per year in 1941 down to 540 gallons in 1943, with the goal of preserving rubber for tires since the Japanese had cut the U.S. off from over 90 percent of its rubber supply which had come from the Dutch East Indies and the U.S. synthetic rubber industry was in its infancy. Average gasoline prices went from an all-time record low of $0.1275 per gallon ($0.1841 with taxes) in 1940 to $0.1448 per gallon ($0.2050 with taxes) in 1945.<ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1946'', Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, pp. 512\u201318</ref>\n\nEven with the world's largest aviation gasoline production, the U.S. military still found that more was needed. Throughout the duration of the war, aviation gasoline supply was always behind requirements and this impacted training and operations. The reason for this shortage developed before the war even began. The free market did not support the expense of producing 100-octane aviation fuel in large volume, especially during the Great Depression. Iso-octane in the early development stage cost $30 a gallon and even by 1934, it was still $2 a gallon compared to $0.18 for motor gasoline when the Army decided to experiment with 100-octane for its combat aircraft. Though only 3 percent of U.S. combat aircraft in 1935 could take full advantage of the higher octane due to low compression ratios, the Army saw the need for increasing performance warranted the expense and purchased 100,000 gallons. By 1937 the Army established 100-octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and by 1939 production was only 20,000 barrels a day. In effect, the U.S. military was the only market for 100-octane aviation gasoline and as war broke out in Europe this created a supply problem that persisted throughout the duration.<ref>Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, ''Aviation Gasoline Production and Control'', Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September, 1947, p. 3 https://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Studies/51-100/AFD-090601-038.pdf</ref><ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1944'', Thomas Nelson & Sons,  1945, p. 509</ref>\n\nWith the war in Europe in 1939, a reality, all predictions of 100-octane consumption were outrunning all possible production. Neither the Army  nor the Navy could contract more than six months in advance for fuel and they could not supply the funds for plant expansion. Without a long term guaranteed market the petroleum industry would not risk its capital to expand production for a product that only the government would buy. The solution to the expansion of storage, transportation, finances and production was the creation of the Defense Supplies Corporation on 19 September 1940. The Defense Supplies Corporation would buy, transport and store all aviation gasoline for the Army and Navy at cost plus a carrying fee.<ref>Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, ''Aviation Gasoline Production and Control'', Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September 1947, p. 4  https://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Studies/51-100/AFD-090601-038.pdf</ref>\n\nWhen the Allied breakout after D-Day found their armies stretching their supply lines to a dangerous point, the makeshift solution was the [[Red Ball Express]]. But even this soon was inadequate. The trucks in the convoys had to drive longer distances as the armies advanced and they were consuming a greater percentage of the same gasoline they were trying to deliver. In 1944, General George Patton's Third Army finally stalled just short of the German border after running out of gasoline. The general was so upset at the arrival of a truckload of rations instead of gasoline he was reported to have shouted: \"Hell, they send us food, when they know we can fight without food but not without oil.\"<ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1946'', Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, p. 498</ref> The solution had to wait for the repairing of the railroad lines and bridges so that the more efficient trains could replace the gasoline consuming truck convoys.\n\n===United States, 1946 to present===\nThe development of jet engines burning kerosene-based fuels during WW II for aircraft produced a superior performing propulsion system than internal combustion engines could offer and the U.S. military forces gradually replaced their piston combat aircraft with jet powered planes. This development would essentially remove the military need for ever increasing octane fuels and eliminated government support for the refining industry to pursue the research and production of such exotic and expensive fuels. Commercial aviation was slower to adapt to jet propulsion and until 1958 when the [[Boeing 707]] first entered commercial service, piston powered airliners still relied on aviation gasoline. But commercial aviation had greater economic concerns than the maximum performance that the military could afford. As octane numbers increased so did the cost of gasoline but the incremental increase in efficiency becomes less as compression ratio goes up. This reality set a practical limit to how high compression ratios could increase relative to how expensive the gasoline would become.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 44547538|title = The economics of HIGH-OCTANE GASOLINES|journal = SAE Transactions|volume = 67|pages = 343\u2013350|last1 = Kavanagh|first1 = F.

This compares to the Wright Brothers engine needing almost 17 pounds of engine weight to produce 1 horsepower.\n\nThe US automobile industry after WWII could not take advantage of the high octane fuels then available. Automobile compression ratios increased from an average of 5.3-to-1 in 1931 to just 6.7-to-1 in 1946. The average octane number of regular grade motor gasoline increased from 58 to 70 during the same time. Military aircraft were using expensive turbo-supercharged engines that cost at least 10 times as much per horsepower as automobile engines and had to be overhauled every 700 to 1,000 hours. The automobile market could not support such expensive engines.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gold V. |last=Sanders |p=124\u2013126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA2 |title = Popular Science|date = June 1946}}</ref> It would not be until 1957 that the first US automobile manufacturer could mass-produce an engine that would produce one horsepower per cubic inch, the Chevrolet 283&nbsp;hp/283 cubic inch V-8 engine option in the Corvette.

The 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline. These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other antiknock compounds. Subsequently, low-sulfur gasoline was introduced, in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n==Chemical analysis and production==\n[[File:GasolineComp.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Some of the main components of gasoline: [[isooctane]], [[butane]], 3-[[ethyltoluene]], and the octane enhancer [[MTBE]]]]\n[[File:Nodding donkey.jpg|thumb|A [[pumpjack]] in the United States]]\n[[File:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|An oil rig in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]\nGasoline is produced in [[oil refinery|oil refineries]].

The usage of the terms ''paraffin'' and ''olefin'' in place of the standard chemical nomenclature ''alkane'' and ''alkene'', respectively, is particular to the oil industry. The actual ratio of molecules in any gasoline depends upon:\n* the oil refinery that makes the gasoline, as not all refineries have the same set of processing units;\n* the [[crude oil]] feed used by the refinery;\n* the grade of gasoline (in particular, the octane rating).\n\nThe various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics. Some important streams include:\n* '''straight-run gasoline''', commonly referred to as ''naphtha'', which is distilled directly from crude oil. Once the leading source of fuel, its low octane rating required lead additives. It is low in aromatics (depending on the grade of the crude oil stream) and contains some cycloalkanes (naphthenes) and no olefins (alkenes). Between 0 and 20 percent of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline, because the supply of this fraction is insufficient{{clarify|date=January 2015}} and its [[Octane rating#Research Octane Number (RON)|RON]] is too low.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The chemical properties (namely RON and [[Reid vapor pressure]]) of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through [[Catalytic reforming|reforming]] and [[isomerisation]]. However, before feeding those units, the naphtha needs to be split into light and heavy naphtha. Straight-run gasoline can also be used as a feedstock for steam-crackers to produce olefins.\n* '''reformate''', produced in a [[catalytic reformer]], has a high octane rating with high aromatic content and relatively low olefin content. Most of the [[benzene]], [[toluene]] and [[xylene]] (the so-called [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] hydrocarbons) are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent.\n* '''catalytic cracked gasoline''', or catalytic cracked [[petroleum naphtha|naphtha]], produced with a [[Fluid catalytic cracking|catalytic cracker]], has a moderate octane rating, high olefin content and moderate aromatic content.\n* '''hydrocrackate''' (heavy, mid and light), produced with a [[hydrocracker]], has a medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels.\n* '''alkylate''' is produced in an [[alkylation]] unit, using [[isobutane]] and olefins as feedstocks. Finished alkylate contains no aromatics or olefins and has a high MON.\n* '''isomerate''' is obtained by isomerizing low-octane straight-run gasoline into iso-paraffins (non-chain alkanes, such as [[isooctane]]). Isomerate has a medium RON and MON, but no aromatics or olefins.\n* '''butane''' is usually blended in the gasoline pool, although the quantity of this stream is limited by the RVP specification.\n\nThe terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies.\n\nCurrently, many countries set limits on gasoline [[aromatic]]s in general, benzene in particular, and olefin (alkene) content. Such regulations have led to an increasing preference for high-octane pure paraffin (alkane) components, such as alkylate, and are forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content. In the European Union, the benzene limit is set at 1% by volume for all grades of automotive gasoline.\n\nGasoline can also contain other [[organic compound]]s, such as [[organic ether]]s (deliberately added), plus small levels of contaminants, in particular [[organosulfur]] compounds (which are usually removed at the refinery).\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[File:GasStationHiroshima.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gasoline station in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]]]\n\n===Density===\n\nThe [[specific gravity]] of gasoline is from 0.71 to 0.77,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lead-Free gasoline Material Safety Data Sheet |author=Bell Fuels |publisher=[[NOAA]] |url=http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/HTMLdocs/Gasoline.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820074636/http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/HTMLdocs/Gasoline.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 August 2002 }}</ref> with higher densities having a greater volume of aromatics.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ya\u015far|last=Demirel|title=Energy: Production, Conversion, Storage, Conservation, and Coupling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsY8gJP7b58C&pg=PA33|date=26 January 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2371-2|page=33}}</ref> Finished marketable gasoline is traded (in Europe) with a standard reference of {{cvt|0.755|kg/L|lb/USgal}}, and its price is escalated or de-escalated according to its actual density.{{clarify|reason=Denser gasoline is more expensive or less expensive?|date=May 2019}} Because of its low density, gasoline floats on water, and so water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless applied in a fine mist.\n\n===Stability===\nQuality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly, but as gasoline is a mixture rather than a single compound, it will break down slowly over time due to the separation of the components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long-term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a [[fuel injection]] system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Gasoline should ideally be stored in an airtight container (to prevent [[oxidation]] or water vapor mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the [[vapor pressure]] of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may result, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called \"stale fuel\". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).\n\nThe presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank or fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly, though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long-term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing [[mineral spirits]], [[isopropyl alcohol]], [[1,2,4-trimethylbenzene]] or [[gasoline additive|other additives]]. Fuel stabilizers are commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is sporadic or seasonal (little to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nGasoline stability requirements are set by the standard [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D4814. This standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines.\n\n===Energy content===\n\nA gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine obtains energy from the combustion of gasoline's various hydrocarbons with oxygen from the ambient air, yielding [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] as exhaust. The combustion of octane, a representative species, performs the chemical reaction:\n\n<chem>2 C8H18 + 25 O2 -> 16 CO2 + 18 H2O\n</chem>\n\nBy weight, gasoline contains about {{convert|46.7|MJ/kg|kWh/kg MJ/lb|lk=on|abbr=on}} or by volume {{convert|33.6|MJ/l|kWh/l MJ/usgal Btu/usgal|abbr=out|lk=in}}, quoting the lower heating value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=about_energy_units|title=Energy Information Administration|website=www.eia.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215012732/http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=about_energy_units|archivedate=15 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gasoline blends differ, and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 1.75% more or less than the average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf|title=Fuel Properties Comparison|last=|first=|date=|website=Alternative Fuels Data Center|publisher=|access-date=31 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031034323/http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On average, about 74 L (19.5 US gal; 16.3 imp gal) of gasoline are available from a barrel of crude oil (about 46% by volume), varying with the quality of the crude and the grade of the gasoline.

An engine [[engine tuning|tuned]] for [[Autogas|LPG]] fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which is by far the greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An [[Atkinson cycle]] engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of [[diesel engine]]s, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.\n\nThe lower energy content of LPG by liquid volume in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density. This lower density is a property of the lower [[molecular weight]] of [[propane]] (LPG's chief component) compared to gasoline's blend of various hydrocarbon compounds with heavier molecular weights than propane. Conversely, LPG's energy content by weight is higher than gasoline's due to a higher [[hydrogen]]-to-[[carbon]] ratio.\n\nMolecular weights of the representative octane combustion are C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> 114, O<sub>2</sub> 32, CO<sub>2</sub> 44, H<sub>2</sub>O 18; therefore 1&nbsp;kg of fuel reacts with 3.51&nbsp;kg of oxygen to produce 3.09&nbsp;kg of carbon dioxide and 1.42&nbsp;kg of water.\n\n==Octane rating==\n{{main|Octane rating}}\n\n[[Spark-ignition engine]]s are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called [[deflagration]]. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by pressure and heat alone, rather than igniting from the [[spark plug]] at exactly the right time, causing a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This is often referred to as [[engine knocking]] or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to [[autoignition temperature|autoignition]], which is expressed by its octane rating.\n\nOctane rating is measured relative to a mixture of [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (an [[isomer]] of [[octane]]) and n-[[heptane]]. There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings, so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used. One of the best known is the research octane number (RON).\n\nThe octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country. In [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], 95 RON is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is sold at 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON, and super-unleaded is usually 97\u201398 RON.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines, and in 2006 the supermarket chain [[Tesco]] began to sell super-unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON.\n\nIn the United States, octane ratings in unleaded fuels vary between 85<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/octane-warning-labels-not-posted-at-many-gas-stations/article_681e07bc-3cd3-5e0c-a3c7-c06fcc4d319c.html|title=85-octane warning labels not posted at many gas stations|author=Ryan Lengerich Journal staff|work=Rapid City Journal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615025518/http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/octane-warning-labels-not-posted-at-many-gas-stations/article_681e07bc-3cd3-5e0c-a3c7-c06fcc4d319c.html|archivedate=15 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and 87 AKI (91\u201392 RON) for regular, 89\u201390 AKI (94\u201395 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90\u201394 AKI (95\u201399 RON) for premium (European premium).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| || 91 || 92 || 93 || 94 || 95 || 96 || 97 || 98 || 99 || 100 || 101 || 102\n|-\n| Scandinavia || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\" | || regular || || || premium ||\n|-\n| UK || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\" | || regular || || premium || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | super || || || high-performance\n|-\n| USA || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | regular || || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | mid-grade || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\" | premium\n|}\n\nAs South Africa's largest city, [[Johannesburg]], is located on the [[Highveld]] at {{convert|1753|m|ft}} above sea level, the [[Automobile Association of South Africa]] recommends 95-octane gasoline at low altitude and 93-octane for use in Johannesburg because \"The higher the altitude the lower the air pressure, and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.co.za/about/press-room/press-releases/9593-what-is-the-difference-reallyij.html |title=95/93 \u2013 What is the Difference, Really? |publisher=Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) |accessdate=26 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229112643/https://www.aa.co.za/about/press-room/press-releases/9593-what-is-the-difference-reallyij.html |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOctane rating became important as the military sought higher output for [[aircraft engine]]s in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher [[compression ratio]] or [[supercharger]] boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output.

For technical reasons, the use of leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of [[aviation gasoline]] such as [[100LL]], because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach without the use of leaded additives.\n[[File:GasCan.jpg|thumb|A gas can]]\n\n====Tetraethyllead====\n{{main|Tetraethyllead}}\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Lead]] -->\n\nGasoline, when used in high-[[compression (physical)|compression]] internal combustion engines, tends to autoignite or \"detonate\" causing damaging [[engine knocking]] (also called \"pinging\" or \"pinking\"). To address this problem, [[tetraethyllead]] (TEL) was widely adopted as an additive for gasoline in the 1920s. With the discovery of the seriousness of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by lead compounds, however, and the incompatibility of lead with [[catalytic converter]]s, governments began to mandate reductions in gasoline lead.\n\nIn the United States, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases, scheduled to begin in 1973 but delayed by court appeals until 1976. By 1995, leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6 percent of total gasoline sales and under 2000 [[short tons]] (1814 t) of lead per year. From 1 January 1996, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. Clean Air Act]] banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles in the U.S. The use of TEL also necessitated other additives, such as [[dibromoethane]].\n\nEuropean countries began replacing lead-containing additives by the end of the 1980s, and by the end of the 1990s, leaded gasoline was banned within the entire European Union.\n\nReduction in the average lead content of human blood is believed to be a major cause for falling violent crime rates around the world, including in the United States<ref name=\"WashingtonPostCrime\">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/lead-abatement-alcohol-taxes-and-10-other-ways-to-reduce-the-crime-rate-without-annoying-the-nra/ | title=Lead abatement, alcohol taxes and 10 other ways to reduce the crime rate without annoying the NRA | work=Washington Post | date=22 April 2013 | accessdate=23 May 2013 | author=Matthews, Dylan | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052321/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/lead-abatement-alcohol-taxes-and-10-other-ways-to-reduce-the-crime-rate-without-annoying-the-nra/ | archivedate=12 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and South Africa.<ref name=\"BusinessDayCrime\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/01/22/ban-on-lead-may-yet-give-us-respite-from-crime | title=Ban on lead may yet give us respite from crime | publisher=Business Day | date=22 January 2013 | accessdate=23 May 2013 | author=Marrs, Dave | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406072130/http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/01/22/ban-on-lead-may-yet-give-us-respite-from-crime | archivedate=6 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: taking into account a 22-year time lag, the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve.<ref name=\"Reyes\">Reyes, J.

According to the bulletin, the minimal U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] requirement is not sufficient to keep engines clean.<ref>\"Top Tier Detergent Gasoline (Deposits, Fuel Economy, No Start, Power, Performance, Stall Concerns)\", GM Bulletin, 04-06-04-047, 06-Engine/Propulsion System, June 2004</ref> Typical detergents include [[Amine#Classification of amines|alkylamines]] and [[alkyl phosphate]]s at the level of 50\u2013100 ppm.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Ethanol===\n{{see also|Ethanol fuel|Common ethanol fuel mixtures}}\n\n====European Union====\nIn the EU, 5% [[ethanol]] can be added within the common gasoline spec (EN 228). Discussions are ongoing to allow 10% blending of ethanol (available in Finnish, French and German gas stations). In Finland, most gasoline stations sell 95E10, which is 10% ethanol, and 98E5, which is 5% ethanol. Most gasoline sold in Sweden has 5\u201315% ethanol added. Three different ethanol blends are sold in the Netherlands\u2014E5, E10 and hE15. The last of these differs from standard ethanol\u2013gasoline blends in that it consists of 15% [[hydrous ethanol]] (i.e., the ethanol\u2013water [[azeotrope]]) instead of the anhydrous ethanol traditionally used for blending with gasoline.\n\n====Brazil====\nThe [[Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels]] (ANP) requires gasoline for automobile use to have 27.5% of ethanol added to its composition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.br/atividade/materia/detalhes.asp?p_cod_mate=100053|title=MEDIDA PROVIS\u00d3RIA n\u00ba 532, de 2011|work=senado.gov.br|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919030421/http://www.senado.gov.br/atividade/materia/detalhes.asp?p_cod_mate=100053|archivedate=19 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Pure hydrated ethanol is also available as a fuel.\n\n====Australia====\nLegislation requires retailers to label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser, and limits ethanol use to 10% of gasoline in Australia. Such gasoline is commonly called [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E10]] by major brands, and it is cheaper than regular unleaded gasoline.\n\n====United States====\nThe federal [[Renewable Fuel Standard]] (RFS) effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable [[biofuel]]s (mostly ethanol) with gasoline, sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended. Although the mandate does not require a specific percentage of ethanol, annual increases in the target combined with declining [[gasoline consumption]] has caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10%. Most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10% ethanol, an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage. Until late 2010, fuel retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol (E10), and most vehicle warranties (except for flexible fuel vehicles) authorize fuels that contain no more than 10 percent ethanol.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In parts of the United States, ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component.\n\n====India====\nIn October 2007, the [[Government of India]] decided to make 5% ethanol blending (with gasoline) mandatory.

The presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of [[carbon monoxide]] and unburned fuel in the exhaust. In many areas throughout the U.S., oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, or in the case of California, [[California reformulated gasoline]]. The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]]-controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/otaq/rfg_regs.htm#usage | title = Removal of Reformulated Gasoline Oxygen Content Requirement (national) and Revision of Commingling Prohibition to Address Non-0xygenated Reformulated Gasoline (national) | date = 22 February 2006 | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050920073346/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/rfg_regs.htm#usage | archivedate = 20 September 2005 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMTBE was phased out in the U.S. due to groundwater contamination and the resulting regulations and lawsuits.

It consists mostly of [[organic compound]]s obtained by the [[fractional distillation]] of petroleum, enhanced with a variety of [[gasoline additive|additives]]. On average, a {{convert|42|gal|liter|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Oil barrel|barrel]] of  [[Petroleum|crude oil]] yields about {{convert|19|gal|liter|abbr=off}} of gasoline (among other refined products) after processing in an [[oil refinery]], though this varies based on the [[crude oil assay]].\n\nThe characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes [[engine knocking|knocking]] and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its [[octane rating]] which is produced in several grades. [[Tetraethyl lead]] and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to increase octane rating (still used in aviation and auto-racing). Other chemicals are frequently added to gasoline to improve chemical stability and performance characteristics, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system cleaning. Gasoline may contain oxygen-containing chemicals such as [[ethanol]], [[MTBE]] or [[ETBE]] to improve combustion.\n\nGasoline used in internal combustion engines can have significant effects on the local environment, and is also a contributor to global human carbon dioxide emissions. Gasoline can also enter the environment uncombusted, both as liquid and as vapor, from leakage and handling during production, transport and delivery (e.g., from storage tanks, from spills, etc.). As an example of efforts to control such leakage, many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ust/preventing-and-detecting-underground-storage-tank-ust-releases|title=Preventing and Detecting Underground Storage Tank (UST) Releases |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |language=en|access-date=14 November 2018|date=13 October 2014 }}</ref> Gasoline contains [[benzene]] and other known [[carcinogen]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=36176#Download|title=Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Unleaded Gasoline|work=epa.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032708/http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=36176#Download|archivedate=27 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mehlman|first1=MA|title=Dangerous properties of petroleum-refining products: carcinogenicity of motor fuels (gasoline).|journal=Teratogenesis, Carcinogenesis, and Mutagenesis|date=1990|volume=10|issue=5|pages=399\u2013408|pmid=1981951|doi=10.1002/tcm.1770100505}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baumbach|first1=JI|last2=Sielemann|first2=S|last3=Xie|first3=Z|last4=Schmidt|first4=H|title=Detection of the gasoline components methyl tert-butyl ether, benzene, toluene, and m-xylene using ion mobility spectrometers with a radioactive and UV ionization source.|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=15 March 2003|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1483\u201390|pmid=12659213|doi=10.1021/ac020342i}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Gasoline\" is an English word that refers to fuel for [[automobile]]s.

The fuel for these early engines was a relatively volatile [[hydrocarbon]] obtained from [[coal gas]]. With a [[boiling point]] near {{convert|85|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} ([[octane]] boils about 40&nbsp;\u00b0C higher), it was well-suited for early [[carburetor]]s (evaporators). The development of a \"spray nozzle\" carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels. Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher [[compression ratio]]s, but early attempts were blocked by the premature explosion of fuel, known as [[engine knocking|knocking]].\n\nIn 1891, the [[Shukhov cracking process]] became the world's first commercial method to break down heavier hydrocarbons in crude oil to increase the percentage of lighter products compared to simple distillation.\n\n===1903 to 1914===\n\nThe evolution of gasoline followed the evolution of oil as the dominant source of energy in the industrializing world. Prior to World War One, Britain was the world's greatest industrial power and depended on its navy to protect the shipping of raw materials from its colonies. Germany was also industrializing and, like Britain, lacked many natural resources which had to be shipped to the home country. By the 1890s, Germany began to pursue a policy of global prominence and began building a navy to compete with Britain's. Coal was the fuel that powered their navies. Though both Britain and Germany had natural coal reserves, new developments in oil as a fuel for ships changed the situation. Coal-powered ships were a tactical weakness because the process of [[coaling (ships)|loading coal]] was extremely slow and dirty and left the ship completely vulnerable to attack, and unreliable supplies of coal at international ports made long-distance voyages impractical. The advantages of petroleum oil soon found the navies of the world converting to oil, but Britain and Germany had very few domestic oil reserves.<ref>Daniel Yergen, ''The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 150\u201363.</ref> Britain eventually solved its naval oil dependence by securing oil from [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] and this determined from where and of what quality its gasoline would come.\n\nDuring the early period of gasoline engine development, aircraft were forced to use motor vehicle gasoline since aviation gasoline did not yet exist. These early fuels were termed \"straight-run\" gasolines and were byproducts from the distillation of a single crude oil to produce [[kerosene]], which was the principal product sought for burning in [[kerosene lamp]]s. Gasoline production would not surpass kerosene production until 1916. The earliest straight-run gasolines were the result of distilling eastern crude oils and there was no mixing of distillates from different crudes. The composition of these early fuels was unknown and the quality varied greatly as crude oils from different oil fields emerged in different mixtures of hydrocarbons in different ratios. The engine effects produced by abnormal combustion ([[engine knocking]] and [[pre-ignition]]) due to inferior fuels had not yet been identified, and as a result there was no rating of gasoline in terms of its resistance to abnormal combustion. The general specification by which early gasolines were measured was that of [[specific gravity]] via the [[Baum\u00e9 scale]] and later the [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] (tendency to vaporize) specified in terms of boiling points, which became the primary focuses for gasoline producers. These early eastern crude oil gasolines had relatively high Baum\u00e9 test results (65 to 80 degrees Baum\u00e9) and were called Pennsylvania \"High-Test\" or simply \"High-Test\" gasolines. These would often be used in aircraft engines.\n\nBy 1910, increased automobile production and the resultant increase in gasoline consumption produced a greater demand for gasoline. Also, the growing electrification of lighting produced a drop in kerosene demand, creating a supply problem. It appeared that the burgeoning oil industry would be trapped into over-producing kerosene and under-producing gasoline since simple distillation could not alter the ratio of the two products from any given crude. The solution appeared in 1911, when the development of the [[Burton process]] allowed [[thermal cracking]] of crude oils, which increased the percent yield of gasoline from the heavier hydrocarbons. This was combined with expansion of foreign markets for the export of surplus kerosene which domestic markets no longer needed. These new thermally \"cracked\" gasolines were believed to have no harmful effects and would be added to straight-run gasolines. There also was the practice of mixing heavy and light distillates to achieve a desired Baum\u00e9 reading and collectively these were called \"blended\" gasolines.<ref name=\"Matthew Van Winkle 1944, pp. 1\">Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nGradually, volatility gained favor over the Baum\u00e9 test, though both would continue to be used in combination to specify a gasoline. As late as June 1917, [[Standard Oil]] (the largest refiner of crude oil in the United States at the time) stated that the most important property of a gasoline was its volatility.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKo7AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA2 |title = Farm Implements|publisher = Farm Implement Publishing Company|year = 1917}}</ref> It is estimated that the rating equivalent of these straight-run gasolines varied from 40 to 60 octane and that the \"High-Test\", sometimes referred to as \"fighting grade\", probably averaged 50 to 65 octane.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nPrior to the [[American entry into World War I]], the European Allies used fuels derived from crude oils from Borneo, Java and Sumatra, which gave satisfactory performance in their military aircraft. When the United States entered the war in April 1917, the U.S. became the principal supplier of aviation gasoline to the Allies and a decrease in engine performance was noted.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lo9TAAAAMAAJ&pg=GBS.PA575 |page=569 |title=Development of Aircraft Engines: Two Studies of Relations Between Government and Business |last1=Schlaifer |first1=Robert |year=1950 }}</ref> Soon it was realized that motor vehicle fuels were unsatisfactory for aviation, and after the loss of a number of combat aircraft, attention turned to the quality of the gasolines being used. Later flight tests conducted in 1937, showed that an octane reduction of 13 points (from 100 down to 87 octane) decreased engine performance by 20 percent and increased take-off distance by 45 percent.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 252</ref> If abnormal combustion were to occur, the engine could lose enough power to make getting airborne impossible and a take-off roll became a threat to the pilot and aircraft.\n\nOn 2 August 1917, the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] arranged to study fuels for aircraft in cooperation with the Aviation Section of the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] and a general survey concluded that no reliable data existed for the proper fuels for aircraft. As a result, flight tests began at Langley, McCook and Wright fields to determine how different gasolines performed under different conditions. These tests showed that in certain aircraft, motor vehicle gasolines performed as well as \"High-Test\" but in other types resulted in hot-running engines. It was also found that gasolines from aromatic and naphthenic base crude oils from California, South Texas and Venezuela resulted in smooth-running engines. These tests resulted in the first government specifications for motor gasolines (aviation gasolines used the same specifications as motor gasolines) in late 1917.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 3.</ref>\n\n===United States, 1918\u20131929===\n\nEngine designers knew that, according to the [[Otto cycle]], power and efficiency increased with compression ratio, but experience with early gasolines during World War I showed that higher compression ratios increased the risk of abnormal combustion, producing lower power, lower efficiency, hot-running engines and potentially severe engine damage. To compensate for these poor fuels, early engines used low compression ratios, which required relatively large, heavy engines to produce limited power and efficiency. The [[Wright brothers]]' first gasoline engine used a compression ratio as low as 4.7-to-1, developed only {{convert|12|hp}} from {{convert|201|cuin|cc}} and weighed {{convert|180|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.wright-brothers.org/Information_Desk/Just_the_Facts/Engines_&_Props/1903_Engine.htm |title = 1903 Wright Engine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/document/111256746/Evaluation-of-Wright-Flyer-s-Engine |title = Evaluation of Wright Flyer's Engine &#124; Internal Combustion Engine &#124; Vehicle Parts}}</ref> This was a major concern for aircraft designers and the needs of the aviation industry provoked the search for fuels that could be used in higher-compression engines.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1919, the amount of thermally cracked gasoline utilized almost doubled. Also, the use of [[natural gasoline]] increased greatly. During this period, many U.S. states established specifications for motor gasoline but none of these agreed and were unsatisfactory from one standpoint or another. Larger oil refiners began to specify [[saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] material percentage (thermally cracked products caused gumming in both use and storage and unsaturated hydrocarbons are more reactive and tend to combine with impurities leading to gumming). In 1922, the U.S. government published the first specifications for aviation gasolines (two grades were designated as \"Fighting\" and \"Domestic\" and were governed by boiling points, color, sulphur content and a gum formation test) along with one \"Motor\" grade for automobiles. The gum test essentially eliminated thermally cracked gasoline from aviation usage and thus aviation gasolines reverted to fractionating straight-run naphthas or blending straight-run and highly treated thermally cracked naphthas. This situation persisted until 1929.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe automobile industry reacted to the increase in thermally cracked gasoline with alarm. Thermal cracking produced large amounts of both [[olefin|mono-]] and [[diolefin]]s (unsaturated hydrocarbons), which increased the risk of gumming.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 74.</ref> Also the volatility was decreasing to the point that fuel did not vaporize and was sticking to [[spark plug]]s and fouling them, creating hard starting and rough running in winter and sticking to cylinder walls, bypassing the pistons and rings and going into the crankcase oil.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.4271/200017 |p=346 |chapter=Adapting Engines to the Use of Available Fuels |title=SAE Technical Paper Series |volume=1 |year=1920 |last1=Vincent |first1=J.

The oil industry in turn accused the automakers of not doing enough to improve vehicle economy, and the dispute became known within the two industries as \"The Fuel Problem\". Animosity grew between the industries, each accusing the other of not doing anything to resolve matters, and relationships deteriorated. The situation was only resolved when the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) initiated a conference to address \"The Fuel Problem\" and a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) Committee was established in 1920, to oversee joint investigative programs and solutions. Apart from representatives of the two industries, the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] (SAE) also played an instrumental role, with the [[U.S. Bureau of Standards]] being chosen as an impartial research organization to carry out many of the studies. Initially, all the programs were related to volatility and fuel consumption, ease of starting, crankcase oil dilution and acceleration.<ref>https://www.newcomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chapter-11-Marshall.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015249/https://www.newcomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chapter-11-Marshall.pdf |date=17 June 2018 }} p. 227.</ref>\n\n===Leaded gasoline controversy, 1924\u20131925===\n\nWith the increased use of thermally cracked gasolines came an increased concern regarding its effects on abnormal combustion, and this led to research for antiknock additives. In the late 1910s, researchers such as A.H. Gibson, [[Harry Ricardo]], [[Thomas Midgley Jr.]] and Thomas Boyd began to investigate abnormal combustion. Beginning in 1916, [[Charles F. Kettering]] began investigating additives based on two paths, the \"high percentage\" solution (where large quantities of [[ethanol]] were added) and the \"low percentage\" solution (where only 2\u20134 grams per gallon were needed). The \"low percentage\" solution ultimately led to the discovery of [[tetraethyllead]] (TEL) in December 1921, a product of the research of Midgley and Boyd. This innovation started a cycle of improvements in [[fuel efficiency]] that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline. Ethanol could not be patented but TEL could, so Kettering secured a patent for TEL and began promoting it instead of other options.\n\nThe dangers of compounds containing [[lead]] were well-established by then and Kettering was directly warned by Robert Wilson of MIT, Reid Hunt of Harvard, Yandell Henderson of Yale, and Charles Kraus of the University of Potsdam in Germany about its use. Kraus had worked on tetraethyllead for many years and called it \"a creeping and malicious poison\" that had killed a member of his dissertation committee.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thewaternetwork.com/article-FfV/a-creeping-and-malicious-poison-W8Gx1ojp1oQjUZtgCKL1jQ |title = The Water Network &#124; by AquaSPE}}</ref><ref name=\"Kovarik\">{{Cite journal|last=Kovarik|first=William|date=2005-10-01|title=Ethyl-leaded Gasoline: How a Classic Occupational Disease Became an International Public Health Disaster|journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=11|issue=4|pages=384\u2013397|doi=10.1179/oeh.2005.11.4.384|issn=1077-3525|pmid=16350473}}</ref> On 27 October 1924, newspaper articles around the nation told of the workers at the Standard Oil refinery near [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], New Jersey who were producing TEL and were suffering from [[lead poisoning]]. By 30 October, the death toll had reached five.<ref name=\"Kovarik\" /> In November, the New Jersey Labor Commission closed the Bayway refinery and a grand jury investigation was started which had resulted in no charges by February 1925. Leaded gasoline sales were banned in New York City, Philadelphia and New Jersey. [[General Motors]], [[DuPont]], and Standard Oil, who were partners in [[Ethyl Corporation]], the company created to produce TEL, began to argue that there were no alternatives to leaded gasoline that would maintain fuel efficiency and still prevent engine knocking. After flawed studies determined that TEL-treated gasoline was not a public health issue, the controversy subsided.<ref name=\"Kovarik\" />\n\n===United States, 1930\u20131941===\n\nIn the five-year period prior to 1929, a great amount of experimentation was conducted on different testing methods for determining fuel resistance to abnormal combustion. It appeared engine knocking was dependent on a wide variety of parameters including compression, cylinder temperature, air-cooled or water-cooled engines, chamber shapes, intake temperatures, lean or rich mixtures and others. This led to a confusing variety of test engines that gave conflicting results, and no standard rating scale existed. By 1929, it was recognized by most aviation gasoline manufacturers and users that some kind of antiknock rating must be included in government specifications. In 1929, the [[octane rating]] scale was adopted, and in 1930, the first octane specification for aviation fuels was established. In the same year, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] specified fuels rated at 87 octane for its aircraft as a result of studies it conducted.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 22.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, research showed that hydrocarbon structure was extremely important to the antiknocking properties of fuel. Straight-chain [[alkane|paraffins]] in the boiling range of gasoline had low antiknock qualities while ring-shaped molecules such as [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (an example is [[benzene]]) had higher resistance to knocking.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 20.</ref> This development led to the search for processes that would produce more of these compounds from crude oils than achieved under straight distillation or thermal cracking. Research by the major refiners into conversion processes yielded isomerization, dehydration, and alkylation that could change the cheap and abundant [[butane]] into [[isooctane]], which became an important component in aviation fuel blending. To further complicate the situation, as engine performance increased, the altitude that aircraft could reach also increased, which resulted in concerns about the fuel freezing. The average temperature decrease is {{convert|3.6|F-change}} per {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} increase in altitude, and at {{convert|40000|ft|km}}, the temperature can approach {{convert|-70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Additives like benzene, with a freezing point of {{convert|42|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, would freeze in the gasoline and plug fuel lines. Substitute aromatics such as [[toluene]], [[xylene]] and [[cumene]] combined with limited benzene solved the problem.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, p. 34.</ref>\n\nBy 1935, there were seven different aviation grades based on octane rating, two Army grades, four Navy grades and three commercial grades including the introduction of 100-octane aviation gasoline. By 1937, the Army established 100-octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and to add to the confusion, the government now recognized 14 different grades, in addition to 11 others in foreign countries. With some companies required to stock 14 grades of aviation fuel, none of which could be interchanged, the effect on the refiners was negative. The refining industry could not concentrate on large capacity conversion processes for so many different grades and a solution had to be found. By 1941, principally through the efforts of the Cooperative Fuel Research Committee, the number of grades for aviation fuels was reduced to three: 73, 91 and 100 octane.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 12\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe development of 100-octane aviation gasoline on an economic scale was due in part to [[Jimmy Doolittle]] who had become Aviation Manager of Shell Oil Company. He convinced Shell to invest in refining capacity to produce 100-octane on a scale that nobody needed since no aircraft  existed that required a fuel that nobody made. Some fellow employees would call his effort \"Doolittle's million-dollar blunder\" but time would prove Doolittle correct. Before this the Army had considered 100-octane tests using pure octane but at $25 a gallon the price prevented this from happening. In 1929 Stanavo Specification Board, Inc. was organized by the Standard Oil companies of California, Indiana and New Jersey to improve aviation fuels and oils and by 1935 had placed their first 100 octane fuel on the market, Stanavo Ethyl Gasoline 100. It was used by the Army, engine manufacturers and airlines for testing and for air racing and record flights.<ref>https://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/THE-1936-AIRCRAFT-YEAR-BOOK.pdf</ref>   By 1936 tests at Wright Field using the new, cheaper alternatives to pure octane proved the value of 100 octane fuel and both Shell and Standard Oil would win the contract to supply test quantities for the Army. By 1938 the price was down to 17.5 cents a gallon, only 2.5 cents more than 87 octane fuel. By the end of WW II the price would be down to 16 cents a gallon.<ref>https://media.defense.gov/2017/Nov/21/2001847256/-1/-1/0/DP_0017_BISHOP_JIMMY_DOOLITTLE.PDF</ref>  \n\nIn 1937, [[Eugene Houdry]] developed the Houdry process of [[catalytic cracking]], which produced a high-octane base stock of gasoline which was superior to the thermally cracked product since it did not contain the high concentration of olefins.<ref name=\"Matthew Van Winkle 1944, pp. 1\"/> In 1940, there were only 14 Houdry units in operation in the U.S.; by 1943, this had increased to 77, either of the Houdry process or of the Thermofor Catalytic or Fluid Catalyst type.<ref>Matthew Van Winkle, ''Aviation Gasoline Manufacture'', McGraw-Hill, 1944, pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe search for fuels with octane ratings above 100 led to the extension of the scale by comparing power output. A fuel designated grade 130 would produce 130 percent as much power in an engine as it would running on pure iso-octane. During WW II, fuels above 100-octane were given two ratings, a rich and lean mixture and these would be called 'performance numbers' (PN). 100-octane aviation gasoline would be referred to as 130/100 grade.<ref>Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, Aviation Gasoline Production and Control, Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September, 1947, p. 2 https://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Studies/51-100/AFD-090601-038.pdf</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\n\n====Germany====\nOil and its byproducts, especially high-octane aviation gasoline, would prove to be a driving concern for how Germany conducted the war. As a result of the lessons of World War I, Germany had stockpiled oil and gasoline for its [[blitzkrieg]] offensive and had annexed Austria, adding 18,000 barrels per day of oil production, but this was not sufficient to sustain the planned conquest of Europe. Because captured supplies and oil fields would be necessary to fuel the campaign, the German high command created a special squad of oil-field experts drawn from the ranks of domestic oil industries. They were sent in to put out oil-field fires and get production going again as soon as possible. But capturing oil fields remained an obstacle throughout the war. During the [[Invasion of Poland]], German estimates of gasoline consumption turned out to be vastly underestimated. [[Heinz Guderian]] and his [[Panzer division]]s consumed nearly {{convert|1000|gal/mi|liter/km}} of gasoline on the drive to [[Vienna]]. When they were engaged in combat across open country, gasoline consumption almost doubled. On the second day of battle, a unit of the XIX Corps was forced to halt when it ran out of gasoline.<ref>Robert W. Czeschin, ''The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s'', Agora Inc., 1988, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> One of the major objectives of the Polish invasion was their oil fields but the Soviets invaded and captured 70 percent of the Polish production before the Germans could reach it. Through the [[German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)]], Stalin agreed in vague terms to supply Germany with additional oil equal to that produced by now Soviet-occupied Polish oil fields at Drohobych and Boryslav in exchange for hard coal and steel tubing.\n\nEven after the Nazis conquered the vast territories of Europe, this did not help the gasoline shortage. This area had never been self-sufficient in oil before the war. In 1938, the area that would become Nazi-occupied would produce 575,000 barrels per day. In 1940, total production under German control amounted to only {{convert|234,550|oilbbl}}\u2014a shortfall of 59 percent.<ref>Robert W. Czeschin, ''The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s'', Agora Inc., 1988, p. 17.</ref> By the spring of 1941 and the depletion of German gasoline reserves, [[Adolf Hitler]] saw the invasion of Russia to seize the Polish oil fields and the Russian oil in the Caucasus as the solution to the German gasoline shortage. As early as July 1941, following the 22 June start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], certain Luftwaffe squadrons were forced to curtail ground support missions due to shortages of aviation gasoline. On 9 October, the German quartermaster general estimated that army vehicles were {{convert|24,000|oilbbl}} barrels short of gasoline requirements.<ref>Robert W. Czeschin, ''The Last Wave; Oil, War, and Financial Upheaval in the 1990s'', Agora Inc., 1988, p. 19.</ref>\n\nVirtually all of Germany's aviation gasoline came from synthetic oil plants that hydrogenated coals and coal tars. These processes had been developed during the 1930s as an effort to achieve fuel independence. There were two grades of aviation gasoline produced in volume in Germany, the B-4 or blue grade and the C-3 or green grade, which accounted for about two-thirds of all production. B-4 was equivalent to 89-octane and the C-3 was roughly equal to the U.S. 100-octane, though lean mixture was rated around 95-octane and was poorer than the U.S. Maximum output achieved in 1943 reached 52,200 barrels a day before the Allies decided to target the synthetic fuel plants. Through captured enemy aircraft and analysis of the gasoline found in them, both the Allies and the Axis powers were aware of the quality of the aviation gasoline being produced and this prompted an octane race to achieve the advantage in aircraft performance. Later in the war the C-3 grade was improved to where it was equivalent to the U.S. 150 grade (rich mixture rating).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kurfurst.org/Engine/Fuel/German_fuel_specifications_and_production.html | title=Kurf\u00fcrst - TECHNICAL REPORT NO. 145-45 MANUFACTURE OF AVIATION GASOLINE IN GERMANY}}</ref>\n\n====Japan====\nJapan, like Germany, had almost no domestic oil supply and by the late 1930s, produced only 7% of its own oil while importing the rest \u2013 80% from the United States. As Japanese aggression grew in China ([[USS Panay incident]]) and news reached the American public of Japanese bombing of civilian centers, especially the bombing of Chungking, public opinion began to support a U.S. embargo. A Gallup poll in June 1939, found that 72 percent of the American public supported an embargo on war materials to Japan. This increased tensions between the U.S. and Japan led to the U.S. placing restrictions on exports and in July 1940, the U.S. issued a proclamation that banned the export of 87 octane or higher aviation gasoline to Japan. This ban did not hinder the Japanese as their aircraft could operate with fuels below 87 octane and if needed they could add [[Tetraethyllead|TEL]] to increase the octane. As it turned out, Japan bought 550 percent more sub-87 octane aviation gasoline in the five months after the July 1940, ban on higher octane sales.<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 310\u201312</ref> The possibility of a complete ban of gasoline from America created friction in the Japanese government as to what action to take to secure more supplies from the Dutch East Indies and demanded greater oil exports from the exiled Dutch government after the [[Battle of the Netherlands]]. This action prompted the U.S. to move its Pacific fleet from Southern California to Pearl Harbor to help stiffen British resolve to stay in Indochina. With the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina]] in September 1940, came great concerns about the possible Japanese invasion of the Dutch Indies to secure their oil. After the U.S. banned all exports of steel and iron scrap, the next day Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and this led Washington to fear that a complete U.S. oil embargo would prompt the Japanese to invade the Dutch East Indies. On 16 June 1941 Harold Ickes, who was appointed Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense, stopped a shipment of oil from Philadelphia to Japan in light of the oil shortage on the East coast due to increased exports to Allies. He also telegrammed all oil suppliers on the East coast not to ship any oil to Japan without his permission. President Roosevelt countermanded Ickes' orders telling Ickes that the \"... I simply have not got enough Navy to go around and every little episode in the Pacific means fewer ships in the Atlantic\".<ref>Daniel Yergin, ''The Prize'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, pp. 316\u201317</ref> On 25 July, 1941, the U.S. froze all Japanese financial assets and licenses would be required for each use of the frozen funds including oil purchases that could produce aviation gasoline. On 28 July, 1941, Japan invaded southern Indochina.\n\nThe debate inside the Japanese government as to its oil and gasoline situation was leading to invasion of the Dutch East Indies but this would mean war with the U.S. whose Pacific fleet was a threat to their flank. This situation led to the decision to attack the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor before proceeding with the Dutch East Indies invasion. On 7 December, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the next day the Netherlands declared war on Japan which initiated the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]]. But the Japanese missed a golden opportunity at Pearl Harbor. \"All of the oil for the fleet was in surface tanks at the time of Pearl Harbor,\" Admiral Chester Nimitz, who became Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, was later to say. \"We had about {{convert|4+1/2|e6oilbbl|m3|disp=sqbr}} of oil out there and all of it was vulnerable to .50 caliber bullets. Had the Japanese destroyed the oil,\" he added, \"it would have prolonged the war another two years.\"<ref>Daniel Yergen, ''The Prize, The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power'', Simon & Schuster, 1992, p. 327</ref>\n\n====United States====\nEarly in 1944, William Boyd, president of the American Petroleum Institute and chairman of the Petroleum Industry War Council said: \"The Allies may have floated to victory on a wave of oil in World War I, but in this infinitely greater World War II, we are flying to victory on the wings of petroleum\". In December, 1941 the United States had 385,000 oil wells producing 1.4 billion barrels of oil a year and 100-octane aviation gasoline capacity was at 40,000 barrels a day. By 1944, the U.S. was producing over 1.5 billion barrels a year (67 percent of world production) and the petroleum industry had built 122 new plants for the production of 100-octane aviation gasoline and capacity was over 400,000 barrels a day \u2013 an increase of more than ten-fold. It was estimated that the U.S. was producing enough 100-octane aviation gasoline to permit the dropping of 20,000 tons of bombs on the enemy every day of the year. The record of gasoline consumption by the Army prior to June, 1943, was uncoordinated as each supply service of the Army purchased its own petroleum products and no centralized system of control nor records existed. On 1 June 1943 the Army created the Fuels and Lubricants Division of the Quartermaster Corps and from their records they tabulated that the Army (excluding fuels and lubricants for aircraft) purchased over 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline for delivery to overseas theaters between 1 June, 1943, through August, 1945. That figure does not include gasoline used by the Army inside the United States.<ref>Erna Risch and Chester L. Kieffer, ''United States Army in World War II'', The Technical Services, The Quartermaster Corps: Organization, Supply, and Services, Office of the CHief of Military History, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., 1955, p. 128-129</ref> Motor fuel production had declined from 701,000,000 barrels in 1941 down to 608,000,000 barrels in 1943.<ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1946'', Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, p. 499</ref> World War II marked the first time in U.S. history that gasoline was rationed and the government imposed price controls to prevent inflation. Gasoline consumption per automobile declined from 755 gallons per year in 1941 down to 540 gallons in 1943, with the goal of preserving rubber for tires since the Japanese had cut the U.S. off from over 90 percent of its rubber supply which had come from the Dutch East Indies and the U.S. synthetic rubber industry was in its infancy. Average gasoline prices went from an all-time record low of $0.1275 per gallon ($0.1841 with taxes) in 1940 to $0.1448 per gallon ($0.2050 with taxes) in 1945.<ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1946'', Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, pp. 512\u201318</ref>\n\nEven with the world's largest aviation gasoline production, the U.S. military still found that more was needed. Throughout the duration of the war, aviation gasoline supply was always behind requirements and this impacted training and operations. The reason for this shortage developed before the war even began. The free market did not support the expense of producing 100-octane aviation fuel in large volume, especially during the Great Depression. Iso-octane in the early development stage cost $30 a gallon and even by 1934, it was still $2 a gallon compared to $0.18 for motor gasoline when the Army decided to experiment with 100-octane for its combat aircraft. Though only 3 percent of U.S. combat aircraft in 1935 could take full advantage of the higher octane due to low compression ratios, the Army saw the need for increasing performance warranted the expense and purchased 100,000 gallons. By 1937 the Army established 100-octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and by 1939 production was only 20,000 barrels a day. In effect, the U.S. military was the only market for 100-octane aviation gasoline and as war broke out in Europe this created a supply problem that persisted throughout the duration.<ref>Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, ''Aviation Gasoline Production and Control'', Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September, 1947, p. 3 https://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Studies/51-100/AFD-090601-038.pdf</ref><ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1944'', Thomas Nelson & Sons,  1945, p. 509</ref>\n\nWith the war in Europe in 1939, a reality, all predictions of 100-octane consumption were outrunning all possible production. Neither the Army  nor the Navy could contract more than six months in advance for fuel and they could not supply the funds for plant expansion. Without a long term guaranteed market the petroleum industry would not risk its capital to expand production for a product that only the government would buy. The solution to the expansion of storage, transportation, finances and production was the creation of the Defense Supplies Corporation on 19 September 1940. The Defense Supplies Corporation would buy, transport and store all aviation gasoline for the Army and Navy at cost plus a carrying fee.<ref>Army Air Forces Historical Studies: No. 65, ''Aviation Gasoline Production and Control'', Air Historical Office Headquarters, Army Air Forces, September 1947, p. 4  https://www.afhra.af.mil/Portals/16/documents/Studies/51-100/AFD-090601-038.pdf</ref>\n\nWhen the Allied breakout after D-Day found their armies stretching their supply lines to a dangerous point, the makeshift solution was the [[Red Ball Express]]. But even this soon was inadequate. The trucks in the convoys had to drive longer distances as the armies advanced and they were consuming a greater percentage of the same gasoline they were trying to deliver. In 1944, General George Patton's Third Army finally stalled just short of the German border after running out of gasoline. The general was so upset at the arrival of a truckload of rations instead of gasoline he was reported to have shouted: \"Hell, they send us food, when they know we can fight without food but not without oil.\"<ref>Robert E. Allen, Director of Information, American Petroleum Institute, ''The American Year Book \u2013 1946'', Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1947, p. 498</ref> The solution had to wait for the repairing of the railroad lines and bridges so that the more efficient trains could replace the gasoline consuming truck convoys.\n\n===United States, 1946 to present===\nThe development of jet engines burning kerosene-based fuels during WW II for aircraft produced a superior performing propulsion system than internal combustion engines could offer and the U.S. military forces gradually replaced their piston combat aircraft with jet powered planes. This development would essentially remove the military need for ever increasing octane fuels and eliminated government support for the refining industry to pursue the research and production of such exotic and expensive fuels. Commercial aviation was slower to adapt to jet propulsion and until 1958 when the [[Boeing 707]] first entered commercial service, piston powered airliners still relied on aviation gasoline. But commercial aviation had greater economic concerns than the maximum performance that the military could afford. As octane numbers increased so did the cost of gasoline but the incremental increase in efficiency becomes less as compression ratio goes up. This reality set a practical limit to how high compression ratios could increase relative to how expensive the gasoline would become.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 44547538|title = The economics of HIGH-OCTANE GASOLINES|journal = SAE Transactions|volume = 67|pages = 343\u2013350|last1 = Kavanagh|first1 = F.

This compares to the Wright Brothers engine needing almost 17 pounds of engine weight to produce 1 horsepower.\n\nThe US automobile industry after WWII could not take advantage of the high octane fuels then available. Automobile compression ratios increased from an average of 5.3-to-1 in 1931 to just 6.7-to-1 in 1946. The average octane number of regular grade motor gasoline increased from 58 to 70 during the same time. Military aircraft were using expensive turbo-supercharged engines that cost at least 10 times as much per horsepower as automobile engines and had to be overhauled every 700 to 1,000 hours. The automobile market could not support such expensive engines.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gold V. |last=Sanders |p=124\u2013126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA2 |title = Popular Science|date = June 1946}}</ref> It would not be until 1957 that the first US automobile manufacturer could mass-produce an engine that would produce one horsepower per cubic inch, the Chevrolet 283&nbsp;hp/283 cubic inch V-8 engine option in the Corvette.

The 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline. These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other antiknock compounds. Subsequently, low-sulfur gasoline was introduced, in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n==Chemical analysis and production==\n[[File:GasolineComp.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Some of the main components of gasoline: [[isooctane]], [[butane]], 3-[[ethyltoluene]], and the octane enhancer [[MTBE]]]]\n[[File:Nodding donkey.jpg|thumb|A [[pumpjack]] in the United States]]\n[[File:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|An oil rig in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]\nGasoline is produced in [[oil refinery|oil refineries]].

The usage of the terms ''paraffin'' and ''olefin'' in place of the standard chemical nomenclature ''alkane'' and ''alkene'', respectively, is particular to the oil industry. The actual ratio of molecules in any gasoline depends upon:\n* the oil refinery that makes the gasoline, as not all refineries have the same set of processing units;\n* the [[crude oil]] feed used by the refinery;\n* the grade of gasoline (in particular, the octane rating).\n\nThe various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics. Some important streams include:\n* '''straight-run gasoline''', commonly referred to as ''naphtha'', which is distilled directly from crude oil. Once the leading source of fuel, its low octane rating required lead additives. It is low in aromatics (depending on the grade of the crude oil stream) and contains some cycloalkanes (naphthenes) and no olefins (alkenes). Between 0 and 20 percent of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline, because the supply of this fraction is insufficient{{clarify|date=January 2015}} and its [[Octane rating#Research Octane Number (RON)|RON]] is too low.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The chemical properties (namely RON and [[Reid vapor pressure]]) of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through [[Catalytic reforming|reforming]] and [[isomerisation]]. However, before feeding those units, the naphtha needs to be split into light and heavy naphtha. Straight-run gasoline can also be used as a feedstock for steam-crackers to produce olefins.\n* '''reformate''', produced in a [[catalytic reformer]], has a high octane rating with high aromatic content and relatively low olefin content. Most of the [[benzene]], [[toluene]] and [[xylene]] (the so-called [[BTX (chemistry)|BTX]] hydrocarbons) are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent.\n* '''catalytic cracked gasoline''', or catalytic cracked [[petroleum naphtha|naphtha]], produced with a [[Fluid catalytic cracking|catalytic cracker]], has a moderate octane rating, high olefin content and moderate aromatic content.\n* '''hydrocrackate''' (heavy, mid and light), produced with a [[hydrocracker]], has a medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels.\n* '''alkylate''' is produced in an [[alkylation]] unit, using [[isobutane]] and olefins as feedstocks. Finished alkylate contains no aromatics or olefins and has a high MON.\n* '''isomerate''' is obtained by isomerizing low-octane straight-run gasoline into iso-paraffins (non-chain alkanes, such as [[isooctane]]). Isomerate has a medium RON and MON, but no aromatics or olefins.\n* '''butane''' is usually blended in the gasoline pool, although the quantity of this stream is limited by the RVP specification.\n\nThe terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies.\n\nCurrently, many countries set limits on gasoline [[aromatic]]s in general, benzene in particular, and olefin (alkene) content. Such regulations have led to an increasing preference for high-octane pure paraffin (alkane) components, such as alkylate, and are forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content. In the European Union, the benzene limit is set at 1% by volume for all grades of automotive gasoline.\n\nGasoline can also contain other [[organic compound]]s, such as [[organic ether]]s (deliberately added), plus small levels of contaminants, in particular [[organosulfur]] compounds (which are usually removed at the refinery).\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[File:GasStationHiroshima.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gasoline station in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]]]\n\n===Density===\n\nThe [[specific gravity]] of gasoline is from 0.71 to 0.77,<ref>{{cite web|title=Lead-Free gasoline Material Safety Data Sheet |author=Bell Fuels |publisher=[[NOAA]] |url=http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/HTMLdocs/Gasoline.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820074636/http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/HTMLdocs/Gasoline.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 August 2002 }}</ref> with higher densities having a greater volume of aromatics.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ya\u015far|last=Demirel|title=Energy: Production, Conversion, Storage, Conservation, and Coupling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsY8gJP7b58C&pg=PA33|date=26 January 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2371-2|page=33}}</ref> Finished marketable gasoline is traded (in Europe) with a standard reference of {{cvt|0.755|kg/L|lb/USgal}}, and its price is escalated or de-escalated according to its actual density.{{clarify|reason=Denser gasoline is more expensive or less expensive?|date=May 2019}} Because of its low density, gasoline floats on water, and so water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless applied in a fine mist.\n\n===Stability===\nQuality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly, but as gasoline is a mixture rather than a single compound, it will break down slowly over time due to the separation of the components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long-term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a [[fuel injection]] system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Gasoline should ideally be stored in an airtight container (to prevent [[oxidation]] or water vapor mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the [[vapor pressure]] of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may result, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called \"stale fuel\". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).\n\nThe presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank or fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly, though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long-term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing [[mineral spirits]], [[isopropyl alcohol]], [[1,2,4-trimethylbenzene]] or [[gasoline additive|other additives]]. Fuel stabilizers are commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is sporadic or seasonal (little to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nGasoline stability requirements are set by the standard [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D4814. This standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines.\n\n===Energy content===\n\nA gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine obtains energy from the combustion of gasoline's various hydrocarbons with oxygen from the ambient air, yielding [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] as exhaust. The combustion of octane, a representative species, performs the chemical reaction:\n\n<chem>2 C8H18 + 25 O2 -> 16 CO2 + 18 H2O\n</chem>\n\nBy weight, gasoline contains about {{convert|46.7|MJ/kg|kWh/kg MJ/lb|lk=on|abbr=on}} or by volume {{convert|33.6|MJ/l|kWh/l MJ/usgal Btu/usgal|abbr=out|lk=in}}, quoting the lower heating value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=about_energy_units|title=Energy Information Administration|website=www.eia.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215012732/http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=about_energy_units|archivedate=15 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gasoline blends differ, and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 1.75% more or less than the average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf|title=Fuel Properties Comparison|last=|first=|date=|website=Alternative Fuels Data Center|publisher=|access-date=31 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031034323/http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_comparison_chart.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On average, about 74 L (19.5 US gal; 16.3 imp gal) of gasoline are available from a barrel of crude oil (about 46% by volume), varying with the quality of the crude and the grade of the gasoline.

An engine [[engine tuning|tuned]] for [[Autogas|LPG]] fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which is by far the greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An [[Atkinson cycle]] engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of [[diesel engine]]s, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.\n\nThe lower energy content of LPG by liquid volume in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density. This lower density is a property of the lower [[molecular weight]] of [[propane]] (LPG's chief component) compared to gasoline's blend of various hydrocarbon compounds with heavier molecular weights than propane. Conversely, LPG's energy content by weight is higher than gasoline's due to a higher [[hydrogen]]-to-[[carbon]] ratio.\n\nMolecular weights of the representative octane combustion are C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> 114, O<sub>2</sub> 32, CO<sub>2</sub> 44, H<sub>2</sub>O 18; therefore 1&nbsp;kg of fuel reacts with 3.51&nbsp;kg of oxygen to produce 3.09&nbsp;kg of carbon dioxide and 1.42&nbsp;kg of water.\n\n==Octane rating==\n{{main|Octane rating}}\n\n[[Spark-ignition engine]]s are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called [[deflagration]]. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by pressure and heat alone, rather than igniting from the [[spark plug]] at exactly the right time, causing a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This is often referred to as [[engine knocking]] or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to [[autoignition temperature|autoignition]], which is expressed by its octane rating.\n\nOctane rating is measured relative to a mixture of [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (an [[isomer]] of [[octane]]) and n-[[heptane]]. There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings, so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used. One of the best known is the research octane number (RON).\n\nThe octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country. In [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], 95 RON is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is sold at 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 RON, and super-unleaded is usually 97\u201398 RON.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines, and in 2006 the supermarket chain [[Tesco]] began to sell super-unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON.\n\nIn the United States, octane ratings in unleaded fuels vary between 85<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/octane-warning-labels-not-posted-at-many-gas-stations/article_681e07bc-3cd3-5e0c-a3c7-c06fcc4d319c.html|title=85-octane warning labels not posted at many gas stations|author=Ryan Lengerich Journal staff|work=Rapid City Journal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615025518/http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/octane-warning-labels-not-posted-at-many-gas-stations/article_681e07bc-3cd3-5e0c-a3c7-c06fcc4d319c.html|archivedate=15 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and 87 AKI (91\u201392 RON) for regular, 89\u201390 AKI (94\u201395 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90\u201394 AKI (95\u201399 RON) for premium (European premium).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| || 91 || 92 || 93 || 94 || 95 || 96 || 97 || 98 || 99 || 100 || 101 || 102\n|-\n| Scandinavia || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\" | || regular || || || premium ||\n|-\n| UK || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\" | || regular || || premium || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | super || || || high-performance\n|-\n| USA || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | regular || || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"2\" | mid-grade || ! scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\" | premium\n|}\n\nAs South Africa's largest city, [[Johannesburg]], is located on the [[Highveld]] at {{convert|1753|m|ft}} above sea level, the [[Automobile Association of South Africa]] recommends 95-octane gasoline at low altitude and 93-octane for use in Johannesburg because \"The higher the altitude the lower the air pressure, and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.co.za/about/press-room/press-releases/9593-what-is-the-difference-reallyij.html |title=95/93 \u2013 What is the Difference, Really? |publisher=Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) |accessdate=26 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229112643/https://www.aa.co.za/about/press-room/press-releases/9593-what-is-the-difference-reallyij.html |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOctane rating became important as the military sought higher output for [[aircraft engine]]s in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher [[compression ratio]] or [[supercharger]] boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output.

With the discovery of the seriousness of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by lead compounds, however, and the incompatibility of lead with [[catalytic converter]]s, governments began to mandate reductions in gasoline lead.\n\nIn the United States, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases, scheduled to begin in 1973 but delayed by court appeals until 1976. By 1995, leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6 percent of total gasoline sales and under 2000 [[short tons]] (1814 t) of lead per year. From 1 January 1996, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|U.S. Clean Air Act]] banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles in the U.S. The use of TEL also necessitated other additives, such as [[dibromoethane]].\n\nEuropean countries began replacing lead-containing additives by the end of the 1980s, and by the end of the 1990s, leaded gasoline was banned within the entire European Union.\n\nReduction in the average lead content of human blood is believed to be a major cause for falling violent crime rates around the world, including in the United States<ref name=\"WashingtonPostCrime\">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/lead-abatement-alcohol-taxes-and-10-other-ways-to-reduce-the-crime-rate-without-annoying-the-nra/ | title=Lead abatement, alcohol taxes and 10 other ways to reduce the crime rate without annoying the NRA | work=Washington Post | date=22 April 2013 | accessdate=23 May 2013 | author=Matthews, Dylan | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512052321/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/22/lead-abatement-alcohol-taxes-and-10-other-ways-to-reduce-the-crime-rate-without-annoying-the-nra/ | archivedate=12 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and South Africa.<ref name=\"BusinessDayCrime\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/01/22/ban-on-lead-may-yet-give-us-respite-from-crime | title=Ban on lead may yet give us respite from crime | publisher=Business Day | date=22 January 2013 | accessdate=23 May 2013 | author=Marrs, Dave | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406072130/http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/01/22/ban-on-lead-may-yet-give-us-respite-from-crime | archivedate=6 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: taking into account a 22-year time lag, the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve.<ref name=\"Reyes\">Reyes, J.

These harmful deposits arise from the oxidation of [[alkene]]s and other minor components in gasoline (see [[drying oil]]s). Improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems. Previously, catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines were most susceptible to oxidation. The formation of gums is accelerated by copper salts, which can be neutralized by additives called [[metal deactivator]]s.\n\nThis degradation can be prevented through the addition of 5\u2013100 ppm of [[antioxidant]]s, such as [[phenylenediamine]]s and other [[amine]]s.<ref name=Ullmann/> Hydrocarbons with a [[bromine number]] of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered [[phenol]]s and oil-soluble strong amine bases, such as hindered phenols. \"Stale\" gasoline can be detected by a [[colorimetric]] [[enzymatic]] test for [[organic peroxide]]s produced by oxidation of the gasoline.<ref>{{patent|AU|2000/72399 A1|Gasoline test kit}}</ref><!---See http://www.patentlens.net/patentlens/structured.cgi?patnum=AU_2000/72399_A1#show if template link fails--->\n\nGasolines are also treated with [[metal deactivator]]s, which are compounds that sequester (deactivate) metal salts that otherwise accelerate the formation of gummy residues. The metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel.\n\n===Detergents===\n\nGasoline, as delivered at the pump, also contains additives to reduce internal engine carbon buildups, improve [[combustion]] and allow easier starting in cold climates. High levels of detergent can be found in [[Top Tier Detergent Gasoline]]s. The specification for Top Tier Detergent Gasolines was developed by four automakers: [[General Motors|GM]], [[Honda]], [[Toyota]], and [[BMW]].

In Finland, most gasoline stations sell 95E10, which is 10% ethanol, and 98E5, which is 5% ethanol. Most gasoline sold in Sweden has 5\u201315% ethanol added. Three different ethanol blends are sold in the Netherlands\u2014E5, E10 and hE15. The last of these differs from standard ethanol\u2013gasoline blends in that it consists of 15% [[hydrous ethanol]] (i.e., the ethanol\u2013water [[azeotrope]]) instead of the anhydrous ethanol traditionally used for blending with gasoline.\n\n====Brazil====\nThe [[Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels]] (ANP) requires gasoline for automobile use to have 27.5% of ethanol added to its composition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.br/atividade/materia/detalhes.asp?p_cod_mate=100053|title=MEDIDA PROVIS\u00d3RIA n\u00ba 532, de 2011|work=senado.gov.br|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919030421/http://www.senado.gov.br/atividade/materia/detalhes.asp?p_cod_mate=100053|archivedate=19 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Pure hydrated ethanol is also available as a fuel.\n\n====Australia====\nLegislation requires retailers to label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser, and limits ethanol use to 10% of gasoline in Australia. Such gasoline is commonly called [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E10]] by major brands, and it is cheaper than regular unleaded gasoline.\n\n====United States====\nThe federal [[Renewable Fuel Standard]] (RFS) effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable [[biofuel]]s (mostly ethanol) with gasoline, sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended. Although the mandate does not require a specific percentage of ethanol, annual increases in the target combined with declining [[gasoline consumption]] has caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10%. Most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10% ethanol, an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage. Until late 2010, fuel retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol (E10), and most vehicle warranties (except for flexible fuel vehicles) authorize fuels that contain no more than 10 percent ethanol.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In parts of the United States, ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component.\n\n====India====\nIn October 2007, the [[Government of India]] decided to make 5% ethanol blending (with gasoline) mandatory.

The presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of [[carbon monoxide]] and unburned fuel in the exhaust. In many areas throughout the U.S., oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, or in the case of California, [[California reformulated gasoline]].

Gasoline has a [[lower explosive limit]] of 1.4% by volume and an [[upper explosive limit]] of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite.

The term ''ignimbrite'' is not recommended by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences|IUGS]] Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks.<ref name=LeMaitre2002>{{cite book |editor-last= Le Maitre |editor-first= R. W. |date =2002 |title= Igneous Rocks: A Classification and Glossary of Terms |url= |location= New York, United States |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 92 |isbn= 978-0-511-06651-1 |author-link= }}</ref> <!-- what does IUGS recommend? -->\n\nIgnimbrite is the deposit of a pyroclastic density current, or [[pyroclastic flow]], which is a hot suspension of particles and gases flowing rapidly from a [[volcano]] and driven by being denser than the surrounding atmosphere. New Zealand geologist [[Patrick Marshall]] (1869-1950) derived the term ''ignimbrite'' from \"fiery rock dust cloud\" (from the [[Latin]] ''igni-'' (fire) and ''imbri-'' (rain)). Ignimbrites form as the result of immense explosions of pyroclastic ash, [[lapilli]] and blocks flowing down the sides of volcanoes.\n\nIgnimbrites are made of a very poorly sorted mixture of [[volcanic ash]] (or [[tuff]] when [[Lithification|lithified]]) and [[pumice]] lapilli, commonly with scattered lithic fragments. The ash is composed of glass shards and crystal fragments. Ignimbrites may be loose and unconsolidated, or lithified (solidified) rock called lapilli-tuff. Near the volcanic source, ignimbrites commonly contain thick accumulations of lithic blocks, and distally, many show meter-thick accumulations of rounded cobbles of pumice.\n\nIgnimbrites may be white, grey, pink, beige, brown or black - depending on their composition and density. Many pale ignimbrites are [[dacite|dacitic]] or [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]]. Darker-coloured ignimbrites may be densely welded [[volcanic glass]] or, less commonly, [[mafic]] in composition.\n\n==Deposition==\nThere are two main models that have been proposed to explain the deposition of ignimbrites from a pyroclastic density current, the ''en masse'' deposition and the progressive aggradation models.\n\n===''En masse'' model===\nThe ''en masse'' model was proposed by volcanologist [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Stephen Sparks]] in 1976. Sparks attributed the poor sorting in ignimbrites to [[Laminar flow|laminar]] flows of very high particle concentration. Pyroclastic flows were envisioned as being similar to debris flows, with a body undergoing laminar flow and then stopping ''en masse''. The flow would travel as a plug flow, with an essentially non-deforming mass travelling on a thin shear zone, and the ''en masse'' freezing occurs when the driving stress falls below a certain level. This would produce a massive unit with an inversely graded base.\n\nThere are several problems with the ''en masse'' model. Since ignimbrite is a deposit, its characteristics cannot completely represent the flow, and the deposit may only record the depositional process. Vertical chemical zonation in ignimbrites is interpreted as recording incremental changes in the deposition, and the zonation rarely correlates with flow unit boundaries and may occur within flow units. It has been posited that the chemical changes are recording progressive aggradation at the base of the flow from an eruption whose composition changes with time. For this to be so, the base of the flow cannot be turbulent. The instantaneous deposition of an entire body of material is not possible because displacement of the fluid is not possible instantaneously. Any displacement of the fluid would mobilize the upper part of the flow, and ''en masse'' deposition would not occur. Instantaneously cessation of the flow would cause local compression and extension, which would be evident in the form of tension cracks and small scale thrusting, which is not seen in most ignimbrites.<ref name=\"branney2002\">{{cite book|last1=Branney |first1=M.

There are two types of rheomorphic flow; post-depositional re-mobilization, and late stage viscous flow. While there is currently debate in the field of the relative importance of either mechanism, there is agreement that both mechanisms have an effect. A vertical variation in orientation of the structures is compelling evidence against post-depositional re-mobilization being responsible for the majority of the structures, but more work needs to be carried out to discover if the majority of ignimbrites have these vertical variations in order to say which process is the most common.\n\nA model based on observations at the Wall Mountain Tuff at [[Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument]] in Colorado suggests that the rheomorphic structures such as [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] and [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclasts]] were formed during laminar viscous flow as the density current comes to a halt. A change from particulate flow to a viscous fluid could cause the rapid ''en masse'' cooling in the last few meters.<ref name=\"schmincke\">{{cite journal|last1=Schmincke|first1=H.-U.|last2=Swanson|first2=D.

The glass shards (mostly brown) sometimes become welded together when the deposit is still hot, and can be deformed by flow and compaction about crystal fragments (clear).]]\nIgnimbrite is primarily composed of a matrix of volcanic ash ([[tephra]]) which is composed of shards and fragments of volcanic glass, pumice fragments, and crystals. The crystal fragments are commonly blown apart by the explosive eruption. Most are [[phenocryst]]s that grew in the magma, but some may be exotic crystals such as [[xenocryst]]s, derived from other magmas, igneous rocks, or from [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]].\n\nThe ash matrix typically contains varying amounts of pea- to cobble-sized rock fragments called lithic inclusions. They are mostly bits of older solidified volcanic debris entrained from conduit walls or from the land surface. More rarely, clasts are cognate material from the magma chamber.\n\nIf sufficiently hot when deposited, the particles in an ignimbrite may weld together, and the deposit is transformed into a [[Ignimbrite#Welding|'welded ignimbrite']], made of ''eutaxitic lapilli-tuff''.  When this happens, the pumice lapilli commonly flatten, and these appear on rock surfaces as dark lens shapes, known as [[fiamme]].  Intensely welded ignimbrite may have glassy zones near the base and top, called lower and upper 'vitrophyres', but central parts are microcrystalline ('lithoidal').\n\n== Mineralogy ==\nThe mineralogy of an ignimbrite is controlled primarily by the chemistry of the source magma.\n\nThe typical range of phenocrysts in ignimbrites are biotite, quartz, sanidine or other [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]], occasionally [[hornblende]], rarely [[pyroxene]] and in the case of [[phonolite]] tuffs, the [[feldspathoid]] minerals such as [[nepheline]] and [[leucite]].\n\nCommonly in most felsic ignimbrites the quartz polymorphs [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are usually found within the welded [[tuff]]s and [[breccia]]s. In the majority of cases, it appears that these high-temperature polymorphs of [[quartz]] occurred post-eruption as part of an autogenic post-eruptive alteration in some metastable form. Thus although tridymite and cristobalite are common minerals in ignimbrites, they may not be primary magmatic minerals.\n\n==Geochemistry==\nMost ignimbrites are silicic, with generally over 65% SiO<sub>2</sub>. The chemistry of the ignimbrites, like all felsic rocks, and the resultant mineralogy of phenocryst populations within them, is related mostly to the varying contents of sodium, potassium, calcium, the lesser amounts of iron and magnesium.\n\nSome rare ignimbrites are andesitic, and may even be formed from volatile saturated [[basalt]], where the ignimbrite would have the geochemistry of a normal basalt.\n\n== Alteration ==\nLarge hot ignimbrites can create some form of [[hydrothermal]] activity as they tend to blanket the wet [[soil]] and bury watercourses and rivers. The water from such substrates will exit the ignimbrite blanket in [[fumarole]]s, [[geyser]]s and the like, a process which may take several years, for example after the [[Novarupta]] tuff eruption. In the process of boiling off this water, the ignimbrite layer may become [[Metasomatism|metasomatised]] (altered). This tends to form chimneys and pockets of [[kaolin]]-altered rock.\n\n===Welding===\n[[File:Rock sample 8 Ignimbrite Guna Mika&#039;el.jpg|thumb|Rock sample of ignimbrite, collected at the foot of [[Mount Guna]] in Ethiopia]]\nWelding is a common form of ignimbrite alteration. There are two types of welding, primary and secondary. If the density current is sufficiently hot the particles will [[wikt:agglutinate|agglutinate]] and weld at the surface of sedimentation to form a viscous fluid; this is primary welding. If during transport and deposition the temperature is low, then the particles will not agglutinate and weld, although welding may occur later if compaction or other factors reduce the minimum welding temperature to below the temperature of the glassy particles; this is secondary welding. This secondary welding is most common and suggests that the temperature of most pyroclastic density currents is below the softening point of the particles.<ref name=\"chapin\"/>\n\nThe factor that determines whether an ignimbrite has primary welding, secondary welding or no welding is debated:\n*Different chemical compositions will lower the [[viscosity]] and enable primary weld.<ref name=\"schmincke\" />\n*There is not enough variation in the composition of primary and secondary welded ignimbrites for this to be a major factor.<ref name=\"chapin\" />\n*Cooling during transport is negligible, so if the eruption temperature is high enough then primary welding will occur. Lateral variations in degree of welding are not a result of cooling during transport.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Freundt|first1=A.|title=Formation of high-grade ignimbrites Part II.

New Zealand geologist [[Patrick Marshall]] (1869-1950) derived the term ''ignimbrite'' from \"fiery rock dust cloud\" (from the [[Latin]] ''igni-'' (fire) and ''imbri-'' (rain)). Ignimbrites form as the result of immense explosions of pyroclastic ash, [[lapilli]] and blocks flowing down the sides of volcanoes.\n\nIgnimbrites are made of a very poorly sorted mixture of [[volcanic ash]] (or [[tuff]] when [[Lithification|lithified]]) and [[pumice]] lapilli, commonly with scattered lithic fragments. The ash is composed of glass shards and crystal fragments. Ignimbrites may be loose and unconsolidated, or lithified (solidified) rock called lapilli-tuff. Near the volcanic source, ignimbrites commonly contain thick accumulations of lithic blocks, and distally, many show meter-thick accumulations of rounded cobbles of pumice.\n\nIgnimbrites may be white, grey, pink, beige, brown or black - depending on their composition and density. Many pale ignimbrites are [[dacite|dacitic]] or [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]]. Darker-coloured ignimbrites may be densely welded [[volcanic glass]] or, less commonly, [[mafic]] in composition.\n\n==Deposition==\nThere are two main models that have been proposed to explain the deposition of ignimbrites from a pyroclastic density current, the ''en masse'' deposition and the progressive aggradation models.\n\n===''En masse'' model===\nThe ''en masse'' model was proposed by volcanologist [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Stephen Sparks]] in 1976. Sparks attributed the poor sorting in ignimbrites to [[Laminar flow|laminar]] flows of very high particle concentration. Pyroclastic flows were envisioned as being similar to debris flows, with a body undergoing laminar flow and then stopping ''en masse''. The flow would travel as a plug flow, with an essentially non-deforming mass travelling on a thin shear zone, and the ''en masse'' freezing occurs when the driving stress falls below a certain level. This would produce a massive unit with an inversely graded base.\n\nThere are several problems with the ''en masse'' model. Since ignimbrite is a deposit, its characteristics cannot completely represent the flow, and the deposit may only record the depositional process. Vertical chemical zonation in ignimbrites is interpreted as recording incremental changes in the deposition, and the zonation rarely correlates with flow unit boundaries and may occur within flow units. It has been posited that the chemical changes are recording progressive aggradation at the base of the flow from an eruption whose composition changes with time. For this to be so, the base of the flow cannot be turbulent. The instantaneous deposition of an entire body of material is not possible because displacement of the fluid is not possible instantaneously. Any displacement of the fluid would mobilize the upper part of the flow, and ''en masse'' deposition would not occur. Instantaneously cessation of the flow would cause local compression and extension, which would be evident in the form of tension cracks and small scale thrusting, which is not seen in most ignimbrites.<ref name=\"branney2002\">{{cite book|last1=Branney |first1=M.

There are two types of rheomorphic flow; post-depositional re-mobilization, and late stage viscous flow. While there is currently debate in the field of the relative importance of either mechanism, there is agreement that both mechanisms have an effect. A vertical variation in orientation of the structures is compelling evidence against post-depositional re-mobilization being responsible for the majority of the structures, but more work needs to be carried out to discover if the majority of ignimbrites have these vertical variations in order to say which process is the most common.\n\nA model based on observations at the Wall Mountain Tuff at [[Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument]] in Colorado suggests that the rheomorphic structures such as [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] and [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclasts]] were formed during laminar viscous flow as the density current comes to a halt. A change from particulate flow to a viscous fluid could cause the rapid ''en masse'' cooling in the last few meters.<ref name=\"schmincke\">{{cite journal|last1=Schmincke|first1=H.-U.|last2=Swanson|first2=D.

The glass shards (mostly brown) sometimes become welded together when the deposit is still hot, and can be deformed by flow and compaction about crystal fragments (clear).]]\nIgnimbrite is primarily composed of a matrix of volcanic ash ([[tephra]]) which is composed of shards and fragments of volcanic glass, pumice fragments, and crystals. The crystal fragments are commonly blown apart by the explosive eruption. Most are [[phenocryst]]s that grew in the magma, but some may be exotic crystals such as [[xenocryst]]s, derived from other magmas, igneous rocks, or from [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]].\n\nThe ash matrix typically contains varying amounts of pea- to cobble-sized rock fragments called lithic inclusions. They are mostly bits of older solidified volcanic debris entrained from conduit walls or from the land surface. More rarely, clasts are cognate material from the magma chamber.\n\nIf sufficiently hot when deposited, the particles in an ignimbrite may weld together, and the deposit is transformed into a [[Ignimbrite#Welding|'welded ignimbrite']], made of ''eutaxitic lapilli-tuff''.  When this happens, the pumice lapilli commonly flatten, and these appear on rock surfaces as dark lens shapes, known as [[fiamme]].  Intensely welded ignimbrite may have glassy zones near the base and top, called lower and upper 'vitrophyres', but central parts are microcrystalline ('lithoidal').\n\n== Mineralogy ==\nThe mineralogy of an ignimbrite is controlled primarily by the chemistry of the source magma.\n\nThe typical range of phenocrysts in ignimbrites are biotite, quartz, sanidine or other [[feldspar|alkali feldspar]], occasionally [[hornblende]], rarely [[pyroxene]] and in the case of [[phonolite]] tuffs, the [[feldspathoid]] minerals such as [[nepheline]] and [[leucite]].\n\nCommonly in most felsic ignimbrites the quartz polymorphs [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are usually found within the welded [[tuff]]s and [[breccia]]s. In the majority of cases, it appears that these high-temperature polymorphs of [[quartz]] occurred post-eruption as part of an autogenic post-eruptive alteration in some metastable form. Thus although tridymite and cristobalite are common minerals in ignimbrites, they may not be primary magmatic minerals.\n\n==Geochemistry==\nMost ignimbrites are silicic, with generally over 65% SiO<sub>2</sub>. The chemistry of the ignimbrites, like all felsic rocks, and the resultant mineralogy of phenocryst populations within them, is related mostly to the varying contents of sodium, potassium, calcium, the lesser amounts of iron and magnesium.\n\nSome rare ignimbrites are andesitic, and may even be formed from volatile saturated [[basalt]], where the ignimbrite would have the geochemistry of a normal basalt.\n\n== Alteration ==\nLarge hot ignimbrites can create some form of [[hydrothermal]] activity as they tend to blanket the wet [[soil]] and bury watercourses and rivers. The water from such substrates will exit the ignimbrite blanket in [[fumarole]]s, [[geyser]]s and the like, a process which may take several years, for example after the [[Novarupta]] tuff eruption. In the process of boiling off this water, the ignimbrite layer may become [[Metasomatism|metasomatised]] (altered). This tends to form chimneys and pockets of [[kaolin]]-altered rock.\n\n===Welding===\n[[File:Rock sample 8 Ignimbrite Guna Mika&#039;el.jpg|thumb|Rock sample of ignimbrite, collected at the foot of [[Mount Guna]] in Ethiopia]]\nWelding is a common form of ignimbrite alteration. There are two types of welding, primary and secondary. If the density current is sufficiently hot the particles will [[wikt:agglutinate|agglutinate]] and weld at the surface of sedimentation to form a viscous fluid; this is primary welding. If during transport and deposition the temperature is low, then the particles will not agglutinate and weld, although welding may occur later if compaction or other factors reduce the minimum welding temperature to below the temperature of the glassy particles; this is secondary welding. This secondary welding is most common and suggests that the temperature of most pyroclastic density currents is below the softening point of the particles.<ref name=\"chapin\"/>\n\nThe factor that determines whether an ignimbrite has primary welding, secondary welding or no welding is debated:\n*Different chemical compositions will lower the [[viscosity]] and enable primary weld.<ref name=\"schmincke\" />\n*There is not enough variation in the composition of primary and secondary welded ignimbrites for this to be a major factor.<ref name=\"chapin\" />\n*Cooling during transport is negligible, so if the eruption temperature is high enough then primary welding will occur.
