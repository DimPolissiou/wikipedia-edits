It is the most populous municipality in [[Northwestern Ontario]] with a population of 107,909 as of the [[Canada 2016 Census]], and the second most populous in [[Northern Ontario]] after [[Greater Sudbury]]. Located on [[Lake Superior]], the [[census metropolitan area]] of Thunder Bay has a population of 121,621, and consists of the city of Thunder Bay, the municipalities of [[Oliver Paipoonge]] and [[Neebing, Ontario|Neebing]], the townships of [[Shuniah]], [[Conmee, Ontario|Conmee]], [[O'Connor, Ontario|O'Connor]], and [[Gillies, Ontario|Gillies]], and the [[Fort William First Nation]].\n\nEuropean settlement in the region began in the late 17th century with a French [[fur trading]] outpost on the banks of the [[Kaministiquia River]].<ref name=\"TBHistory\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022160858/http://www.thunderbay.ca/index.cfm?fuse=html&pg=313 Brief History of Thunder Bay], City of Thunder Bay.

[[Forestry]] and [[manufacturing]] played important roles in the city's economy. They have declined in recent years, but have been replaced by a \"[[knowledge economy]]\" based on [[medical research]] and education. Thunder Bay is the site of the Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute.\n\nThe city takes its name from the immense [[Thunder Bay (Ontario landform)|Thunder Bay]] at the head of Lake Superior, known on 18th-century French maps as ''Baie du Tonnerre'' (Bay of Thunder).<ref name=\"TBHistory\"/> The city is often referred to as the \"Lakehead\", or \"Canadian Lakehead\", because of its location at the end of Great Lakes navigation on the Canadian side of the border.<ref name=\"Lakehead\">Tronrud, Thorold J; Epp, Ernest A.; and others.

In 1803, the Montreal-based [[North West Company]] established Fort William as its mid-continent ''entrep\u00f4t''. The fort thrived until 1821 when the North West Company merged with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and Fort William was no longer needed.\n\n[[File:Fort William 1865.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Fort William in 1865]]\nBy the 1850s, the [[Province of Canada]] began to take an interest in its western extremity. Discovery of [[copper]] in the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] of Michigan had prompted a national demand for [[mining]] locations on the Canadian shores of Lake Superior. In 1849, French-speaking [[Jesuits]] established the ''Mission de l'Immacul\u00e9e-Conception'' (Mission of the Immaculate Conception) on the [[Kaministiquia River|Kaministiquia]] to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] the [[Ojibwe]]. The Province of Canada negotiated the [[Robinson Treaty]] in 1850 with the Ojibwa of Lake Superior. As a result, an Indian reserve was set aside for them south of the Kaministiquia River. In 1859\u201360, the Department of Crown Lands surveyed two townships (Neebing and Paipoonge) and the Town Plot of Fort William for European-Canadian settlement.\n\nAnother settlement developed a few miles to the north of Fort William after construction by the federal Department of Public Works of a road connecting Lake Superior with the [[Red River Colony]]. The work was directed by [[Simon James Dawson]] (see [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]). This public works depot or construction headquarters acquired its first name in May 1870 when Colonel [[Garnet Wolseley]] named it Prince Arthur's Landing. It was renamed Port Arthur by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) in May 1883.<ref>F.B. Scollie, \"Falling into Line : How Prince Arthur's Landing Became Port Arthur,\" Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society ''Papers and Records'', XIII (1985) 8\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the CPR in 1875 sparked a long rivalry between the towns, which did not end until their amalgamation in 1970. Until the 1880s, Port Arthur was a much larger and dynamic community. The CPR, in collaboration with the Hudson's Bay Company, preferred east Fort William, located on the lower Kaministiquia River where the fur trade posts were. Provoked by a prolonged tax dispute with Port Arthur and its seizure of a [[locomotive]] in 1889, the CPR relocated all its employees and facilities to Fort William. The collapse of [[silver mining]] after 1890 undermined the economy of Port Arthur. It had an economic depression, while Fort William thrived.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:T-bay Railway Station.jpg|thumb|CN Railway Station]]\nIn the era of [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfried Laurier]], Thunder Bay began a period of extraordinary growth, based on improved access to markets via the [[transcontinental railway]] and development of the western [[wheat]] boom. The CPR double-tracked its Winnipeg\u2013Thunder Bay line. The [[Canadian Northern Railway]] established facilities at Port Arthur. The [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] began construction of its facilities at the Fort William Mission in 1905, and the federal government began construction of the [[National Transcontinental Railway]]. [[Grain elevator]] construction boomed as the volume of grain shipped to Europe increased. Both cities incurred debt to grant bonuses to manufacturing industries.\n\nBy 1914, the twin cities had modern infrastructures (sewers, potable water supply, street lighting, electric light, etc.) Both Fort William and Port Arthur were proponents of municipal ownership. As early as 1892, Port Arthur built Canada's first municipally-owned electric street railway. Both cities spurned [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company of Canada]] to establish their own municipally-owned telephone systems in 1902.\n\nThe boom came to an end in 1913\u20131914, aggravated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. A war-time economy emerged with the making of munitions and shipbuilding. Men from the cities joined the 52nd, 94th, and 141st Battalions of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nRailway employment was hurt when the federal government took over the [[National Transcontinental Railway]] and Lake Superior Division from the Grand Trunk in 1915, and the Canadian Northern Railway in 1918. These were amalgamated with other government-owned railways in 1923 to form the [[Canadian National Railways]]. The CNR closed many of the Canadian Northern Railway facilities in Port Arthur. It opened the Neebing yards in Neebing Township in 1922. By 1929, the population of the two cities had recovered to pre-war levels.\n\nThe [[Forest product|forest products industry]] has played an important role in the Thunder Bay economy from the 1870s. In the 1880s, [[Herman Finger]] established the [[Pigeon River Lumber Company]] in the area, and also built the [[Gunflint and Lake Superior Railroad]], but he dissolved the lumber company and moved his operations to The Pas by 1919.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/internal_reports/pdfs/Lumber_Industry_Mb_Nicholson.pdf|title=The Lumber Industry in Manitoba|last=Nicholson|first=Karen|date=February 2000|website=Manitoba Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport - Historic Resources Branch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 26, 2019}}</ref> Logs and lumber were shipped primarily to the United States. In 1917, the first pulp and paper mill was established in Port Arthur. It was followed by a mill at Fort William, in 1920. Eventually there were four mills operating.\n\nManufacturing resumed in 1937 when the Canada Car and Foundry Company plant (opened during late World War I to produce naval ships and railcars) re-opened to build aircraft for the British. Now run by [[Bombardier Transportation]], the plant has remained a mainstay of the post-war economy. It has produced forestry equipment and transportation equipment for urban transit systems, such as the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] and [[GO Transit]].\n\n===Amalgamation===\nOn 1 January 1970, the City of Thunder Bay was formed through the merger of the cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], and the geographic townships of Neebing and McIntyre.<ref name=\"TBHistory\"/> Its name was the result of a [[referendum]] held previously on 23 June 1969, to determine the new name of the amalgamated Fort William and Port Arthur. Officials debated over the names to be put on the ballot, taking suggestions from residents including \"Lakehead\" and \"The Lakehead\". Predictably, [[Vote splitting|the vote split between the two]], and \"Thunder Bay\" was the victor. The final tally was \"Thunder Bay\" with 15,870, \"Lakehead\" with 15,302, and \"The Lakehead\" with 8,377.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121412/http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/1012.pdf About Thunder Bay], pp. 2. Retrieved 2 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThere was more controversy over the selection of a name for the amalgamated city than over whether to amalgamate. A vocal minority of the population preferred \"The Lakehead\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/CEDC/docs/Thunder_Bay_Overview+-+opens+a+new+window.pdf |title=The City of Thunder Bay |access-date=5 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100254/http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/CEDC/docs/Thunder_Bay_Overview+-+opens+a+new+window.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There was much discussion about other cities in the world that use the word \"The\" in their names. The area was often referred to as \"The Lakehead\" before and after amalgamation based on its geographic location. It was seen as the \"head\" of shipping on the Great Lakes and the \"rail head\".\n\nThe expansion of highways, beginning with the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] and culminating with the opening of [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway 17]] (linking Sault Ste Marie to Thunder Bay in 1960), has significantly diminished railway and shipping activity since the 1970s and 80s. Shipping on the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] was superseded by trucking on highways. Grain shipping on the Great Lakes to the East has declined substantially in favour of transport to Pacific Coast ports. As a result, many grain elevators have been closed and demolished. The Kaministiquia River was abandoned by industry and shipping.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Today===\nThunder Bay has become the regional services centre for [[Northwestern Ontario]] with most provincial departments represented. [[Lakehead University]], established through the lobbying of local businesspeople and professionals, has proven to be a major asset. Another upper level institution is [[Confederation College]]. The same businessmen and professionals who helped attract the university and college were the driving force(s) behind the political amalgamation of Fort William and Port Arthur in 1970.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Thunder Bay NASA.jpg|thumb|Fort William as seen from the [[International Space Station]], December 2008]]\n[[File:ISS053-E-223431.jpg|thumb|Thunder Bay is the brightly lit city along the top of Lake Superior, taken at 1:58 AM on November 10, 2017, during ISS [[Expedition 53]].]]\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|328.48|km2|mi2}}, which includes the former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur, as well as the former townships of Neebing and McIntyre. The city reflects the settlement patterns of the 19th century and sprawls. Anchoring the west end of the city, the Fort William Town Plot, surveyed in 1859\u201360, was named West Fort William (or Westfort) in 1888 by the CPR. The land adjoining the lower Kaministiquia River became the residential and central business district of the town and city of Fort William. A large uninhabited area adjoining the Neebing and McIntyre rivers, which became known as Intercity, separated Fort William from the residential and central business district of Port Arthur. At the extreme east of the city, a part of McIntyre Township was annexed to the town of Port Arthur in 1892, forming what later became known as the Current River area.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe former Port Arthur section is more typical of the [[Canadian Shield]], with gently sloping hills and very thin soil lying on top of bedrock with many bare outcrops. [[Thunder Bay (Ontario landform)|Thunder Bay]], which gives the city its name, is about {{convert|22.5|km|mi}} from the Port Arthur downtown to Thunder Cape at the tip of the [[Sleeping Giant (Ontario)|Sleeping Giant]]. The former Fort William section occupies flat [[alluvial]] land along the Kaministiquia River. In the [[river delta]] are two large islands: Mission Island and McKellar Island. Since 1970, the central business districts of Fort William and Port Arthur have suffered a serious decline.  Business and government relocated to new developments in the Intercity area. There has also been substantial residential growth in adjacent areas of the former Neebing and McIntyre townships.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe Thunder Bay area experiences a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfb'') and a [[Subarctic climate|continental subarctic]] (''Dfc'') influence in northeastern areas of the city (including that affected by [[Lake Superior]]), but not necessarily falling in this zone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peel |first1=Murray C. |title=World Map of Koppen-Geiger climate classification |url=http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/Koppen/World_Koppen_Map.png |publisher=The [[University of Melbourne]] |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-canada.php|title=Interactive Canada Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>  This results in warmer summer (or cooler) temperatures and warmer winter temperatures for an area extending inland as far as 16&nbsp;km.

It is the most populous municipality in [[Northwestern Ontario]] with a population of 107,909 as of the [[Canada 2016 Census]], and the second most populous in [[Northern Ontario]] after [[Greater Sudbury]]. Located on [[Lake Superior]], the [[census metropolitan area]] of Thunder Bay has a population of 121,621, and consists of the city of Thunder Bay, the municipalities of [[Oliver Paipoonge]] and [[Neebing, Ontario|Neebing]], the townships of [[Shuniah]], [[Conmee, Ontario|Conmee]], [[O'Connor, Ontario|O'Connor]], and [[Gillies, Ontario|Gillies]], and the [[Fort William First Nation]].\n\nEuropean settlement in the region began in the late 17th century with a French [[fur trading]] outpost on the banks of the [[Kaministiquia River]].<ref name=\"TBHistory\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022160858/http://www.thunderbay.ca/index.cfm?fuse=html&pg=313 Brief History of Thunder Bay], City of Thunder Bay. Retrieved 5 June 2007.</ref> It grew into an important transportation hub with its port forming an important link in the shipping of [[grain]] and other products from [[western Canada]], through the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the east coast. [[Forestry]] and [[manufacturing]] played important roles in the city's economy. They have declined in recent years, but have been replaced by a \"[[knowledge economy]]\" based on [[medical research]] and education. Thunder Bay is the site of the Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute.\n\nThe city takes its name from the immense [[Thunder Bay (Ontario landform)|Thunder Bay]] at the head of Lake Superior, known on 18th-century French maps as ''Baie du Tonnerre'' (Bay of Thunder).<ref name=\"TBHistory\"/> The city is often referred to as the \"Lakehead\", or \"Canadian Lakehead\", because of its location at the end of Great Lakes navigation on the Canadian side of the border.<ref name=\"Lakehead\">Tronrud, Thorold J; Epp, Ernest A.; and others.

In 1803, the Montreal-based [[North West Company]] established Fort William as its mid-continent ''entrep\u00f4t''. The fort thrived until 1821 when the North West Company merged with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and Fort William was no longer needed.\n\n[[File:Fort William 1865.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Fort William in 1865]]\nBy the 1850s, the [[Province of Canada]] began to take an interest in its western extremity. Discovery of [[copper]] in the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] of Michigan had prompted a national demand for [[mining]] locations on the Canadian shores of Lake Superior. In 1849, French-speaking [[Jesuits]] established the ''Mission de l'Immacul\u00e9e-Conception'' (Mission of the Immaculate Conception) on the [[Kaministiquia River|Kaministiquia]] to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] the [[Ojibwe]]. The Province of Canada negotiated the [[Robinson Treaty]] in 1850 with the Ojibwa of Lake Superior. As a result, an Indian reserve was set aside for them south of the Kaministiquia River. In 1859\u201360, the Department of Crown Lands surveyed two townships (Neebing and Paipoonge) and the Town Plot of Fort William for European-Canadian settlement.\n\nAnother settlement developed a few miles to the north of Fort William after construction by the federal Department of Public Works of a road connecting Lake Superior with the [[Red River Colony]]. The work was directed by [[Simon James Dawson]] (see [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]). This public works depot or construction headquarters acquired its first name in May 1870 when Colonel [[Garnet Wolseley]] named it Prince Arthur's Landing. It was renamed Port Arthur by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) in May 1883.<ref>F.B. Scollie, \"Falling into Line : How Prince Arthur's Landing Became Port Arthur,\" Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society ''Papers and Records'', XIII (1985) 8\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the CPR in 1875 sparked a long rivalry between the towns, which did not end until their amalgamation in 1970. Until the 1880s, Port Arthur was a much larger and dynamic community. The CPR, in collaboration with the Hudson's Bay Company, preferred east Fort William, located on the lower Kaministiquia River where the fur trade posts were. Provoked by a prolonged tax dispute with Port Arthur and its seizure of a [[locomotive]] in 1889, the CPR relocated all its employees and facilities to Fort William. The collapse of [[silver mining]] after 1890 undermined the economy of Port Arthur. It had an economic depression, while Fort William thrived.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:T-bay Railway Station.jpg|thumb|CN Railway Station]]\nIn the era of [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfried Laurier]], Thunder Bay began a period of extraordinary growth, based on improved access to markets via the [[transcontinental railway]] and development of the western [[wheat]] boom. The CPR double-tracked its Winnipeg\u2013Thunder Bay line. The [[Canadian Northern Railway]] established facilities at Port Arthur. The [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] began construction of its facilities at the Fort William Mission in 1905, and the federal government began construction of the [[National Transcontinental Railway]]. [[Grain elevator]] construction boomed as the volume of grain shipped to Europe increased. Both cities incurred debt to grant bonuses to manufacturing industries.\n\nBy 1914, the twin cities had modern infrastructures (sewers, potable water supply, street lighting, electric light, etc.) Both Fort William and Port Arthur were proponents of municipal ownership. As early as 1892, Port Arthur built Canada's first municipally-owned electric street railway. Both cities spurned [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company of Canada]] to establish their own municipally-owned telephone systems in 1902.\n\nThe boom came to an end in 1913\u20131914, aggravated by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. A war-time economy emerged with the making of munitions and shipbuilding. Men from the cities joined the 52nd, 94th, and 141st Battalions of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].\n\nRailway employment was hurt when the federal government took over the [[National Transcontinental Railway]] and Lake Superior Division from the Grand Trunk in 1915, and the Canadian Northern Railway in 1918. These were amalgamated with other government-owned railways in 1923 to form the [[Canadian National Railways]]. The CNR closed many of the Canadian Northern Railway facilities in Port Arthur. It opened the Neebing yards in Neebing Township in 1922. By 1929, the population of the two cities had recovered to pre-war levels.\n\nThe [[Forest product|forest products industry]] has played an important role in the Thunder Bay economy from the 1870s. In the 1880s, [[Herman Finger]] established the [[Pigeon River Lumber Company]] in the area, and also built the [[Gunflint and Lake Superior Railroad]], but he dissolved the lumber company and moved his operations to The Pas by 1919.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/internal_reports/pdfs/Lumber_Industry_Mb_Nicholson.pdf|title=The Lumber Industry in Manitoba|last=Nicholson|first=Karen|date=February 2000|website=Manitoba Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport - Historic Resources Branch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 26, 2019}}</ref> Logs and lumber were shipped primarily to the United States. In 1917, the first pulp and paper mill was established in Port Arthur. It was followed by a mill at Fort William, in 1920. Eventually there were four mills operating.\n\nManufacturing resumed in 1937 when the Canada Car and Foundry Company plant (opened during late World War I to produce naval ships and railcars) re-opened to build aircraft for the British. Now run by [[Bombardier Transportation]], the plant has remained a mainstay of the post-war economy. It has produced forestry equipment and transportation equipment for urban transit systems, such as the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] and [[GO Transit]].\n\n===Amalgamation===\nOn 1 January 1970, the City of Thunder Bay was formed through the merger of the cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], and the geographic townships of Neebing and McIntyre.<ref name=\"TBHistory\"/> Its name was the result of a [[referendum]] held previously on 23 June 1969, to determine the new name of the amalgamated Fort William and Port Arthur. Officials debated over the names to be put on the ballot, taking suggestions from residents including \"Lakehead\" and \"The Lakehead\". Predictably, [[Vote splitting|the vote split between the two]], and \"Thunder Bay\" was the victor. The final tally was \"Thunder Bay\" with 15,870, \"Lakehead\" with 15,302, and \"The Lakehead\" with 8,377.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121412/http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/1012.pdf About Thunder Bay], pp. 2. Retrieved 2 September 2007.</ref>\n\nThere was more controversy over the selection of a name for the amalgamated city than over whether to amalgamate. A vocal minority of the population preferred \"The Lakehead\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/CEDC/docs/Thunder_Bay_Overview+-+opens+a+new+window.pdf |title=The City of Thunder Bay |access-date=5 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100254/http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/CEDC/docs/Thunder_Bay_Overview+-+opens+a+new+window.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There was much discussion about other cities in the world that use the word \"The\" in their names. The area was often referred to as \"The Lakehead\" before and after amalgamation based on its geographic location. It was seen as the \"head\" of shipping on the Great Lakes and the \"rail head\".\n\nThe expansion of highways, beginning with the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] and culminating with the opening of [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway 17]] (linking Sault Ste Marie to Thunder Bay in 1960), has significantly diminished railway and shipping activity since the 1970s and 80s. Shipping on the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] was superseded by trucking on highways. Grain shipping on the Great Lakes to the East has declined substantially in favour of transport to Pacific Coast ports. As a result, many grain elevators have been closed and demolished. The Kaministiquia River was abandoned by industry and shipping.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Today===\nThunder Bay has become the regional services centre for [[Northwestern Ontario]] with most provincial departments represented. [[Lakehead University]], established through the lobbying of local businesspeople and professionals, has proven to be a major asset. Another upper level institution is [[Confederation College]]. The same businessmen and professionals who helped attract the university and college were the driving force(s) behind the political amalgamation of Fort William and Port Arthur in 1970.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Thunder Bay NASA.jpg|thumb|Fort William as seen from the [[International Space Station]], December 2008]]\n[[File:ISS053-E-223431.jpg|thumb|Thunder Bay is the brightly lit city along the top of Lake Superior, taken at 1:58 AM on November 10, 2017, during ISS [[Expedition 53]].]]\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|328.48|km2|mi2}}, which includes the former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur, as well as the former townships of Neebing and McIntyre. The city reflects the settlement patterns of the 19th century and sprawls. Anchoring the west end of the city, the Fort William Town Plot, surveyed in 1859\u201360, was named West Fort William (or Westfort) in 1888 by the CPR. The land adjoining the lower Kaministiquia River became the residential and central business district of the town and city of Fort William. A large uninhabited area adjoining the Neebing and McIntyre rivers, which became known as Intercity, separated Fort William from the residential and central business district of Port Arthur. At the extreme east of the city, a part of McIntyre Township was annexed to the town of Port Arthur in 1892, forming what later became known as the Current River area.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe former Port Arthur section is more typical of the [[Canadian Shield]], with gently sloping hills and very thin soil lying on top of bedrock with many bare outcrops. [[Thunder Bay (Ontario landform)|Thunder Bay]], which gives the city its name, is about {{convert|22.5|km|mi}} from the Port Arthur downtown to Thunder Cape at the tip of the [[Sleeping Giant (Ontario)|Sleeping Giant]]. The former Fort William section occupies flat [[alluvial]] land along the Kaministiquia River. In the [[river delta]] are two large islands: Mission Island and McKellar Island. Since 1970, the central business districts of Fort William and Port Arthur have suffered a serious decline.  Business and government relocated to new developments in the Intercity area. There has also been substantial residential growth in adjacent areas of the former Neebing and McIntyre townships.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe Thunder Bay area experiences a warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfb'') and a [[Subarctic climate|continental subarctic]] (''Dfc'') influence in northeastern areas of the city (including that affected by [[Lake Superior]]), but not necessarily falling in this zone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peel |first1=Murray C. |title=World Map of Koppen-Geiger climate classification |url=http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/Koppen/World_Koppen_Map.png |publisher=The [[University of Melbourne]] |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-canada.php|title=Interactive Canada Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>  This results in warmer summer (or cooler) temperatures and warmer winter temperatures for an area extending inland as far as 16&nbsp;km.

He is most famous for his [[:Category:Xanth books|long-running novel series]] set in the [[fictional realm]] of [[Xanth]].\n\nMany of his books have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. He has stated that one of his greatest achievements has been to publish a book beginning with every letter of the alphabet, from ''Anthonology'' to ''[[Zombie Lover]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nAnthony's parents, Alfred and Norma Jacob, were [[Quaker]] pacifists studying at Oxford University who interrupted their studies in 1936 to undertake relief work on behalf of the Quakers during the [[Spanish Civil War]], establishing a food kitchen for children in Barcelona.<ref>Maul, Daniel. \"The Politics of Neutrality: the American Friends Service Committee and the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939\", ''European Review of History: Revue europ\u00e9enne d'histoire'', 23:1-2 (2016), p. 82-100.</ref> Piers and his sister were left in England in the care of their maternal grandparents and a nanny.<ref>Anthony, Piers.

''Almost Utopia'', Vermont Historical Society, 2008.</ref> Both parents resumed their academic studies, and Alfred eventually became a professor of Romance languages, teaching at a number of colleges in the Philadelphia area.\n\nPiers was moved around to a number of schools, eventually enrolling in [[Goddard College]] in [[Vermont]] where he graduated in 1956.<ref>Anthony, Piers.

They were married in 1956, the same year he graduated from [[Goddard College]]. After a series of odd jobs, Anthony decided to join the U.S. Army in 1957 for a steady source of income and medical coverage for his pregnant wife. He would stay in the Army until 1959 and became a US citizen during this time. While in the army, he became an editor and cartoonist for the battalion newspaper. After leaving the army, he spent a brief stint as a public school teacher before trying his hand at becoming a full-time writer.\n\nAnthony and his wife made a deal: if he could sell a piece of writing within one year, she would continue to work to support him. But if he could not sell anything in that year, then he would forever give up his dream of being a writer. At the end of the year, he managed to get a short story published. He credits his wife as the person who made his writing career possible, and he advises aspiring writers that they need to have a source of income other than their writing in order to get through the early years of a writing career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anthony|first=Piers|title=Anthonology|year=1985|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-312-93027-1|edition=1st|page=[https://archive.org/details/anthonology00anth/page/10 10]|type=Hardcover|chapter=Introduction to the story \"Possible to Rue\"|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/anthonology00anth/page/10}}</ref>\n\nCarol Ann Marble Jacob died at home 3 October 2019 due to what is suspected to be heart related complications due to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).\n\n==Writing==\nOn multiple occasions Anthony has moved from one publisher to another (taking a profitable hit series with him) when he says he felt the editors were unduly tampering with his work.

The same series also spawned the board game ''Xanth'' by [[Mayfair Games]].\n\nAnthony's novels usually end with a chapter-long Author's Note, in which he talks about himself, his life, and his experiences as they related to the process of writing the novel. He often discusses correspondence with readers and any real-world issues that influenced the novel.\n\nSince about 2000, Anthony has written his novels in a [[Linux]] environment.<ref>Howell, Dean.

The act is written and narrated by writer Logan Hill who, as a 12-year-old, was consumed with reading Anthony's novels. For a decade he felt he must have been Anthony's number one fan, until, when he was 22, he met \"Andy\" at a wedding and discovered their mutual interest in the writer. Andy is interviewed for the story and explains that, as a teenager, he had used escapist novels in order to cope with his alienating school and home life in [[Buffalo, New York]]. In 1987, at age 15, he decided to run away to Florida in order to try to live with Piers Anthony. The story includes Anthony's reflections on these events.<ref name=tal/>\n\n[[Naomi King]], the daughter of writer [[Stephen King]], enjoyed reading books by Piers Anthony, which included things like pixies, imps and fairies. After she told her father, \"Dad, I just don't like those to be scared. Would you write something with dragons in it?\", he wrote ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which was originally published in 1984 and later in 1987 by [[Viking Press]].\n\n==''But What of Earth?''==\nEarly in Anthony's literary career, there was a dispute surrounding the original publication (1976) of ''But What of Earth?''.  Editor [[Roger Elwood]] commissioned the novel for his nascent science-fiction line [[Laser Books]]. According to Anthony, he completed ''But What of Earth?'', and Elwood accepted and purchased it. Elwood then told Anthony that he wished to make several minor changes, and in order not to waste Anthony's time, he had hired copy editor (and author) [[Robert Coulson]] to retype the manuscript with the changes. Anthony described Coulson as a friend and was initially open to his contribution.\n\nHowever, Elwood told Coulson he was to be a full collaborator, free to make revisions to Anthony's text in line with suggestions made by other copy editors. Elwood promised Coulson a 50-50 split with Anthony on all future royalties.

Bio of an Ogre, Ace Books, 1988. p 5</ref> is an [[English-American]] author in the [[science fiction]] and [[Fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] genres, publishing under the name '''Piers Anthony'''. He is most famous for his [[:Category:Xanth books|long-running novel series]] set in the [[fictional realm]] of [[Xanth]].\n\nMany of his books have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. He has stated that one of his greatest achievements has been to publish a book beginning with every letter of the alphabet, from ''Anthonology'' to ''[[Zombie Lover]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nAnthony's parents, Alfred and Norma Jacob, were [[Quaker]] pacifists studying at Oxford University who interrupted their studies in 1936 to undertake relief work on behalf of the Quakers during the [[Spanish Civil War]], establishing a food kitchen for children in Barcelona.<ref>Maul, Daniel. \"The Politics of Neutrality: the American Friends Service Committee and the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939\", ''European Review of History: Revue europ\u00e9enne d'histoire'', 23:1-2 (2016), p. 82-100.</ref> Piers and his sister were left in England in the care of their maternal grandparents and a nanny.<ref>Anthony, Piers.

In 1941 the family settled in a rustic \"back to the land\" [[utopian]] community near [[Winhall, Vermont]], where a young Piers made the acquaintance of radical author [[Scott Nearing]], a neighbor.<ref>Joly, Greg and Rebecca Lepkoff. ''Almost Utopia'', Vermont Historical Society, 2008.</ref> Both parents resumed their academic studies, and Alfred eventually became a professor of Romance languages, teaching at a number of colleges in the Philadelphia area.\n\nPiers was moved around to a number of schools, eventually enrolling in [[Goddard College]] in [[Vermont]] where he graduated in 1956.<ref>Anthony, Piers. Bio of an Ogre, Ace Books, 1988. p. 87</ref> On ''[[This American Life]]'' on 27 July 2012, Anthony revealed that his parents had divorced, he was bullied, and he had poor grades in school. Anthony referred to his high school as a \"very fancy private school\", and refuses to donate money to the school because as a student, he recalls being part of \"the lower crust\", and that no one paid attention to or cared about him.  He said, \"I didn't like being a member of the underclass, of the peons like that\".<ref name=tal>{{cite episode | url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/470/show-me-the-way | transcript=Transcript | transcripturl=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/470/transcript | series=[[This American Life]] | title=470: Show Me The Way | date=27 July 2012 | accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref>  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen while serving in the [[United States Army]] in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |last=Denney |first=Jim |authorlink= |title=Quit Your Day Job!: How to Sleep Late, Do What You Enjoy, and Make a Ton of Money as a Writer! |publisher=Quill Driver Books |year=2003 |page=24 |isbn=978-1-884956-04-1}}</ref> After completing a two-year stint in military service, he briefly taught school at [[Admiral Farragut Academy]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] before becoming a full-time writer.<ref>Anthony, Piers.

They were married in 1956, the same year he graduated from [[Goddard College]]. After a series of odd jobs, Anthony decided to join the U.S. Army in 1957 for a steady source of income and medical coverage for his pregnant wife. He would stay in the Army until 1959 and became a US citizen during this time. While in the army, he became an editor and cartoonist for the battalion newspaper. After leaving the army, he spent a brief stint as a public school teacher before trying his hand at becoming a full-time writer.\n\nAnthony and his wife made a deal: if he could sell a piece of writing within one year, she would continue to work to support him. But if he could not sell anything in that year, then he would forever give up his dream of being a writer. At the end of the year, he managed to get a short story published. He credits his wife as the person who made his writing career possible, and he advises aspiring writers that they need to have a source of income other than their writing in order to get through the early years of a writing career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anthony|first=Piers|title=Anthonology|year=1985|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-312-93027-1|edition=1st|page=[https://archive.org/details/anthonology00anth/page/10 10]|type=Hardcover|chapter=Introduction to the story \"Possible to Rue\"|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/anthonology00anth/page/10}}</ref>\n\nCarol Ann Marble Jacob died at home 3 October 2019 due to what is suspected to be heart related complications due to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).\n\n==Writing==\nOn multiple occasions Anthony has moved from one publisher to another (taking a profitable hit series with him) when he says he felt the editors were unduly tampering with his work.

The series also spawned the board game ''Xanth'' by [[Mayfair Games]].\n\nAnthony's novels usually end with a chapter-long Author's Note, in which he talks about himself, his life, and his experiences as they related to the process of writing the novel. He often discusses correspondence with readers and any real-world issues that influenced the novel.\n\nSince about 2000, Anthony has written his novels in a [[Linux]] environment.<ref>Howell, Dean.

The act is written and narrated by writer Logan Hill who, as a 12-year-old, was consumed with reading Anthony's novels. For a decade he felt he must have been Anthony's number one fan, until, when he was 22, he met \"Andy\" at a wedding and discovered their mutual interest in the writer. Andy is interviewed for the story and explains that, as a teenager, he had used escapist novels in order to cope with his alienating school and home life in [[Buffalo, New York]]. In 1987, at age 15, he decided to run away to Florida in order to try to live with Piers Anthony. The story includes Anthony's reflections on these events.<ref name=tal/>\n\n[[Naomi King]], the daughter of writer [[Stephen King]], enjoyed reading books by Piers Anthony, which included things like pixies, imps and fairies. After she told her father, \"Dad, I just don't like those to be scared. Would you write something with dragons in it?\", he wrote ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which was originally published in 1984 and later in 1987 by [[Viking Press]].\n\n==''But What of Earth?''==\nEarly in Anthony's literary career, there was a dispute surrounding the original publication (1976) of ''But What of Earth?''.  Editor [[Roger Elwood]] commissioned the novel for his nascent science-fiction line [[Laser Books]]. According to Anthony, he completed ''But What of Earth?'', and Elwood accepted and purchased it. Elwood then told Anthony that he wished to make several minor changes, and in order not to waste Anthony's time, he had hired copy editor (and author) [[Robert Coulson]] to retype the manuscript with the changes. Anthony described Coulson as a friend and was initially open to his contribution.\n\nHowever, Elwood told Coulson he was to be a full collaborator, free to make revisions to Anthony's text in line with suggestions made by other copy editors. Elwood promised Coulson a 50-50 split with Anthony on all future royalties. According to Anthony, the published novel was very different from his version, with changes to characters and dialog, and with scenes added and removed. Anthony felt the changes worsened the novel. Laser's ultimate publication of ''But What of Earth?'' listed Anthony and Coulson together as collaborators. Publication rights were reverted to Anthony under threat of legal action. In 1989, Anthony (re)published his original ''But What of Earth?'' in an annotated edition through [[Tor Books]]. This edition contains an introduction and conclusion setting out the story of the novel's permutations and roughly 60 pages of notes by Anthony giving examples of changes to plot and characters, and describing some of the comments made by copy editors on his manuscript.<ref>{{cite book | first=Piers | last=Anthony | title=But What of Earth? | date=15 July 1989 | isbn=978-0812530988 | url=https://archive.org/details/butwhatofearth00pier }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAnthony currently lives on a [[tree farm]] which he owns in Florida.
