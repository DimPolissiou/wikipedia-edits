According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nSanta Cruz is situated on the banks of the [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] which flows into the eastern part of [[Laguna de Bay]]. The town is bounded by the Bay on the north, by Lumban and Pagsanjan towns in the east, Pagsanjan and Magdalena towns in the south, and Pila in the west. It is {{convert|88|km}} from Manila via Calamba and Los Ba\u00f1os. It is accessible by land from Metro Manila passing through [[Rizal Province]] via [[Manila East Road]] or via [[South Luzon Expressway]]\n\nSanta Cruz is considered as the service and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. The town is composed of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. Although relatively far from the immediate urbanizing influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz continues to progress. It is now classified as first class municipality. The present administration is headed by the Mayor Egay San Luis. Santa Cruz is also the seat of the provincial government since 1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. Boosting the economy of the municipality are the incipient and fast-growing agribusiness industries such as livestock raising, horticulture and aquaculture. The town is composed of twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are being classified as urban.\n\nThe development of Santa Cruz as the administrative, commercial, and service center of Laguna makes it accessible for all private/public vehicles going to nearby places particularly [[Pagsanjan, Laguna|Pagsanjan]], [[Lake Caliraya]], [[Liliw, Laguna|Liliw]], [[Paete, Laguna|Paete]] and [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the last decade of the 16th century, Santa Cruz was once a well populated barrio of the present municipality of [[Lumban]], as well as other contemporary towns like [[Pagsanjan]], [[Cavinti]], [[Paete]] and [[Pangil]]. On June 4, 1602, Santa Cruz separated from Lumban and became a pueblo with its church and local government.\n\nSince its foundation in 1602, the town had been ravaged by calamitous forces such as fires, typhoons, floods and human vandalism during the Philippine Revolution of 1896\u20131899, the war of the Philippine Independence (1899\u20131902), [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Battle of Santa Cruz]], the assault of the Tulisanes (bandits) during the Spanish times. The Filipino troops of the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas also came from the town and was involved in the Second Battle of Santa Cruz on January 26, 1945. \n\nCharacterized by fertile flat lands situated along the coastal plains of Laguna de Bay, the economic base of the town had been traditionally anchored on two primary industries, namely agriculture and fishing which still remain up to the present. In view of the strategic location of Santa Cruz relative to the other coastal settlements about the lake, trading activities have likewise rooted on the town during those early settlement days. The town proper which has always been the focal point of activities used to be accessible to the other lake-shore areas due to the navigable [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] aside from the [[Laguna de Bay]] itself. Since those early days, water is the principal mode of transportation.\n\nToday, Santa Cruz serves as the capital of Laguna and is considered as the business and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pila & Sta Cruz Laguna.JPG|thumb|Aerial view with Santa Cruz in the centre and [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the foreground]]\nSituated at the central portion of Laguna province along the south-eastern coast of Laguna de Bay, Santa Cruz lies {{convert|87|km}} southeast of Metro Manila via Calamba and is geographically located at approximately 14 degrees 17' latitude and 121 degrees 25' longitude.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nSanta Cruz is situated on the banks of the [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] which flows into the eastern part of [[Laguna de Bay]]. The town is bounded by the Bay on the north, by Lumban and Pagsanjan towns in the east, Pagsanjan and Magdalena towns in the south, and Pila in the west. It is {{convert|88|km}} from Manila via Calamba and Los Ba\u00f1os. It is accessible by land from From Metro Manila Passing Through [[Rizal Province]] Via [[Manila East Road]] or Via [[South Luzon Expressway]]\n\nSanta Cruz is considered as the service and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. The town is composed of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. Although relatively far from the immediate urbanizing influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz continues to progress. It is now classified as first class municipality. The present administration is headed by the Mayor Egay San Luis. Santa Cruz is also the seat of the provincial government since 1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. Boosting the economy of the municipality are the incipient and fast-growing agribusiness industries such as livestock raising, horticulture and aquaculture. The town is composed of twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are being classified as urban.\n\nThe development of Santa Cruz as the administrative, commercial, and service center of Laguna makes it accessible for all private/public vehicles going to nearby places particularly [[Pagsanjan, Laguna|Pagsanjan]], [[Lake Caliraya]], [[Liliw, Laguna|Liliw]], [[Paete, Laguna|Paete]] and [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the last decade of the 16th century, Santa Cruz was once a well populated barrio of the present municipality of [[Lumban]], as well as other contemporary towns like [[Pagsanjan]], [[Cavinti]], [[Paete]] and [[Pangil]]. On June 4, 1602, Santa Cruz separated from Lumban and became a pueblo with its church and local government.\n\nSince its foundation in 1602, the town had been ravaged by calamitous forces such as fires, typhoons, floods and human vandalism during the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1899, the war of the Philippine Independence (1899\u20131902), [[Battle of Santa Cruz (1899)|Battle of Santa Cruz]], the assault of the Tulisanes (bandits) during the Spanish times. The Filipino troops of the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas also came from the town and was involved in the Second Battle of Santa Cruz on January 26, 1945. \n\nCharacterized by fertile flat lands situated along the coastal plains of Laguna de Bay, the economic base of the town had been traditionally anchored on two primary industries, namely agriculture and fishing which still remain up to the present. In view of the strategic location of Santa Cruz relative to the other coastal settlements about the lake, trading activities have likewise rooted on the town during those early settlement days. The town proper which has always been the focal point of activities used to be accessible to the other lake-shore areas due to the navigable [[Santa Cruz River (Philippines)|Santa Cruz River]] aside from the [[Laguna de Bay]] itself. Since those early days, water is the principal mode of transportation.\n\nToday, Santa Cruz serves as the capital of Laguna and is considered as the business and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pila & Sta Cruz Laguna.JPG|thumb|Aerial view with Santa Cruz in the centre and [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] in the foreground]]\nSituated at the central portion of Laguna province along the south-eastern coast of Laguna de Bay, Santa Cruz lies {{convert|87|km}} southeast of Metro Manila via Calamba and is geographically located at approximately 14 degrees 17' latitude and 121 degrees 25' longitude. The municipality is bounded on the north and north-west by Laguna de Bay, on the north-east by Lumban, on the east by Pagsanjan, on the southeast by Magdalena, on the south by Liliw, and on the south-west by Pila.

After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men.

The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul.

Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. The weather finally broke in late August, which saw the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded but caused only superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]] were shot down by ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light antiaircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter squadron in Germany.{{sfn|Morgan & Weal|p=60}} Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco;{{sfn|Schuck|p=177}} the aircrews had not been informed that ''Tirpitz'' had been moved off H\u00e5k\u00f8ya two weeks before the attack.{{sfn|Hafsten|p=221}}\n\nThe wreck of ''Tirpitz'' remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations. Work lasted from 1948 until 1957;{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} fragments of the ship were sold by a Norwegian company.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} [[Ludovic Kennedy]] wrote in his history of the vessel that she \"lived an invalid's life and died a cripple's death\".{{sfn|Van der Vat|p=508}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last=Bishop\n  | first=Patrick\n  | title=Target Tirpitz\n  | publisher=HarperPress\n  | year=2012\n  | isbn=978-0-00-731924-4\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Bishop}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Blair\n  | first = Clay\n  | authorlink = Clay Blair\n  | year = 1996\n  | title = Hitler's U-Boat War\n  | volume = 1 The hunters, 1939\u20131942\n  | publisher = Random House\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-304-35260-9\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Blair}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Breyer\n  | first = Siegfried\n  | year = 1989\n  | title = Battleship \"Tirpitz\"\n  | publisher = Schiffer Pub\n  | location = West Chester\n  | isbn = 978-0-88740-184-8\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Breyer}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = David\n  | year = 1977\n  | title = Tirpitz: the floating fortress\n  | publisher = Naval Institute Press\n  | location = Annapolis\n  | isbn = 978-0-85368-341-4\n  | ref ={{sfnRef|Brown, ''Tirpitz''}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = J.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] antiaircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible break-out of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. ''Tirpitz'' then moved to the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]], just north of Trondheim.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The movement was codenamed Operation ''Polarnacht'' (Polar Night); the battleship was escorted by the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z5 Paul Jakobi||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z8 Bruno Heinemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z29||2}} for the voyage.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] transmitted the location to London.{{sfn|Ottosen|pp=39\u201341}} She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest. The ship's crew cut down trees and placed them aboard ''Tirpitz'' to camouflage her.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The crew also frequently hid the entire ship from [[aerial reconnaissance]] and attacks inside a cloud of artificial fog, created using water and [[chlorosulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Hartl et. al.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Nazi legacy found in Norwegian trees|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43727547|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=11 April 2018|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> Additional antiaircraft batteries were installed around the fjord, as were anti-torpedo nets and heavy booms in the entrance to the anchorage.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=19}} Life for the crew of ''Tirpitz'' was very monotonous during the deployment to Norway. Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting. The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning antiaircraft defences. Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=207}}\n\n=== Operations against Allied convoys ===\nSeveral factors hindered ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} up through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was therefore temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''. The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} On 5&nbsp;March, [[Luftwaffe]] reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ&nbsp;12 near [[Jan Mayen Island]]; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}} or the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, both of which were escorting the convoy, along with four destroyers. Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 27\u201328 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] attacked; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=162}}\n\nThe actions of ''Tirpitz'' and her escorting destroyers in March used up {{convert|8230|t|LT|sp=us}} of [[fuel oil]], which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port. Shortly after ''Tirpitz'' left Norway, the Soviet submarine [[Soviet submarine K-21|''K-21'']] fired two or four torpedoes at the ship, all of which missed.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}{{sfn|Polmar & Noot|pp=115\u2013116}} The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship.{{sfn|Blair|p=644}} Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British [[Admiralty]], which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to [[U-boat]]s and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. ''Tirpitz'' returned to [[Altafjord]] via the [[Lofoten Islands]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'', escorted by several destroyers, steaming in the [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] in October 1942]]\nFollowing ''R\u00f6sselsprung'', the Germans moved ''Tirpitz'' to [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] near Narvik. By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4&nbsp;January 1943 in [[Trondheim Fjord]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 21 February, Topp was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]] and was replaced by Captain [[Hans Karl Meyer|Hans Meyer]]; five days later the battleship ''Scharnhorst'' was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]] was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBy the time ''Scharnhorst'' arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased. To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected some {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. William Garzke and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. The weather finally broke in late August, which saw the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded but caused only superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]] were shot down by ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light antiaircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] fighter squadron in Germany.{{sfn|Morgan & Weal|p=60}} Ehrler was exonerated by further investigations which concluded poor communication between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe had caused the fiasco;{{sfn|Schuck|p=177}} the aircrews had not been informed that ''Tirpitz'' had been moved off H\u00e5k\u00f8ya two weeks before the attack.{{sfn|Hafsten|p=221}}\n\nThe wreck of ''Tirpitz'' remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations.

The suggested format was one where after the first round the top six teams would continue while the bottom three teams would have other matches arranged for them.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 86\n| date = 1924-04-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240410.2.136.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-04}}</ref> However all nine teams remained in the grade until the end of the season. The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref>.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. The Secretary of the club, C. J, Williams disputed the way the Auckland Rugby League had handled the matter and several of the facts in a letter to the [[Auckland Star]]. The ARL Chairman, Mr. W. Hammill replied to the letter \"that the matters contained therein were hardly correct\"<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Why Manukau Changed Over/Management Criticised/Unsatisfactory Decisions\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume 55, Issue 164\n| date = 1924-07-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240712.2.20\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.\n\n===Goals From Marks===\nAt the ARL Management Committee meeting on August 13 the Referee's Association reported that goals from marks would no longer be permitted. This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref>.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. The Secretary of the club, C. J, Williams disputed the way the Auckland Rugby League had handled the matter and several of the facts in a letter to the [[Auckland Star]]. The ARL Chairman, Mr. W.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15-7\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]].

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15-7\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.

Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref>.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15-7\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.
