Such assumptions increasingly morph FC into a valid intervention among readers who are unaware of the empirical dismissal of the intervention and who might not be skilled in distinguishing solid from suspect research. In this regard, it is likely that FC will continue to reinforce the assumptions of efficacy among parents and practitioners. These perceptions will continue to be reinforced by professional organizations such as the Facilitated Communication Institute at Syracuse University, a fairly wide acceptance of FC internationally, and the vacuum created by few if any future solid empirical studies that are likely to dissuade the faithful.<ref name=\"Mostert, Mark P.

The study demonstrated that the communication partners were \"systematically and unknowingly\" being influenced by their facilitators. The researchers wrote:<blockquote>In fact, the nature of the findings permits us to assert that their output in facilitated communication was not only influenced, but was controlled and determined by the facilitators.

Hall, research director for the Behavior Analysis Center for Autism, wrote: <blockquote>The fact that facilitators often control and direct the typing has been called \"facilitator influence,\" which seems to be a misnomer. \"Facilitator influence\" suggests that the disabled person is emitting verbal behavior, and the facilitator is exerting partial control (or \"influence\") over that behavior. Although partial control certainly may occur when fading prompts within structured teaching programs, such control has not been demonstrated in most cases of FC. Rather than influencing the typed messages, the facilitator appears to be the sole author of those messages.

In order to avoid making the same mistakes over again, the issues and processes underlying the rise and fall of facilitating techniques--as well as other intervention methods--in various countries should have a natural place in research reviews. When an intervention claimed to have exceptional effects disappears, the likely reason is lack of positive results.<ref name=\"von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)\" /></blockquote>By 2005, more than 50 controlled studies and blind tests had been conducted, in addition to numerous controlled tests conducted in legal cases.

However, this information has not stopped many individuals from using this technique under various circumstances and furthermore, advocating for its effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/syracuse_apple_and_autism_pseudoscience/|title=Syracuse, Apple, and Autism Pseudoscience &#124; Skeptical Inquirer|first=Marc|last=Kreidler|date=April 28, 2016}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of studies conducted on the efficacy of this technique has revealed that any \"positive\" results indicating that facilitated communication has worked can be attributed to the facilitators themselves. Be it the facilitator attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual, or creating a pseudo-personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them, it is clear that the facilitator is really the one doing all the communicating. The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) issued a statement in 1994 that there was \"no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.\"<ref name=\"APA FC statement\">{{cite web|title=Facilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> Finally, even further defining facilitated communication as a pseudoscience, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a statement indicating that facilitated communication studies have repeatedly demonstrated that it is not a scientifically valid technique and that it is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.<ref name=\"APA FC statement\" />\n\n==Previous proponents==\n\nPat Mirenda, professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology and Special Education at the University of British Columbia and co-author David R. Beukelman, Barkley Professor of Communication Disorders at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, had included FC in early versions of their textbook ''Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Supporting Children and Adults with Complex Communication Needs.'' These versions are quoted in pro-FC literature. However, they decided not to include FC in revised versions, and in 2015 Mirenda stated, \"I came to recognize (painfully, to be honest) that my advocacy stance biased me to interpret what I saw on videotapes as independent typing even though other explanations were more plausible (e.g., subtle prompting, resulting in an ideomotor effect), and that, even if independent typing did occur subsequent to FC exposure, only correlational\u2014but definitely not causal\u2014evidence exists with regard to its relationship to FC. In short, I do not endorse FC as a communication or instructional technique, and I do not support its use.\"<ref name=\"Mirenda, Pat (2015)\" />\n\nStephen N.

However, systematic testing by [[Howard Shane]] revealed that the girl could not have been the author of the messages. The case was described in the 1993 PBS [[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]] documentary \u201cPrisoners of Silence\u201d. Unlike many in the FC-proponent community, Boynton accepted the evidence from Shane's testing and other well-controlled scientific studies. She stopped using FC, convinced her school administration to implement a system-wide prohibition on its use, and apologized to the falsely accused parents of the girl she had worked with. In a presentation at the CSICON meetings in 2019, Boynton argued that most FC facilitators are well-meaning but are caught up in a belief system that leads them to discount the overwhelming evidence that FC does not work.<ref name=\"CSICON2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |title=The foibles of FC |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=April 2020 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=12-13}}</ref> She maintains a clearinghouse of professional articles and media coverage about FC, and helped in convincing the University of Northern Iowa to stop sponsoring an annual workshop that included instruction in FC.<ref name=\"Vyse 2\">{{cite web |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Autism Wars: Science Strikes Back |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/autism_wars_science_strikes_back |website=CSI online |publisher=Center for Scientific Inquiry |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref>  As stated by another member of that group (Stuart Vyse), \u201cthis is just the beginning.

In this regard, it is likely that FC will continue to reinforce the assumptions of efficacy among parents and practitioners. These perceptions will continue to be reinforced by professional organizations such as the Facilitated Communication Institute at Syracuse University, a fairly wide acceptance of FC internationally, and the vacuum created by few if any future solid empirical studies that are likely to dissuade the faithful.<ref name=\"Mostert, Mark P.

All twelve participants (people with disabilities) were chosen for the evaluation because their facilitators believed in their ability to communicate through FC. The study demonstrated that the communication partners were \"systematically and unknowingly\" being influenced by their facilitators. The researchers wrote:<blockquote>In fact, the nature of the findings permits us to assert that their output in facilitated communication was not only influenced, but was controlled and determined by the facilitators.

Hall, research director for the Behavior Analysis Center for Autism, wrote: <blockquote>The fact that facilitators often control and direct the typing has been called \"facilitator influence,\" which seems to be a misnomer. \"Facilitator influence\" suggests that the disabled person is emitting verbal behavior, and the facilitator is exerting partial control (or \"influence\") over that behavior. Although partial control certainly may occur when fading prompts within structured teaching programs, such control has not been demonstrated in most cases of FC. Rather than influencing the typed messages, the facilitator appears to be the sole author of those messages. Thus, the focus of analysis is shifted from the disabled person's behavior to the facilitator's behavior.<ref name=\"Hall, Genae (1993)\" /></blockquote> Multiple other double-blind studies were being conducted at the same time,<ref name=\"Green, Gina (1995)\" /> and whenever conditions were adequately controlled to prevent the facilitator from knowing the answers to questions, the results revealed facilitator influence, if not direct authorship.<ref name=\"Green, Gina (1994)\" /><ref name=\"von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)\" /><ref name=\"Heinrich, Paul (February 1992)\">{{cite news|last1=Heinrich|first1=Paul|title=State 'tortured' family - Landmark case finds experts' naivety 'tragic'|work=Sunday Age|issue=Late Edition| date=February 16, 1992|location=Melbourne, Australia|page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Thistledown Regional Centre in Ontario, Canada conducted an internal study of 20 people with autism and stopped using FC when the results showed facilitator influence was \"contaminating the messages being produced.\"<ref name=\"Papp, Leslie (1996)\" /> By 1995, these results had been replicated by researchers worldwide in at least 24 studies in credible, peer-reviewed research journals using multiple different methods that ensure the facilitator doesn't know or can't guess the expected message, or doesn't look at the letters.<ref name=\"Green, Gina (1995)\" />\n\nIn 1997, reflecting on the trajectory FC has taken in several countries, including Denmark, the U.S. and Australia, von Tetzchner wrote:<blockquote>In the struggle to keep up to date with an increasing number of published papers, both researchers and practitioners tend to forget history. In order to avoid making the same mistakes over again, the issues and processes underlying the rise and fall of facilitating techniques--as well as other intervention methods--in various countries should have a natural place in research reviews. When an intervention claimed to have exceptional effects disappears, the likely reason is lack of positive results.<ref name=\"von Tetzchner, Stephen (1997)\" /></blockquote>By 2005, more than 50 controlled studies and blind tests had been conducted, in addition to numerous controlled tests conducted in legal cases. The studies consistently showed \"without a doubt\" that the messages obtained through facilitated communication were controlled by the facilitators and not their communication partners.<ref name=\"Riggott, Julie\" />\n\nThe vast majority of evidence now indicates that facilitated communication is not scientifically valid.

Be it the facilitator attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual, or creating a pseudo-personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them, it is clear that the facilitator is really the one doing all the communicating. The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) issued a statement in 1994 that there was \"no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.\"<ref name=\"APA FC statement\">{{cite web|title=Facilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/facilitated.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> Finally, even further defining facilitated communication as a pseudoscience, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued a statement indicating that facilitated communication studies have repeatedly demonstrated that it is not a scientifically valid technique and that it is a controversial and unproved communicative procedure with no scientifically demonstrated support for its efficacy.<ref name=\"APA FC statement\" />\n\n==Previous proponents==\n\nPat Mirenda, professor in the Department of Educational and Counseling Psychology and Special Education at the University of British Columbia and co-author David R. Beukelman, Barkley Professor of Communication Disorders at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, had included FC in early versions of their textbook ''Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Supporting Children and Adults with Complex Communication Needs.'' These versions are quoted in pro-FC literature. However, they decided not to include FC in revised versions, and in 2015 Mirenda stated, \"I came to recognize (painfully, to be honest) that my advocacy stance biased me to interpret what I saw on videotapes as independent typing even though other explanations were more plausible (e.g., subtle prompting, resulting in an ideomotor effect), and that, even if independent typing did occur subsequent to FC exposure, only correlational\u2014but definitely not causal\u2014evidence exists with regard to its relationship to FC.

However, systematic testing by [[Howard Shane]] revealed that the girl could not have been the author of the messages. The case was described in the 1993 PBS [[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]] documentary \u201cPrisoners of Silence\u201d. Unlike many in the FC-proponent community, Boynton accepted the evidence from Shane's testing and other well-controlled scientific studies. She stopped using FC, convinced her school administration to implement a system-wide prohibition on its use, and apologized to the falsely accused parents of the girl she had worked with.

He added \"the city just moves so slow\" when there was very high demand coming from hospitals and the private sector. According to the contractor, eight out of 10 supply orders could not be filled because DCAS did not pay on time, which a spokeswoman for NYC denied. The office of the comptroller approved 12 contracts with a total value of $150 million before the mayor's office took over the process on March 16. Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] has said that the city may run out of supplies by April if the federal government does not send 3 million N95 masks, 50 million surgical masks, 15,000 ventilators and 45 million surgical gowns, gloves, and face shields.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/city-hall-didnt-order-covid-19-supplies-for-nyc-until-march-6/|title=City Hall didn't secure 1st order of COVID-19 supplies for NYC until March 6|date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321141728/https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/city-hall-didnt-order-covid-19-supplies-for-nyc-until-march-6/|archive-date=March 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne EMS worker expressed frustration at being asked to wear the less effective surgical masks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/21/nyc-first-responders-resent-lack-of-coronavirus-equipment/|title=NYC first responders resent lack of coronavirus equipment|date=March 21, 2020|access-date=March 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322123408/https://nypost.com/2020/03/21/nyc-first-responders-resent-lack-of-coronavirus-equipment/|archive-date=March 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The police union filed a complaint on March 13 due to NYPD officers not being given masks and other protective gear.

Emergency provisions of masks and hand sanitizers did not arrive until early March. According to ''The New York Post'', one medical supply vendor with standing city contracts said that the initial requests for [[protective gear]] from the [[New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services|Department of Citywide Administrative Services]] (DCAS) were bogged down by inefficient bureaucratic delays. One vendor said, \"We'd send them a list of products we can deliver within 24, 48 hours\", but on average it took 72 hours for the agency to place an order. He added \"the city just moves so slow\" when there was very high demand coming from hospitals and the private sector.
