The Spanish soldiers entered combat against the remains of the [[Afrika Korps|Afrika Corps]], made up of German and Italian troops, in December 1942 [[Tunisian Campaign|in Tunisia]].

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]).

After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 [[lava tunnel]]s and extensive lava tree molds. Two large [[landslide]]s are at the head of the Yoshida-Osawa and Osawa-Kuzure valleys.<ref name=Piotr/>\n\n{{As of|2002|12}}, the volcano is classified as active with a low risk of eruption.

In September 2012, mathematical models created by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NRIESDP) suggested that the pressure in Mount Fuji's [[magma chamber]] could be 1.6 [[pascal (unit)|megapascals]] higher than it was before its last eruption in 1707. This was interpreted by some media outlets to mean that an eruption of Mount Fuji could be imminent.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/06/mount-fuji |title=Pressure in Mount Fuji is now higher than last eruption, warn experts | last1=Clark | first1=Liat | magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=September 6, 2012 | access-date=September 6, 2012}}</ref> However, since there is no known method of directly measuring the pressure of a volcano's magma chamber, indirect calculations of the type used by NRIESDP are speculative and unverifiable.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction.

Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.\n\n[[Americanization]] policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society.  After the end of the [[Indian Wars]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies.  It established [[Native American boarding schools]] which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind.\n\nThe [[Dawes Act|Dawes Act of 1887]], which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans.  Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions.  It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of {{convert|93|e6acre|km2}} from Native American control.  Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals.  The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations.  The leading opponent of forced assimilation was [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.\n\n==Europeans and Native Americans in North America, 1601\u20131776==\n\n[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern North America; the 1763 \"Proclamation line\" is the border between the red and the pink areas.]]\n[[Epidemiological]] and [[archeological]] work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 1634\u20131640.  They came from areas where [[smallpox]] was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people.  Tribes such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]/[[Wyandot people|Wendat]] and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.<ref name=\"Warrick\">Gary Warrick, \"European Infectious Disease and Depopulation of the Wendat-Tionontate (Huron-Petun)\", ''World Archaeology'' 35 (October 2003), 258\u2013275.</ref>\n\nDuring this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas.  The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles.  In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries.  To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence.  In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and [[gun]] trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc.  Many Native American tribes took part in [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713) ([[War of the Spanish Succession]]), [[Dummer's War]] (c. 1721\u20131725), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763) ([[Seven Years' War]]).\n\nAs the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community.  In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward.  The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.  Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans. For further information see [[European colonization of the Americas]].\n\nFrom the Native American perspective, European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life, with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to, for instance, by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land.\n\n==The United States and Native Americans, 1776\u20131860==\n[[File:Benjamin Hawkins and the Creek Indians.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]] demonstrating European methods of farming to [[Creek (people)|Creek]] (Muscogee) on his Georgia plantation situated along the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]], 1805]]\n\nThe struggle for empire in [[North America]] caused the [[United States]] in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by [[Great Britain]] in colonial times.<ref name=\"fritz\">Fritz, Henry E. (1963).  ''The Movement for Indian in 1860\u20131890''.  University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons, but as had the British, they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west. The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies, including during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]. As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century, the need for such friendly relations ended. It was no longer necessary to \"woo\" the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States.  Now, instead of a buffer against other \"civilized\" foes, the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States.\n\nGeorge Washington formulated a policy to encourage the \"civilizing\" process.<ref name=\"remini_reform_begins\" /> He had a six-point plan for civilization which included:\n\n# impartial justice toward Native Americans\n# regulated buying of Native American lands\n# promotion of commerce\n# promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society\n# presidential authority to give presents\n# punishing those who violated Native American rights.<ref name=eric_miller>\n{{cite book\n|chapterurl        = http://www.dreric.org/library/northwest.shtml\n|title      = George Washington And Indians\n |accessdate=2008-05-02\n|last       = Miller\n|first      = Eric\n|year       = 1994\n|chapter    = Washington and the Northwest War, Part One\n|publisher  = Eric Miller\n}}\n</ref>\n\nRobert Remini, a historian, wrote that \"once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans\".<ref name=remini_submit_adoption>\n{{cite book\n|last      = Remini\n|first     = Robert\n|title     = Andrew Jackson\n|origyear  = 1977, 1998\n |publisher=History Book Club\n|chapter   = \"Brothers, Listen ...

But it has been conceived to be impracticable to civilize the Indians of North America \u2013 This opinion is probably more convenient than just.|Henry Knox to George Washington, 1790s.<ref name=eric_miller/>}}\n\n===Indian removal===\nThe [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 characterized the US government policy of [[Indian removal]], which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored.\n\nOn September 27, 1830, the [[Choctaws]] signed [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory.\n\nWhile the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials.  The best-known example is the [[Treaty of New Echota]].  It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of [[Cherokee]] tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.<ref>Hoxie, Frederick (1984). ''A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880\u20131920''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.</ref> An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nIn the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans. American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast, just as the Native Americans had before them. No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders, farmers, and soldiers.\n\n===Office of Indian Affairs===\nThe Office of Indian Affairs ([[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as of 1947) was established on March 11, 1824, as an office of the [[United States Department of War]], an indication of the state of relations with the Indians. It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions, at least for Native Americans. In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the [[Department of the Interior]] as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets.\n\nIn 1854 Commissioner [[George W. Manypenny]] called for a new code of regulations. He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers. He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised, as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions.\n\nIn 1858 the succeeding Commissioner, [[Charles Mix]], noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life. In 1862 Secretary of the Interior [[Caleb B. Smith]] questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasi-independent nations.<ref name=\"fritz\" /> Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans, appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead.LGBTQ+\n\n==Americanization and assimilation (1857\u20131920)==\n{{see also|Federal Indian Policy#Allotment and assimilation era (1887\u20131943)}}\n[[File:Portrait of Marsdin, Non-Native Man, and Group of Students SEP 1893.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Portrait of Marsdin, non-native man, and group of students from the Alaska region]]\nThe movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs. They called themselves \"Friends of the Indian\" and lobbied officials on their behalf.  Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers.<ref name=\"fritz\" />  Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians; Catholics were also involved.  The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all non-Christian people.  In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship, English, and agricultural and mechanical arts.<ref>Robert H. Keller, ''American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869-82'' (1983)</ref>\n\n===Grant's \"Peace Policy\"===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\n{{see|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}\n\nIn his State of the Union Address on December 4, 1871, [[Ulysses Grant]] stated that \"the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably ... many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.\"<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/83.html</ref> The emphasis became using civilian workers (not soldiers) to deal with reservation life, especially Protestant and Catholic organizations. The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.<ref>Cary C. Collins, \"A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism and the Grant Peace Policy in Western Washington Territory, 1869\u20131882\", ''Pacific Northwest Forum'' (1995) 8#2 pp 55\u201377</ref>\n\nThe Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869\u20131885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, \"'Some Of Our Best Friends Are Indians...': Quaker Attitudes and Actions Regarding the Western Indians during the Grant Administration\", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1971) 2#3 pp. 283\u2013294 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/967835 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nMany other denominations volunteered to help. In 1871, John H. Stout, sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church, was sent to the [[Gila River Indian Community|Pima reservation]] in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at every turn.<ref>Robert A. Trennert, \"John H. Stout and the Grant Peace Policy among the Pimas\", ''Arizona & the West'' (1986) 28#1 pp. 45\u201368</ref>\n\nIn Arizona and New Mexico, the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers. The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations. They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo.  However, the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching.<ref>Norman Bender, ''New Hope for the Indians: The Grant Peace Policy and the Navajos in the 1870s'' (1989)</ref>\n\nThe peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy. They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma/</ref>\n\nReaction to the massacre of Lt. Col. George Custer's unit at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.<ref>Brian W. Dippie, {{\"'}}What Will Congress Do About It?' The Congressional Reaction to the Little Big Horn Disaster\", ''North Dakota History'' (1970) 37#3 pp. 161\u2013189</ref>\n\n===Code of Indian Offenses===\nIn 1882, Interior Secretary [[Henry M. Teller]] called attention to the \"great hindrance\" of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation.  The resultant \"Code of Indian Offenses\" in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing \"evil practice.\"\n\nA Court of Indian Offenses, consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent, was to be established at each Indian agency.  The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders.  Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts, polygamy, reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices, and intoxication or sale of liquor.  Also prohibited were \"medicine men\" who \"use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs.\"  The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of government-provided rations for up to 30 days.<ref>http://rcliton.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/code-of-indian-offenses.pdf, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Five Civilized Tribes]] were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933.<ref>http://tribal-law.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-of-indian-offenses.html, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nIn implementation on reservations by Indian judges, the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes.  The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or \"heathenish ceremonies.\"<ref>''Report of the Secretary of the Interior'', Volume II. Washington: GPO, 189, pp. lxxxiii-lxxxix.</ref>    Significantly, 1890 was the year of the [[Ghost Dance]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].\n\n=== The role of the Supreme Court in assimilation ===\nIn 1857, Chief Justice [[Roger B.

The progressive era was characterized by a resolve to emphasize the importance of dignity and independence in the modern industrialized world.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\">Tomlins, Christopher L.

The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (191) Print.</ref>  Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts.  The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness.  Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\"/>  These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.\n\nCases such as [[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]], [[Talton v. Mayes]], [[Winters vs. The United States]], [[United States v. Winans]], [[United States v. Nice]], and [[United States v. Sandoval]] provide excellent examples of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as they refer back to the idea of Indians as \"wards of the nation\".<ref>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=187&invol=553</ref> Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions.  Native American nations were labeled \"domestic dependent nations\" by Marshall in [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]], one of the first landmark cases involving Indians.<ref>Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (XXV) Print.</ref> Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.\n\n== Decisions focusing on dependence ==\n\n===''United States vs. Kagama''===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'' (1886) set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power.  To summarize congressional plenary power, the court stated:\n\n{{quote|The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection, as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell. It must exist in that government, because it never has existed anywhere else; because the theater of its exercise is within the geographical limits of the United [118 U.S. 375, 385] States; because it has never been denied; and because it alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=118&invol=375 \"United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886)\"]. Findlaw. Retrieved on 2009-10-19.</ref>}}\n\nThe decision in ''United States v. Kagama'' led to the new idea that \"protection\" of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society.<ref name=\"Mask\"/>\n\n===''United States v. Nice''===\nDuring the years leading up to passage of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]], ''United States v. Nice'' (1916), was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of [[liquor]]. The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before, ''Matter of Heff'', {{ussc|197|48|1905}}, which allowed American Indian U.S. citizens to drink liquor.<ref name=\"UG\"/> The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes.<ref>Canby Jr., William. ''American Indian Law In a Nut Shell,'' 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (1) Print.</ref> The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations, the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent, and needed a guardian for protection.\n\n===''United States v. Sandoval''===\nLike ''United States v. Nice,'' the United States Supreme Court case of ''[[United States v. Sandoval]]'' (1913) rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor.  As American Indians were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens.  The Sandoval Act reversed the ''U.S. v. Joseph'' decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were \"not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution\".<ref>''Red Man's Land White Man's Land'' 2nd edition, Wilcomb B. Washburn, 1995,\np. 141</ref> This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection.\n\n== Decisions focusing on sovereignty ==\nThere were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the [[sovereignty]] of American Indian nations.  These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations.\n\n===''Ex parte Crow Dog'' (1883)===\n''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian.  [[Crow Dog]] argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation.  The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district court's jurisdiction, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2146 precluded the inmate's indictment in the district court. Section 2146 stated that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2145, which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country, did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another, or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe.  The Court issued the writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and ''certiorari'' to the Indian.<ref>''Ex parte Crow Dog'', {{ussc|109|556|1883}}</ref>\n\n===''Talton v. Mayes'' (1896)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Talton v. Mayes]]'' was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments. This case decided that the individual rights protections, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which limit federal, and later, state governments, do not apply to tribal government. It reaffirmed earlier decisions, such as the 1831 ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' case, that gave Indian tribes the status of \"domestic dependent nations\", the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/163/376/case.html \"Full text opinion from Justia.com\"]</ref> ''Talton v. Mayes'' is also a case dealing with Native American dependence, as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority. This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans, the most important of which is the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n===''Good Shot v. United States'' (1900)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a non-Indian. The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue. In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of [[certiorari]]. This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>\"Good Shot v. United States''. LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''Montoya v. United States'' (1901)===\nThis United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E. Montoya & Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by \"Victorio's Band\"  which was a group of these American Indians.  It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another.  One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.<ref>\"Montoya v. United States\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''US v. Winans'' (1905)===\nIn this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe, reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on off-reservation land. Further, the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties. First, treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and \"as justice and reason demand\".<ref>''Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association'', 443 U.S. 658, 668</ref> Second, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather \"a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them\".<ref>Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics'', p. 710. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-57356-149-5}}</ref> These \"reserved\" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights. Political rights reserved to the Indian nations include the power to regulate domestic relations, tax, administer justice, or exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction.<ref>Wilkins, David E. and Lomawaima, K. Tsianina (2002). ''Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law'', p. 125. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3395-9}}</ref>\n\n===''Winters v. United States'' (1908)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[Winters v. United States]]'' was a case primarily dealing with water rights of [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservations]].  This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had \"implied\" rights to put to use.<ref>Duthu, N. (2008). \"American Indians and the Law\", p. 105. Penguin Group Inc., New York. {{ISBN|978-0-670-01857-4}}.</ref>  This case dealt with the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] and their right to utilize the water source of the [[Milk River (Alberta-Montana)|Milk River]] in Montana. The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had.  This became a problem once non-Indian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements.<ref>Shurts, John (2000). \"Indian Reserved Water Rights\", p. 15. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|0806132108}}</ref>  As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana, this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented. After the case was tried, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place. This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era. It was used as a precedent for the cases ''Arizona v. California'', ''[[Tulee v. Washington]]'', ''Washington v. McCoy'', ''Nevada v. United States'', ''Cappaert v. United States'', ''Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States'', ''United States v. New Mexico'', and ''Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona'' which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes.\n\n===''Choate v. Trapp'' (1912)===\nAs more Native Americans received allotments through the [[Dawes Act]], there was a great deal of public and state pressure to tax allottees. However, in the United States Supreme court case ''[[Choate v. Trapp]]'', {{ussc|224|665|1912}}, the court ruled for Indian allottees to be exempt from state taxation.<ref name=\"UG\">Wilkins, David, and K. Tsianina Lomawaima.

United States'' (1912)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case. The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation. This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30, 1897, ch. 109, 29 Stat. 506. The defendant's appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country. The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country. The defendant's argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.<ref>\"Clairmont v. United States\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''United States v. Quiver'' (1916)===\nThis case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota. The case dealt with adultery committed on a [[Sioux]] Indian reservation. The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 397, 24 Stat. 635, now \u00a7 316 of the Penal Code. This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation.<ref>\"United States v. Quiver\".

Andrew White of the [[Society of Jesus]] established a mission in what is now the state of [[Maryland]], and the purpose of the mission, stated through an interpreter to the chief of an Indian tribe there, was \"to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race, and show them the way to heaven\".<ref>Foley, Henry.

From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African-American slaves and free women of color.\n\n[[File:Male Carlisle School Students 1879.jpg|295px|thumb|left|Male Carlisle School students (1879)]]\n\nThe [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] founded by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1879 was the first Indian [[boarding school]] established.  Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida, where they had received basic education.  When released, several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as [[Hampton Institute]]. He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society.\n\nPratt professed \"assimilation through total immersion\". Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated, he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children. Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools: it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. In the summer, students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion. They also provided labor at low cost, at a time when many children earned pay for their families.\n\nCarlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. By 1902 there were twenty-five federally funded non-reservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6,000. Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans, removing students from reservations required parental authorization. Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation.\n\n[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|325px|thumb|right|Pupils at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania (c. 1900)]]\n\nOnce the new students arrived at the boarding schools, their lives altered drastically. They were usually given new haircuts, uniforms of European-American style clothes, and even new English names, sometimes based on their own, other times assigned at random. They could no longer speak their own languages, even with each other. They were expected to attend Christian churches. Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers, and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments.\n\nAdditionally, infectious disease was widespread in society, and often swept through the schools. This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention, inadequate sanitation, insufficient funding for meals, overcrowded conditions, and students whose resistance was low.\n\n[[File:Group of Male and Female Students; Brick Dormitories And Bandstand in Background 1879.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Native American group of Carlisle Indian Industrial School male and female students; brick dormitories and bandstand in background (1879)]]\n\nAn '''Indian boarding school''' was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youths according to American standards. In some areas, these schools were primarily run by missionaries. Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools, they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them. They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages, taught [[Christianity]] instead of their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture. Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented, as in [[North Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nBy 1923 in the Northwest, most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools. States took on increasing responsibility for their education.<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/boarding/marr.htm Carolyn Marr, \"Assimilation through Education: Indian Boarding Schools in the Northwest\"], University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</ref>  Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century, doubling from 1900 to the 1960s.<ref>Colmant, S.A.

Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed, too heavily institutionalized, and run too rigidly. What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted.\n\nIt recommended:\n* abolishing the \"Uniform Course of Study\", which taught only majority American cultural values;\n* having younger children attend community schools near home, though older children should be able to attend non-reservation schools; and\n* ensuring that the Indian Service provided Native Americans with the skills and education to adapt both in their own traditional communities (which tended to be more rural) and the larger American society.\n\n===Indian New Deal===\n[[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1933\u20131945, set the priorities of the [[New Deal]] policies toward Native Americans, with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could. Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians, and in enabling many tribal nations to re-institute self-government and preserve their traditional culture. Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them.\n\nCollier's 1920\u2013 1922 visit to [[Taos Pueblo]] had a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be \"physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless\".<ref>John Collier, \"Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?\" ''The American Magazine of Art.

It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy. Also known as the Wheeler\u2013Howard Act, this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian [[self-determination]] and a return of communal Indian land, which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the [[Indian General Allotment Act of 1887]].\n\nCollier was also responsible for getting the [[Johnson\u2013O'Malley Act]] passed in 1934, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling, medical care, and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations.

However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily \"white\" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn the mid-20th century, as efforts were still under way for assimilation, some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority, rather than citizens of semi-sovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty. The following quote from the May 1957 issue of ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', shows this:\n\n{{quote|The place of Indians in American society may be seen as one aspect of the question of the integration of minority groups into the social system.<ref>Dozier, Edward, et al. \"The Integration of Americans of Indian Descent\", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 311, ''American Indians and American Life'' May 1957, pp. 158\u2013165.</ref>}}\n\nSince the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy.  Similarly the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it.\n\nAs of 2013, \"Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n |title=Native American Center Facts \n |work=The University of Montana \n |accessdate=2013-10-27 \n |url=http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195725/http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |archivedate=2013-10-29 \n}}</ref> The \"Indian Education for All\" curriculum, created by the [[Montana Office of Public Instruction]], is distributed online for primary and secondary schools.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Indian Education for All Lesson Plans\n| accessdate = 2013-10-27\n| url = http://www.opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028155654/http://opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-date = 2013-10-28\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Modern cultural and linguistic preservation==\n{{further|Language shift|Language revitalization}}\nTo evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction.

Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.\n\n[[Americanization]] policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States (American) customs and values, they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society.  After the end of the [[Indian Wars]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies.  It established [[Native American boarding schools]] which children were required to attend. In these schools they were forced to speak English, study standard subjects, attend church, and leave tribal traditions behind.\n\nThe [[Dawes Act|Dawes Act of 1887]], which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals, was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans.  Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions.  It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of {{convert|93|e6acre|km2}} from Native American control.  Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals.  The [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations.  The leading opponent of forced assimilation was [[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.\n\n==Europeans and Native Americans in North America, 1601\u20131776==\n\n[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern North America; the 1763 \"Proclamation line\" is the border between the red and the pink areas.]]\n[[Epidemiological]] and [[archeological]] work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 1634\u20131640.  They came from areas where [[smallpox]] was endemic in the Netherlands, England and France, and passed on the disease to indigenous people.  Tribes such as the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]/[[Wyandot people|Wendat]] and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634.<ref name=\"Warrick\">Gary Warrick, \"European Infectious Disease and Depopulation of the Wendat-Tionontate (Huron-Petun)\", ''World Archaeology'' 35 (October 2003), 258\u2013275.</ref>\n\nDuring this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America, just as they were doing in Europe. At the same time, indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas.  The French, English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies, otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles.  In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces, which deepened some of their rivalries.  To secure the help of the tribes, the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties. The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribe's traditional lands and independence.  In addition, the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons, wanting to keep allies in the fur and [[gun]] trades, positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes, etc.  Many Native American tribes took part in [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713) ([[War of the Spanish Succession]]), [[Dummer's War]] (c. 1721\u20131725), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763) ([[Seven Years' War]]).\n\nAs the dominant power after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain instituted the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], to try to protect indigenous peoples' territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community.  In part, this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side, but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward.  The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists.  Europeans and European governments continued to use military/diplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans. For further information see [[European colonization of the Americas]].\n\nFrom the Native American perspective, European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life, with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to, for instance, by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land.\n\n==The United States and Native Americans, 1776\u20131860==\n[[File:Benjamin Hawkins and the Creek Indians.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]] demonstrating European methods of farming to [[Creek (people)|Creek]] (Muscogee) on his Georgia plantation situated along the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]], 1805]]\n\nThe struggle for empire in [[North America]] caused the [[United States]] in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by [[Great Britain]] in colonial times.<ref name=\"fritz\">Fritz, Henry E. (1963).  ''The Movement for Indian in 1860\u20131890''.  University of Pennsylvania Press.</ref> They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons, but as had the British, they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west. The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies, including during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]]. As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century, the need for such friendly relations ended. It was no longer necessary to \"woo\" the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States.  Now, instead of a buffer against other \"civilized\" foes, the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States.\n\nGeorge Washington formulated a policy to encourage the \"civilizing\" process.<ref name=\"remini_reform_begins\" /> He had a six-point plan for civilization which included:\n\n# impartial justice toward Native Americans\n# regulated buying of Native American lands\n# promotion of commerce\n# promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society\n# presidential authority to give presents\n# punishing those who violated Native American rights.<ref name=eric_miller>\n{{cite book\n|chapterurl        = http://www.dreric.org/library/northwest.shtml\n|title      = George Washington And Indians\n |accessdate=2008-05-02\n|last       = Miller\n|first      = Eric\n|year       = 1994\n|chapter    = Washington and the Northwest War, Part One\n|publisher  = Eric Miller\n}}\n</ref>\n\nRobert Remini, a historian, wrote that \"once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans\".<ref name=remini_submit_adoption>\n{{cite book\n|last      = Remini\n|first     = Robert\n|title     = Andrew Jackson\n|origyear  = 1977, 1998\n |publisher=History Book Club\n|chapter   = \"Brothers, Listen ...

But it has been conceived to be impracticable to civilize the Indians of North America \u2013 This opinion is probably more convenient than just.|Henry Knox to George Washington, 1790s.<ref name=eric_miller/>}}\n\n===Indian removal===\nThe [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 characterized the US government policy of [[Indian removal]], which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes, it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States. The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission, though it was often ignored.\n\nOn September 27, 1830, the [[Choctaws]] signed [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed. The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the U.S. Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare. By the treaty, the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands, opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory.\n\nWhile the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary, it was often abused by government officials.  The best-known example is the [[Treaty of New Echota]].  It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of [[Cherokee]] tribal members, not the tribal leadership, on December 29, 1835. While tribal leaders objected to Washington, DC and the treaty was revised in 1836, the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838.<ref>Hoxie, Frederick (1984). ''A Final Promise: The Campaign to Assimilate the Indians, 1880\u20131920''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.</ref> An estimated 4,000 Cherokees died in the march, now known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nIn the decades that followed, white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans. American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast, just as the Native Americans had before them. No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders, farmers, and soldiers.\n\n===Office of Indian Affairs===\nThe Office of Indian Affairs ([[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as of 1947) was established on March 11, 1824, as an office of the [[United States Department of War]], an indication of the state of relations with the Indians. It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions, at least for Native Americans. In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the [[Department of the Interior]] as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets.\n\nIn 1854 Commissioner [[George W. Manypenny]] called for a new code of regulations. He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers. He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised, as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions.\n\nIn 1858 the succeeding Commissioner, [[Charles Mix]], noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life. In 1862 Secretary of the Interior [[Caleb B. Smith]] questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasi-independent nations.<ref name=\"fritz\" /> Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans, appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead.\n\n==Americanization and assimilation (1857\u20131920)==\n{{see also|Federal Indian Policy#Allotment and assimilation era (1887\u20131943)}}\n[[File:Portrait of Marsdin, Non-Native Man, and Group of Students SEP 1893.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Portrait of Marsdin, non-native man, and group of students from the Alaska region]]\nThe movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs. They called themselves \"Friends of the Indian\" and lobbied officials on their behalf.  Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers.<ref name=\"fritz\" />  Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians; Catholics were also involved.  The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all non-Christian people.  In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship, English, and agricultural and mechanical arts.<ref>Robert H. Keller, ''American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869-82'' (1983)</ref>\n\n===Grant's \"Peace Policy\"===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\n{{see|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}\n\nIn his State of the Union Address on December 4, 1871, [[Ulysses Grant]] stated that \"the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably ... many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination.\"<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/state-of-the-union/83.html</ref> The emphasis became using civilian workers (not soldiers) to deal with reservation life, especially Protestant and Catholic organizations. The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation. Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems, such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted.<ref>Cary C. Collins, \"A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism and the Grant Peace Policy in Western Washington Territory, 1869\u20131882\", ''Pacific Northwest Forum'' (1995) 8#2 pp 55\u201377</ref>\n\nThe Quakers were motivated by high ideals, played down the role of conversion, and worked well with the Indians. They had been highly organized and motivated by the anti-slavery crusade, and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both ex-slaves and the western tribes. They had Grant's ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy. During 1869\u20131885, they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training. Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics.<ref>Joseph E. Illick, \"'Some Of Our Best Friends Are Indians...': Quaker Attitudes and Actions Regarding the Western Indians during the Grant Administration\", ''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1971) 2#3 pp. 283\u2013294 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/967835 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nMany other denominations volunteered to help. In 1871, John H. Stout, sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church, was sent to the [[Gila River Indian Community|Pima reservation]] in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated at every turn.<ref>Robert A. Trennert, \"John H. Stout and the Grant Peace Policy among the Pimas\", ''Arizona & the West'' (1986) 28#1 pp. 45\u201368</ref>\n\nIn Arizona and New Mexico, the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers. The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations. They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo.  However, the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching.<ref>Norman Bender, ''New Hope for the Indians: The Grant Peace Policy and the Navajos in the 1870s'' (1989)</ref>\n\nThe peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy. They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma/</ref>\n\nReaction to the massacre of Lt. Col. George Custer's unit at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.<ref>Brian W. Dippie, {{\"'}}What Will Congress Do About It?'

Teller]] called attention to the \"great hindrance\" of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation.  The resultant \"Code of Indian Offenses\" in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing \"evil practice.\"\n\nA Court of Indian Offenses, consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent, was to be established at each Indian agency.  The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders.  Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts, polygamy, reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices, and intoxication or sale of liquor.  Also prohibited were \"medicine men\" who \"use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs.\"  The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of government-provided rations for up to 30 days.<ref>http://rcliton.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/code-of-indian-offenses.pdf, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Five Civilized Tribes]] were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933.<ref>http://tribal-law.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-of-indian-offenses.html, accessed 27 May 2011</ref>\n\nIn implementation on reservations by Indian judges, the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes.  The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or \"heathenish ceremonies.\"<ref>''Report of the Secretary of the Interior'', Volume II. Washington: GPO, 189, pp. lxxxiii-lxxxix.</ref>    Significantly, 1890 was the year of the [[Ghost Dance]], ending with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]].\n\n=== The role of the Supreme Court in assimilation ===\nIn 1857, Chief Justice [[Roger B.

Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. New York: St. Martin's. 2001. (178) Print.</ref>).

The United States Supreme Court: the pursuit of justice. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co. 2005. (191) Print.</ref>  Indeed, the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts.  The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness.  Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income, decent working conditions, as well as health and leisure for every American.<ref name=\"SCOTUS\"/>  These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era.\n\nCases such as [[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]], [[Talton v. Mayes]], [[Winters vs. The United States]], [[United States v. Winans]], [[United States v. Nice]], and [[United States v. Sandoval]] provide excellent examples of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as they refer back to the idea of Indians as \"wards of the nation\".<ref>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=187&invol=553</ref> Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives, especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices, whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians, and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws. As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans, the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions.  Native American nations were labeled \"domestic dependent nations\" by Marshall in [[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]], one of the first landmark cases involving Indians.<ref>Duthu, Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Books, 2008. (XXV) Print.</ref> Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes, while others preserved tribal sovereignty, while still others sometimes managed to do both.\n\n== Decisions focusing on dependence ==\n\n===''United States vs. Kagama''===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'' (1886) set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power.  To summarize congressional plenary power, the court stated:\n\n{{quote|The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful, now weak and diminished in numbers, is necessary to their protection, as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell. It must exist in that government, because it never has existed anywhere else; because the theater of its exercise is within the geographical limits of the United [118 U.S. 375, 385] States; because it has never been denied; and because it alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=118&invol=375 \"United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886)\"]. Findlaw. Retrieved on 2009-10-19.</ref>}}\n\nThe decision in ''United States v. Kagama'' led to the new idea that \"protection\" of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society.<ref name=\"Mask\"/>\n\n===''United States v. Nice''===\nDuring the years leading up to passage of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]], ''United States v. Nice'' (1916), was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of [[liquor]]. The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before, ''Matter of Heff'', {{ussc|197|48|1905}}, which allowed American Indian U.S. citizens to drink liquor.<ref name=\"UG\"/> The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes.<ref>Canby Jr., William. ''American Indian Law In a Nut Shell,'' 4th edition. West Group, 2004. (1) Print.</ref> The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations, the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent, and needed a guardian for protection.\n\n===''United States v. Sandoval''===\nLike ''United States v. Nice,'' the United States Supreme Court case of ''[[United States v. Sandoval]]'' (1913) rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor.  As American Indians were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens.  The Sandoval Act reversed the ''U.S. v. Joseph'' decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were \"not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution\".<ref>''Red Man's Land White Man's Land'' 2nd edition, Wilcomb B. Washburn, 1995,\np. 141</ref> This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians. The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection.\n\n== Decisions focusing on sovereignty ==\nThere were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the [[sovereignty]] of American Indian nations.  These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations.\n\n===''Ex parte Crow Dog'' (1883)===\n''[[Ex parte Crow Dog]]'' was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.  The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian.  [[Crow Dog]] argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation.  The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district court's jurisdiction, Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2146 precluded the inmate's indictment in the district court. Section 2146 stated that Rev. Stat. \u00a7 2145, which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country, did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another, or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe.  The Court issued the writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and ''certiorari'' to the Indian.<ref>''Ex parte Crow Dog'', {{ussc|109|556|1883}}</ref>\n\n===''Talton v. Mayes'' (1896)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case of ''[[Talton v. Mayes]]'' was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments. This case decided that the individual rights protections, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which limit federal, and later, state governments, do not apply to tribal government. It reaffirmed earlier decisions, such as the 1831 ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' case, that gave Indian tribes the status of \"domestic dependent nations\", the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/163/376/case.html \"Full text opinion from Justia.com\"]</ref> ''Talton v. Mayes'' is also a case dealing with Native American dependence, as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority. This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans, the most important of which is the [[Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]].\n\n===''Good Shot v. United States'' (1900)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a non-Indian. The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue. In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of [[certiorari]]. This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>\"Good Shot v. United States''. LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''Montoya v. United States'' (1901)===\nThis United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E. Montoya & Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880. It was believed that the livestock was taken by \"Victorio's Band\"  which was a group of these American Indians.  It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed. This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorio's Band. This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States, but also their sovereignty from one another.  One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians, even though they are all part of the American Indian nation.<ref>\"Montoya v. United States\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''US v. Winans'' (1905)===\nIn this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe, reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on off-reservation land. Further, the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties. First, treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and \"as justice and reason demand\".<ref>''Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association'', 443 U.S. 658, 668</ref> Second, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather \"a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them\".<ref>Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics'', p. 710. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-57356-149-5}}</ref> These \"reserved\" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights. Political rights reserved to the Indian nations include the power to regulate domestic relations, tax, administer justice, or exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction.<ref>Wilkins, David E. and Lomawaima, K.

United States'' (1908)===\nThe United States Supreme Court case ''[[Winters v. United States]]'' was a case primarily dealing with water rights of [[Indian reservation|American Indian reservations]].  This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had \"implied\" rights to put to use.<ref>Duthu, N. (2008). \"American Indians and the Law\", p. 105. Penguin Group Inc., New York. {{ISBN|978-0-670-01857-4}}.</ref>  This case dealt with the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]] and their right to utilize the water source of the [[Milk River (Alberta-Montana)|Milk River]] in Montana. The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had.  This became a problem once non-Indian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements.<ref>Shurts, John (2000). \"Indian Reserved Water Rights\", p. 15. University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|0806132108}}</ref>  As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana, this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented. After the case was tried, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place. This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era. It was used as a precedent for the cases ''Arizona v. California'', ''[[Tulee v. Washington]]'', ''Washington v. McCoy'', ''Nevada v. United States'', ''Cappaert v. United States'', ''Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States'', ''United States v. New Mexico'', and ''Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona'' which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes.\n\n===''Choate v. Trapp'' (1912)===\nAs more Native Americans received allotments through the [[Dawes Act]], there was a great deal of public and state pressure to tax allottees. However, in the United States Supreme court case ''[[Choate v. Trapp]]'', {{ussc|224|665|1912}}, the court ruled for Indian allottees to be exempt from state taxation.<ref name=\"UG\">Wilkins, David, and K. Tsianina Lomawaima.

United States'' (1912)===\nThis United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case. The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation. This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30, 1897, ch. 109, 29 Stat. 506. The defendant's appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country. The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country. The defendant's argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant.<ref>\"Clairmont v. United States\". LexisNexis. 15 October 2009.</ref>\n\n===''United States v. Quiver'' (1916)===\nThis case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota. The case dealt with adultery committed on a [[Sioux]] Indian reservation. The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3, 1887, c. 397, 24 Stat. 635, now \u00a7 316 of the Penal Code. This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation.<ref>\"United States v.

From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls, and would later offer classes for female African-American slaves and free women of color.\n\n[[File:Male Carlisle School Students 1879.jpg|295px|thumb|left|Male Carlisle School students (1879)]]\n\nThe [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] founded by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1879 was the first Indian [[boarding school]] established.  Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida, where they had received basic education.  When released, several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as [[Hampton Institute]]. He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society.\n\nPratt professed \"assimilation through total immersion\". Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated, he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children. Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt. In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools: it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls, in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations, including chores around the school and producing goods for market. In the summer, students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion. They also provided labor at low cost, at a time when many children earned pay for their families.\n\nCarlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. By 1902 there were twenty-five federally funded non-reservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6,000. Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans, removing students from reservations required parental authorization. Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation.\n\n[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|325px|thumb|right|Pupils at Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Pennsylvania (c. 1900)]]\n\nOnce the new students arrived at the boarding schools, their lives altered drastically. They were usually given new haircuts, uniforms of European-American style clothes, and even new English names, sometimes based on their own, other times assigned at random. They could no longer speak their own languages, even with each other. They were expected to attend Christian churches. Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers, and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments.\n\nAdditionally, infectious disease was widespread in society, and often swept through the schools. This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention, inadequate sanitation, insufficient funding for meals, overcrowded conditions, and students whose resistance was low.\n\n[[File:Group of Male and Female Students; Brick Dormitories And Bandstand in Background 1879.jpg|325px|thumb|left|Native American group of Carlisle Indian Industrial School male and female students; brick dormitories and bandstand in background (1879)]]\n\nAn '''Indian boarding school''' was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youths according to American standards. In some areas, these schools were primarily run by missionaries. Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools, they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them. They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages, taught [[Christianity]] instead of their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture. Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented, as in [[North Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nBy 1923 in the Northwest, most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools. States took on increasing responsibility for their education.<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/boarding/marr.htm Carolyn Marr, \"Assimilation through Education: Indian Boarding Schools in the Northwest\"], University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</ref>  Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century, doubling from 1900 to the 1960s.<ref>Colmant, S.A.

Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed, too heavily institutionalized, and run too rigidly. What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted.\n\nIt recommended:\n* abolishing the \"Uniform Course of Study\", which taught only majority American cultural values;\n* having younger children attend community schools near home, though older children should be able to attend non-reservation schools; and\n* ensuring that the Indian Service provided Native Americans with the skills and education to adapt both in their own traditional communities (which tended to be more rural) and the larger American society.\n\n===Indian New Deal===\n[[John Collier (sociologist)|John Collier]], the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1933\u20131945, set the priorities of the [[New Deal]] policies toward Native Americans, with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could. Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians, and in enabling many tribal nations to re-institute self-government and preserve their traditional culture. Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them.\n\nCollier's 1920\u2013 1922 visit to [[Taos Pueblo]] had a lasting impression on Collier. He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society, which he considered to be \"physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless\".<ref>John Collier, \"Does the Government Welcome the Indian Arts?\" ''The American Magazine of Art.

It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy. Also known as the Wheeler\u2013Howard Act, this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian [[self-determination]] and a return of communal Indian land, which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the [[Indian General Allotment Act of 1887]].\n\nCollier was also responsible for getting the [[Johnson\u2013O'Malley Act]] passed in 1934, which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling, medical care, and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations. The act was effective only in Minnesota.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson|author2=Raymond Wilson|title=Native Americans in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHj1q_kj1pAC&pg=PA113|year=1986|publisher=University of Illinois Press|pages=113\u201315|isbn=9780252012853}}</ref>\n\nCollier's support of the [[Navajo Livestock Reduction]] program resulted in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] opposition to the Indian New Deal.<ref>Peter Iverson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aP4QyAXsnmkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Dine:+A+History+of+the+Navajos%27%27&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=ZYVIVemtMYP6aL-sgOAF&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Dine%3A%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Navajos''&f=false Din\u00e9: A History of the Navajos]'' (2002) p 144</ref><ref>Donald A.

Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 2007, 9,500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} From 1879 when the Carlisle Indian School was founded to the present day, more than 100,000 American Indians are estimated to have attended an Indian boarding school.\n\nA similar system in Canada was known as the [[Canadian residential school system]].<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html Andrea Smith, \"Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208092347/http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html |date=2006-02-08 }}, ''Amnesty Magazine'', Amnesty International website</ref>\n\n==Lasting effects of the Americanization policy==\nWhile the concerted effort to assimilate Native Americans into American culture was abandoned officially, integration of Native American tribes and individuals continues to the present day. Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated. However, some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily \"white\" European majority society, despite efforts to socially integrate them.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn the mid-20th century, as efforts were still under way for assimilation, some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority, rather than citizens of semi-sovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty. The following quote from the May 1957 issue of ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', shows this:\n\n{{quote|The place of Indians in American society may be seen as one aspect of the question of the integration of minority groups into the social system.<ref>Dozier, Edward, et al. \"The Integration of Americans of Indian Descent\", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 311, ''American Indians and American Life'' May 1957, pp. 158\u2013165.</ref>}}\n\nSince the 1960s, however, there have been major changes in society. Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups, as well as for the special status of Native American nations. More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices, for instance, points to major changes in government policy.  Similarly the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it.\n\nAs of 2013, \"Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history, culture, and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n |title=Native American Center Facts \n |work=The University of Montana \n |accessdate=2013-10-27 \n |url=http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195725/http://life.umt.edu/aiss/nativeamericancenter/facts.php \n |archivedate=2013-10-29 \n}}</ref> The \"Indian Education for All\" curriculum, created by the [[Montana Office of Public Instruction]], is distributed online for primary and secondary schools.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Indian Education for All Lesson Plans\n| accessdate = 2013-10-27\n| url = http://www.opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131028155654/http://opi.mt.gov/Programs/IndianEd/curricsearch.html\n| archive-date = 2013-10-28\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Modern cultural and linguistic preservation==\n{{further|Language shift|Language revitalization}}\nTo evade a shift to English, some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction.
