During World War II, the battalion served at Normandy and later inactivated in 1949 at [[Camp Lee]], Virginia.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1953, the battalion was activated for services in Europe during the [[Cold War]]. In 1963, the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] at [[Long Binh Post|Long Binh]] in April 1966 and later inactivated in 1970 with the post-Vietnam War downsizing of the Army. \n\nOn 1 December 1975, the battalion was reactivated as the 64th Support Battalion and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Carson, where it began its long association with the 4th Infantry Division. It deployed as a unit, with 550 personnel to [[Wiesbaden|Wiesbaden,]] [[West Germany]], as part of \"[[4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division (United States)|Brigade 76]]\" in April 1976. This deployment was a task force used as a rapid deployment unit with a mechanized brigade made up of units from Fort Carson all of which were on a rotational assignment basis. When expected cost savings from the use of rotation force failed to materialize, the brigade was permanently reassigned to Europe and served in Germany until its deactivation in 1984. On 15 May 1987, the battalion was reactivated as the 64th Forward Support Battalion at Fort Carson and assigned to 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. In 1995, the battalion moved to [[Fort Hood]], Texas with the entirety of the division and returned \"home\" to Fort Carson in 2009. In 2006, the battalion was redesignated the 64th Brigade Support Battalion in accordance with the [[Reorganization plan of United States Army#Modular combat brigades|transformation of the Army]].\n\nSince the beginning of the [[Global War on Terrorism]], the battalion has deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2004, 2005 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, and 2010 to 2011; Operation Inherent Resolve in 2015; Operation Atlantic Resolve in 2017; and Operation Spartan Shield in 2019.\n\n== Distinctive Unit Insignia ==\nThe distinctive unit insignia worn by the soldiers of this battalion is the primary buff and scarlet, colors symbolic of support units. Black refers to the petroleum capability of the battalion. The fleur-de-lis and the three battlements allude to the three campaigns credited to the battalion in France and Europe in World War II. The original rice motif symbolized service in Vietnam. The turned down inner blades of the wreath, crossing diagonally simulate the Roman numeral X and refer to participation in the ten campaigns in Vietnam. The two red areas allude to the two meritorious unit commendations awarded to the battalion during service in Vietnam.\n\n<br />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|64th Brigade Support Battalion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:064}}\n[[Category:Support battalions of the United States Army|BSB 0064]]\n[[Category:Quartermaster battalions of the United States Army|6 0064]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=August 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name                     = 64th Brigade Support Battalion\n| image                         = 64th_Support_Battalion_Colors.jpg\n| image_size                    = 250\n| caption                       = Battalion Colors\n| dates                         = 1942\n| country                       = United States\n| allegiance                    = \n| branch                        = US Army\n| type                          = Support\n| size                          = Battalion\n| command_structure             = 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]]\n| current_commander             = LTC Curtis D Bowe\n| current_S4                    = \n| garrison                      = [[Fort Carson]], [[Colorado]]\n| ceremonial_chief              = \n| colonel_of_the_regiment       = \n| commander4                    = CSM Jermain Jackson\n| nickname                      = Mountaineers\n| patron                        = \n| motto                         = \"Can't Stop, Won't Stop!\"\n| colors                        = \n| march                         = \n| mascot                        = \n| battles                       = [[World War II]]<br>\n[[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]\n[[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]\n| notable_commanders            = \n| anniversaries                 = \n| decorations                   = [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]]\n| battle_honours                = \n| identification_symbol         = [[File:64_Spt_Bn_DUI.jpg|100px]]\n| identification_symbol_label   = Distinctive unit insignia\n}}\nThe '''64th Brigade Support Battalion''', nicknamed \"Mountaineers,\" is a [[United States Army]] Support Battalion, assigned to the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] in [[Fort Carson]], Colorado.\n\n==History==\nThe 64th Brigade Support Battalion was originally constituted as the 64th Quartermaster Battalion in 1942 at [[Camp Barkeley]], Texas.

It took its name from a French trader who settled on this stream below the fork previous to 1800. Hon. H. W. Blodgett, of Waukegan, informs the writer that J. B. Beaubien had often spoken to him of the old Frenchman, Du Page, whose station was on the bank of the river, down toward its mouth, and stated that the river took its name from him. The county name must have the same origin. Col Gurden S. Hubbard, who came into the country in 1818, informs the writer that the name DuPage, as applied to the river then, was universally known, but the trader for whom it was named lived there before his time. Mr. Beaubien says it is pronounced Du Pazhe (a having the sound of ah, and that the P should be a capital). This was in reply to Mr. Blodgett\u2019s inquiry of him concerning the matter.</blockquote>The first white settler in DuPage County was Bailey Hobson, who, with Lewis Stewart, built a house in 1831 for the Hobson family at a site about 2 miles south of present-day downtown Naperville.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Du Page County, Illinois|last=Blanchard|first=Rufus|publisher=O.L.

It took its name from a French trader who settled on this stream below the fork previous to 1800. Hon. H. W. Blodgett, of Waukegan, informs the writer that J. B. Beaubien had often spoken to him of the old Frenchman, Du Page, whose station was on the bank of the river, down toward its mouth, and stated that the river took its name from him. The county name must have the same origin. Col Gurden S. Hubbard, who came into the country in 1818, informs the writer that the name DuPage, as applied to the river then, was universally known, but the trader for whom it was named lived there before his time. Mr. Beaubien says it is pronounced Du Pazhe (a having the sound of ah, and that the P should be a capital). This was in reply to Mr. Blodgett\u2019s inquiry of him concerning the matter.</blockquote>The first white settler in DuPage County was Bailey Hobson, who, with Lewis Stewart, built a house in 1831 for the Hobson family at a site about 2 miles south of present-day downtown Naperville.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Du Page County, Illinois|last=Blanchard|first=Rufus|publisher=O.L.

The headline of the article was \"F1 Boss has Sick Nazi Orgy with Five Hookers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/f1-boss-admits-passion-for-sadomasochistic-sex-but-denies-sick-nazi-orgy_10068941.html |title=F1 boss admits passion for sadomasochistic sex but denies \"sick Nazi orgy\" |publisher=Thaindian.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> This was accompanied by the sub-heading \"Son of Hitler-loving fascist in sex shame\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Mosley is the son of [[Oswald Mosley]], who was the leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]] during the 1930s. Mosley relied upon an action based upon [[Breach of confidence in English law|breach of confidence]] or the unauthorised disclosure of personal information rather than defamation. Mosley claimed that sexual or sadomasochistic activities were inherently private in nature and that their portrayal was an invasion of privacy by reason of a preexisting relationship of confidentiality between the participants.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Judgment==\nMosley's case relied in part on the ruling in the case ''[[McKennitt v Ash]]'' where there was \"breach of confidence by way of conduct inconsistent with a pre-existing relationship, rather than simply of the purloining of private information\".<ref>''[[McKennitt v Ash]]'' [2008] QB 73 at [8], per Buxton LJ.</ref> However, Justice [[David Eady]] also stated \"The law now affords protection to information in respect of which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in circumstances where there is no preexisting relationship giving rise of itself to an enforceable duty of confidence\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> He stated that the passing of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] required this conclusion and that therefore the relevant values in this case were expressed in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Articles 8]] and [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|10]] of the European Convention on Human Rights, as ''[[Campbell v MGN Ltd]]'' established these values are as much applicable to disputes between two private individuals as where one is a public body. Justice Eady held that the first hurdle was the need to show a reasonable expectation of privacy, and if this could be overcome it was a matter of weighing up the competing Convention rights.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===The Nazi allegation===\n\nThe principal factual dispute between the parties was whether there was any \"Nazi\" or \"death camp\" element to the incident. The claimant denied this as did four of the prostitutes. On the fourth day of the trial it was revealed that [[News Group Newspapers Limited]] would place no further reliance on \"Woman&nbsp;E\", the prostitute who had recorded the incident and eventually received \u00a320,000 (approx. $31,000) for doing so. The lawyers representing Mosley contended that the video represented a \"'standard' S-and-M prison scenario\".\n\nWhen Mosley issued a denial after the first article was published, The ''News of the World'' published a further article the following Sunday including a ten-point rebuttal, insisting that there was a Nazi element to the scenario. The rebuttal argued, among other things, that the scenario included an imitation modern German [[Luftwaffe]] jacket, striped prison uniforms, and medical examinations and that Mosley spoke in [[German language|German]] or with a fake German accent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_07_08mosleyvnewsgroup.pdf | work=BBC News | accessdate=2010-05-12| title=Approved Judgment}}</ref> The ''News of the World'' also took an exclamation by one of the women \"Brunettes rule!\" as a reference to Nazi racial policies.\n\nJustice Eady suggested that equating everything German with Nazism was offensive. He concluded that there was nothing specific to the Nazi period about the medical examination nor the fact that the claimant had his head shaved.

The headline of the article was \"F1 Boss has Sick Nazi Orgy with Five Hookers\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/f1-boss-admits-passion-for-sadomasochistic-sex-but-denies-sick-nazi-orgy_10068941.html |title=F1 boss admits passion for sadomasochistic sex but denies \"sick Nazi orgy\" |publisher=Thaindian.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> This was accompanied by the sub-heading \"Son of Hitler-loving fascist in sex shame\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Mosley is the son of [[Oswald Mosley]], who was the leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]] during the 1930s. Mosley relied upon an action based upon [[Breach of confidence in English law|breach of confidence]] or the unauthorised disclosure of personal information rather than defamation. Mosley claimed that sexual or sadomasochistic activities were inherently private in nature and that their portrayal was an invasion of privacy by reason of a preexisting relationship of confidentiality between the participants.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Judgment==\nMosley's case relied in part on the ruling in the case ''[[McKennitt v Ash]]'' where there was \"breach of confidence by way of conduct inconsistent with a pre-existing relationship, rather than simply of the purloining of private information\".<ref>''[[McKennitt v Ash]]'' [2008] QB 73 at [8], per Buxton LJ.</ref> However, Justice [[David Eady]] also stated \"The law now affords protection to information in respect of which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in circumstances where there is no preexisting relationship giving rise of itself to an enforceable duty of confidence\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> He stated that the passing of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] required this conclusion and that therefore the relevant values in this case were expressed in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Articles 8]] and [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|10]] of the European Convention on Human Rights, as ''[[Campbell v MGN Ltd]]'' established these values are as much applicable to disputes between two private individuals as where one is a public body. Justice Eady held that the first hurdle was the need to show a reasonable expectation of privacy, and if this could be overcome it was a matter of weighing up the competing Convention rights.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===The Nazi allegation===\n\nThe principal factual dispute between the parties was whether there was any \"Nazi\" or \"death camp\" element to the incident. The claimant denied this as did four of the prostitutes. On the fourth day of the trial it was revealed that [[News Group Newspapers Limited]] would place no further reliance on \"Woman&nbsp;E\", the prostitute who had recorded the incident and eventually received \u00a320,000 (approx. $31,000) for doing so. The lawyers representing Mosley contended that the video represented a \"'standard' S-and-M prison scenario\".\n\nWhen Mosley issued a denial after the first article was published, The ''News of the World'' published a further article the following Sunday including a ten-point rebuttal, insisting that there was a Nazi element to the scenario. The rebuttal argued, among other things, that the scenario included an imitation modern German [[Luftwaffe]] jacket, striped prison uniforms, and medical examinations and that Mosley spoke in [[German language|German]] or with a fake German accent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_07_08mosleyvnewsgroup.pdf | work=BBC News | accessdate=2010-05-12| title=Approved Judgment}}</ref> The ''News of the World'' also took an exclamation by one of the women \"Brunettes rule!\" as a reference to Nazi racial policies.\n\nJustice Eady suggested that equating everything German with Nazism was offensive. He concluded that there was nothing specific to the Nazi period about the medical examination nor the fact that the claimant had his head shaved. Eady also concluded that the use of an English ''[[nom de guerre]]'' weakened the suggestion that there was a Nazi element to the incident. Eady suggested that the prison uniforms did nothing to identify the Nazi era.\n\n===Missing e-mails===\nThe ''News of the World'' placed weight on the fact that one of the prostitutes (Woman&nbsp;\"A\") deleted e-mails prior to the trial.\n\n===Allegation of criminality===\n{{See|R v Brown}}\nJustice Eady rejected the argument that Mosley could be said to have committed a crime under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] on himself.\n\n==Case==\nMosley challenged the publication of details of his private life under [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article&nbsp;8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in respect to the headline which read \"F1 boss has sick Nazi orgy with five hookers\".

{"title_page": "St\u00e9phane Trano", "text_new": "[[File:stephane Trano.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Stephan Trano]]\n'''Stephane Trano''' (born February 1, 1969 in France) is a French journalist and author based in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His most recent contribution as a guest columnist began in October 2018 in the French weekly newsmagazine [[Le Point]].\n\n==Biographies==\nTrano has authored three biographical essays:\n\n* In 2000, on [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], ''Mitterrand, Les Amis D\u2019abord'' Trano explored in-depth the former French president\u2019s personal networks. The preface was written by [[Jean Lacouture]], the French biographer of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Lacouture writes: \"''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, whose public life is arranged traditionally around three or four parties, including one he roughly forged, confided in me that \"in politics, everything is a matter of banding together\", which could also have been said, of religion, by a general of the Jesuits in their heyday. And when he defined a friend as he in whom nothing, neither Bousquet, nor failure, nor insult, could alter public or private loyalty, he seemed to speak less as a politician or secular moralist than as an adherent of a religious order.'' ''St\u00e9phane Trano suggests, line by line, that the reason for the State has reasons other than the reason of the heart. And that loyalty, noble virtue that it is, can be, in the public order, incompatible with the general interest.''\" In this first book on Mitterrand, Trano published a conversation with his long-hidden daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (since then known as Mazarine Pingeot-Mitterrand). Pingeot-Mitterrand had never before witnessed publicly about her relationship with her father in a book.\n\nImage:[[File:St\u00e9phane_Trano,_Mitterrand_Une_Affaire_d'Amiti\u00e9.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n* In 2006, with ''Une Affaire d\u2019Amitie'', Trano extended its work to Mitterrand's families. [[Mazarine Pingeot]] wrote the preface, and the former French Minister of Culture from 1981 to 1997 under Mitterrand, Jack Lang, signed the postface.<ref>[http://image1.archambault.ca/1/B/1/B/ACH001776626.1307695072.580x580.jpg Image of cover of Trano's book on Mitterrand]</ref>\n* An essay about John Fitzgerald Kennedy (November 2013, L'Archipel), \"''a character built by his entourage (...) Appointed by his father to fulfill his own presidential destiny (...), the first politician invented by the new dominant post-war mass media and shaped by marketing.''\" According to the author, the legend of Kennedy was \"''carefully maintained by censorship and powerfully organized by his family, and then conveyed by historians. However, his diseases (...), his obsession with women, his dangerous relationships, the wandering of his political thought... (...) represent everything America usually hates : concealment , perjury , betrayal, corruption. Fifty years after his death, the best-hidden mystery of the icon of American lies not in his murder, but in a life totally concealed by myth.''\"  <ref>{{cite book|last=Trano|first=Stephane|title=L'Invention du Mensonge|date=November 2013|publisher=L'Archipel|location=Paris|isbn=978-2809812671}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\nAt the age of 18, Trano's first news articles appeared in the weekly magazine ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' (The New Observer), founded in 1950 by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in conjunction with former members of the [[French Resistance]]. He first began as a celebrity lifestyles reporter but soon became a political journalist.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, Trano served as Chief Political Editor of the weekly [[:fr:Tribune juive (France)|Tribune Juive]] (Jewish Tribune).<ref>Les inrockuptibles: Issues 261-270; Issues 261-270 2000 St\u00e9phane Trano. journaliste, \u00e9crivain.

Not one of these monstrosities, conducted thanks to the permanent state of surrender of international law, it could not be avoided, despite Auschwitz, this paroxysmal event of the purifying madness of men.\n\nIn such a context, and with the certain announcement of new and numerous genocides to come, the injunction of Nie Wieder (\"Never Again\") resonates like a sinister farce. Since, in the first scrap of the war in former Yugoslavia, the case was heard: that which the Europeans - let us leave off speaking of governments, while the anti-war protests brought together only a few hundred citizens! - had sworn to have extracted their from their soul and to no longer be able to tolerate within them, they watch today, fascinated.  A fascination that conquers the world. Sigmund Freud thought that \"that which can not be remembered is repeated in behavior\". It seems that this, which the world fails to recall (since it does not want to, without a doubt), is precisely the link between this self-fascination and the consequences that arise therefrom. The German witnesses to the rise of Nazism in Germany explain that they only realized the progress of events when an event of marked violence (Kristallnacht, for example) shook them from their torpor. Still, disbelief remained. But there the protest stops''.</ref>\n\n: En finir avec la Paix des dupes, (Ending the Peace Dupes), Tribune, October 1, 1997.<ref name=\"Ending with the Peace of Fooled\">, ''Green light given to Israel on Sunday for relaunch ofpeace talks with the Palestinian Authorities must not bring delusion. This apparent relaxation, presented by Washington as a success, seems to allow us to forget Madeleine Albright's useless visit to the bedside of the peace process, which demonstrated the total failure of a devastated system. Certainly, after Netanyahou's electoral victory in May, 1996, the Israeli government was generally denounced for its intransigence and systematic blasting of the climate of confidence that has been built in the previous three years.  It is, from there, easy to see the key to resolving the impasse in the Israeli \"relaxation\". It would be to work faster. Because in the course of her recent visit to the Middle East, Madeleine Albright faced a gallery of lures, like mines ready to explode under the negotiators' feet. To name a few: a weakened Palestinian administration, appalling double standards in regard to the terrorism that threatens the Hebrew State; a Syrian dictator rarely held to account for this annexation of Lebanon, who ensures the American godfather of his good will; a fossilized Egyptian regime in its frozen piece with Israel since 1979, trying to be the champion of the Arab cause; a Saudi kingdom, sanctuary to the refuse of the Jewish State, continually procrastinating since 1993; Jordan holding its breath after its peace efforts; or, again, Lebanon calling for \"comprehensive resolution\" while claiming to be unable to disarm the pro-Iranian Hezbollah. There is, and has been since September 1993, an objective consensus to trash the Oslo Accords: between most Arab countries, coolly stashed in the shade of their despotic regimes, uncooperative, and the terrorist states, sowers of chaos.  This undermining has paid off.

His most recent contribution as a guest columnist began in October 2018 in the French weekly newsmagazine [[Le Point]].\n\n==Biographies==\nTrano has authored three biographical essays:\n\n* In 2000, on [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], ''Mitterrand, Les Amis D\u2019abord'' Trano explored in-depth the former French president\u2019s personal networks. The preface was written by [[Jean Lacouture]], the French biographer of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Lacouture writes: \"''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, whose public life is arranged traditionally around three or four parties, including one he roughly forged, confided in me that \"in politics, everything is a matter of banding together\", which could also have been said, of religion, by a general of the Jesuits in their heyday. And when he defined a friend as he in whom nothing, neither Bousquet, nor failure, nor insult, could alter public or private loyalty, he seemed to speak less as a politician or secular moralist than as an adherent of a religious order.'' ''St\u00e9phane Trano suggests, line by line, that the reason for the State has reasons other than the reason of the heart. And that loyalty, noble virtue that it is, can be, in the public order, incompatible with the general interest.''\" In this first book on Mitterrand, Trano published a conversation with his long-hidden daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (since then known as Mazarine Pingeot-Mitterrand). Pingeot-Mitterrand had never before witnessed publicly about her relationship with her father in a book.\n\nImage:[[File:St\u00e9phane_Trano,_Mitterrand_Une_Affaire_d'Amiti\u00e9.jpg|thumb|right|]]\n\n* In 2006, with ''Une Affaire d\u2019Amitie'', Trano extended its work to Mitterrand's families. [[Mazarine Pingeot]] wrote the preface, and the former French Minister of Culture from 1981 to 1997 under Mitterrand, Jack Lang, signed the postface. <ref>[http://image1.archambault.ca/1/B/1/B/ACH001776626.1307695072.580x580.jpg Image of cover of Trano's book on Mitterrand]</ref>\n\n* An essay about John Fitzgerald Kennedy (November 2013, L'Archipel), \"''a character built by his entourage (...) Appointed by his father to fulfill his own presidential destiny (...), the first politician invented by the new dominant post-war mass media and shaped by marketing.''\" According to the author, the legend of Kennedy was \"''carefully maintained by censorship and powerfully organized by his family, and then conveyed by historians. However, his diseases (...), his obsession with women, his dangerous relationships, the wandering of his political thought... (...) represent everything America usually hates : concealment , perjury , betrayal, corruption. Fifty years after his death, the best-hidden mystery of the icon of American lies not in his murder, but in a life totally concealed by myth.''\"  <ref>{{cite book|last=Trano|first=Stephane|title=L'Invention du Mensonge|date=November 2013|publisher=L'Archipel|location=Paris|isbn=978-2809812671}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\nAt the age of 18, Trano's first news articles appeared in the weekly magazine ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' (The New Observer), founded in 1950 by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in conjunction with former members of the [[French Resistance]]. He first began as a celebrity lifestyles reporter but soon became a political journalist.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, Trano served as Chief Political Editor of the weekly [[:fr:Tribune juive (France)|Tribune Juive]] (Jewish Tribune).<ref>Les inrockuptibles: Issues 261-270; Issues 261-270 2000 St\u00e9phane Trano. journaliste, \u00e9crivain.

Not one of these monstrosities, conducted thanks to the permanent state of surrender of international law, it could not be avoided, despite Auschwitz, this paroxysmal event of the purifying madness of men.\n\nIn such a context, and with the certain announcement of new and numerous genocides to come, the injunction of Nie Wieder (\"Never Again\") resonates like a sinister farce. Since, in the first scrap of the war in former Yugoslavia, the case was heard: that which the Europeans - let us leave off speaking of governments, while the anti-war protests brought together only a few hundred citizens! - had sworn to have extracted their from their soul and to no longer be able to tolerate within them, they watch today, fascinated.  A fascination that conquers the world. Sigmund Freud thought that \"that which can not be remembered is repeated in behavior\". It seems that this, which the world fails to recall (since it does not want to, without a doubt), is precisely the link between this self-fascination and the consequences that arise therefrom. The German witnesses to the rise of Nazism in Germany explain that they only realized the progress of events when an event of marked violence (Kristallnacht, for example) shook them from their torpor. Still, disbelief remained. But there the protest stops''.</ref>\n\n: En finir avec la Paix des dupes, (Ending the Peace Dupes), Tribune, October 1, 1997.<ref name=\"Ending with the Peace of Fooled\">, ''Green light given to Israel on Sunday for relaunch ofpeace talks with the Palestinian Authorities must not bring delusion. This apparent relaxation, presented by Washington as a success, seems to allow us to forget Madeleine Albright's useless visit to the bedside of the peace process, which demonstrated the total failure of a devastated system. Certainly, after Netanyahou's electoral victory in May, 1996, the Israeli government was generally denounced for its intransigence and systematic blasting of the climate of confidence that has been built in the previous three years.  It is, from there, easy to see the key to resolving the impasse in the Israeli \"relaxation\". It would be to work faster. Because in the course of her recent visit to the Middle East, Madeleine Albright faced a gallery of lures, like mines ready to explode under the negotiators' feet. To name a few: a weakened Palestinian administration, appalling double standards in regard to the terrorism that threatens the Hebrew State; a Syrian dictator rarely held to account for this annexation of Lebanon, who ensures the American godfather of his good will; a fossilized Egyptian regime in its frozen piece with Israel since 1979, trying to be the champion of the Arab cause; a Saudi kingdom, sanctuary to the refuse of the Jewish State, continually procrastinating since 1993; Jordan holding its breath after its peace efforts; or, again, Lebanon calling for \"comprehensive resolution\" while claiming to be unable to disarm the pro-Iranian Hezbollah. There is, and has been since September 1993, an objective consensus to trash the Oslo Accords: between most Arab countries, coolly stashed in the shade of their despotic regimes, uncooperative, and the terrorist states, sowers of chaos.  This undermining has paid off.
