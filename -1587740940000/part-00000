Meanwhile, the [[Romania]]n [[contortion|contorting]] quintuplets from the show,  along with their grandmother, try to escape from the Romanian government hoping to bring them back. The five end up at the Marsh house, asking for shelter. Meanwhile, Kenny learns to sing through opera tapes (namely \"[[Con te partir\u00f2]]\") . At the Marsh house, [[Grandpa Marsh]] and the quints' grandmother (using her own contortion skills) have sex.\n\nThe next morning, a shocked Randy finds the grandmother dead (after a night with Grandpa Marsh).

The boys then decide to show the quints how great America is, taking them to, among other things, a sheep-shearing contest and a shopping mall, hoping they'll stay and do their circus. Meanwhile, the Romanian government seek [[Janet Reno]] to help get the quints back. Also, seeking to get to Romania for singing training, Kenny sings the aria \"[[La donna \u00e8 mobile]]\" from [[Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Rigoletto]] for money in order to acquire transport for him and his mother. In Romania, Kenny proves to be a sensational singer, and, after his mother realizes that the small amount of money that she brought from the US provides them with two months of food and housing due to the massive cost of living difference between Romania and the United States, the two decide to stay. Back in the US, the Marsh house is surrounded by protesters, hoping to let the quints stay. Reno dresses as the [[Easter Bunny]] and armed with a gun and an Easter Egg-shaped tear gas canister, captures the quints. Stan, Kyle and Cartman, who don't want to lose their circus, enlist the help of the protesters outside to get the quints back.\n\nA large amount of violence starts between the protesters and government soldiers, which is stopped by the quints after they tell off all the groups on their shortcomings: their father for acting like he missed them when he in fact walked out on them five years ago, the Romanian Leaders for caring nothing about them and only wanted to make America look stupid, the protesters for having nothing better to do, and the boys (whom they consider the worst of all) for their ignorance about Romanian culture, arrogant assumptions about America's superiority, and only wanting to use the girls to perform in their circus.

The 122nd episode of the series overall, it originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 17, 2004.\n\nIn the episode, the boys produce their own morning news show on the school's closed-circuit television station and are immediately caught up in an intense competition for ratings.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Token Black|Token]] are taping \"Super School News\", a [[news broadcasting|newscast]] airing on South Park Elementary's [[closed-circuit television]] system. Cartman and Jimmy play the leading roles as head [[news presenter|anchors]], Butters is the [[entertainment]] and [[celebrity]] [[reporter]], Stan is a field reporter, Token is the [[meteorology|meteorologist]], and Kyle does [[sport]]s. However, after their news program airs, their teacher [[Mr. Meryl]] tells them that they did horribly in the ratings, trailing far behind [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]'s [[home video]] show, \"Animals Close-Up With a [[Wide-angle lens|Wide-Angle Lens]]\", which they consider pointless and banal. (The footage is accompanied by the tune ''[[Yakety Sax]]''.)\n\nThe news team then pledges to make a program that will be a ratings booster and gain the attention of all students. They rename the show \"Sexy Action School News\" and add flashy elements (in a parody of various [[infotainment]] shows), including random \"Panda Madness Minutes\" in which the newscasters spontaneously dance with [[giant panda|pandas]]. However, nothing seems to work; although they beat Craig's original series, they fall far behind his new show, \"Animals Close-Up With a Wide-Angle Lens Wearing Hats\".\n\nTo get ideas, the boys decide to [[Non-medical use of dextromethorphan|get high on cough medicine]]. They begin to experience weird hallucinations and start wandering through South Park behaving strangely. They eventually retire to their ideas room, and watch Craig's show with stoned expressions, and find it awesome.\n\nWhen they come around, their notepads contain nothing useful. Then Stan realizes that the video they were watching all night while under the influence of cough medicine\u2014and concluded was the 'greatest show ever'\u2014was Craig's show. They realize that Craig's show gets such good ratings because most of the school must be high on cough medicine. They then decide to produce a special report that gets cough medicine banned from school.\n\nSoon after, the ratings drop and Craig's show is cancelled, as the children are no longer high and therefore no longer enjoy the show. To emphasize the importance of good ratings, the AV teacher then suspends Craig from school and requests the [[Inguinal orchiectomy|removal of his testicles]]. Satisfied with their results, the \"Sexy Action School News\" team discovers the curse of a successful show: each subsequent episode has to be just as good. Back in the writer's room, they come up with nothing and eventually decide to just \"bail\".\n\n==Production==\nWith the 2008 DVD release of the eighth season, many of the audio commentaries revealed that much of the lack of ideas was because ''[[Team America: World Police]]'', [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]'s concurrent film, had just been through a long, grueling post-production which left the staff low on energy:<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2006 |title=South Park: The Complete Eighth Season: \"Quest for Ratings\" |medium=Audio commentary|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|So, this episode marks a very special time in ''South Park'' history, because, this was the first time that we were officially... out of ideas.|[[Trey Parker]] on the DVD commentary for this episode}}\n\n==Home release==\n\"Quest for Ratings\", along with the thirteen other episodes from ''South Park''{{'}}s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006.

Satisfied with their results, the \"Sexy Action School News\" team discovers the curse of a successful show: each subsequent episode has to be just as good. Back in the writer's room, they come up with nothing and eventually decide to just \"bail\".\n\n==Production==\nWith the 2008 DVD release of the eighth season, many of the audio commentaries revealed that much of the lack of ideas was because ''[[Team America: World Police]]'', [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]'s concurrent film, had just been through a long, grueling post-production which left the staff low on energy:<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2006 |title=South Park: The Complete Eighth Season: \"Quest for Ratings\" |medium=Audio commentary|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|So, this episode marks a very special time in ''South Park'' history, because, this was the first time that we were officially... out of ideas.|[[Trey Parker]] on the DVD commentary for this episode}}\n\n==Home release==\n\"Quest for Ratings\", along with the thirteen other episodes from ''South Park''{{'}}s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006.

It began airing on December 5, 2005, hosted by stand-up comedian [[Ben Bailey]], and aired its last episode on September 28, 2012. The show was revived on December 4, 2017. It is part of the global ''[[Cash Cab (British game show)|Cash Cab]]'' franchise that originated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile Bailey's show took place in New York City, some episodes of season six took place in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].  Contestants who ultimately hailed the Cash Cab were not made aware that they were part of the game until they hired the cab and Bailey informed them of the show and its rules.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Discovery Channel began airing a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] edition of the program, ''Cash Cab: After Dark'', in which contestants were picked up near or after sunset as well as overnight and the cash value of the questions was double that of the regular version of the show. The questions were usually more difficult than the daytime version.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, it was announced that the series would be revived.

Another 40 episodes were taped for airing in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe sixth season premiered on February 14, 2011, at 6:00 p.m. E/P. During a hiatus, Ben Bailey did a standup special recounting his time as host of the show. He correctly stated in the special that the show has been cancelled for the last two years (taping for the then-current series wrapped in 2008), however, a renewal offer was made after the standup concert was taped during 2011 returning the show to the schedule.

While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \"Do you want to play?\" pertain to his or her driving and the \"three strikes and you're out\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\n\nFor the first season, the first five questions were worth $25 each, the next five questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. For the second season, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four were worth $50 each, and the ninth and succeeding questions were worth $100. In ''Cash Cab: After Dark'' - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100, and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200, and $400.\n\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\n\n===Red Light Challenge===\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $400 or $600 on a Double Ride, and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers usually four to seven and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 or $500 during Double Ride games regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games at least two per game with the second for accumulating at least $1,000 in revival season it was sponsored by Cash app\n\n===Shout-Outs===\nContestants have two forms of help known as \"Shout-Outs\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone either provided by Bailey or Melewski or one belonging to a contestant if they have one. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride meaning they can ask another person but no second Mobile Shout-out meaning they can't call another person. In the revived Cash Cab, the Mobile Shout-Out was replaced by the Social Media Shout-Out, in which Ben activates Facebook Live so that those on the site may help the contestant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/tv/cash-cab-back-discovery-channel/|title=Cash Cab Is Coming Back to TV (with Celebrity Guests!)

Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money \"at the very last moment\", as Bailey says, and \"leave with nothing but a cab ride\".\n\nUnlike some other versions of the game, U.S. contestants who decline to attempt the Video Bonus are not shown the question they would have been asked.\n\n===Double Ride===\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \"Red Light Challenge\" is worth $500.\n\n==Record payouts==\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121443709962505255?mod=opinion_journal_leisure_art|title= He Drives This Game-Show Vehicle|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | first=Joanne | last=Kaufman | date=June 26, 2008}}</ref> This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \"Video Bonus\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\n\n==Special editions==\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor [[Thomas Haden Church]] of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Jed Ortmeyer]] and [[Ryan Hollweg]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and journalist [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], formerly of [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]''. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. In this episode, the host of ''[[Cash Cab (Canadian game show)|Cash Cab: Canada]]'', [[Adam Growe]], was driving the cab instead of [[Ben Bailey]].\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of ''Cash Cab'' for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. ''[[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]]'' co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of ''[[FV Cornelia Marie|Cornelia Marie]]'' captain [[Phil Harris (fisherman)|Phil Harris]], went against [[Sig Hansen]] (captain of the [[FV Northwestern|''Northwestern'']]) and his two brothers. All cash values were doubled from the Season 3 payouts, the passengers received a second Street Shout-Out, and all money earned was donated by the passengers to the charities of their choice.\n\nIn the ''Cash Cab: Las Vegas'' episodes, filmed in May 2010 and broadcast beginning in August of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/8/9/114010/3894/vegas-travel/Cash+Cab+Shouts+Out+To+Vegas+Tonightl?mod=art|title= Cash Cab Shouts Out To Vegas Tonight|publisher = Vegas Chatter | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> celebrities play for charity and civilians play for themselves.

The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\n\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an [[iPod]] and the car stereo.

It began airing on December 5, 2005, hosted by stand-up comedian [[Ben Bailey]], and aired its last episode on September 28, 2012. The show was revived on December 4, 2017.

The questions were usually more difficult than the daytime version.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, it was announced that the series would be revived.

While the only rules given on-camera after the introduction and before asking \"Do you want to play?\" pertain to his or her driving and the \"three strikes and you're out\" rule, the contestants are also informed that once their traveling begins, the cab will not take detours of any kind unless directed by a police officer, stop sign, traffic light or other legal means of diverting traffic. Bailey or Melewski offers them the chance to get out of the cab if they do not wish to play, and contestants who choose to play the game must stay in the cab until they reach their destination or get three strikes.\n\nFor the first season, the first five questions were worth $25 each, the next five questions were worth $50 each, and any question thereafter was worth $100. For the second season, the first four questions were worth $25 each, the next four were worth $50 each, and the ninth and succeeding questions were worth $100. In ''Cash Cab: After Dark'' - and beginning with the regular episodes of Season 3 - all of the money values were doubled to $50, $100, and $200. Beginning in the fourth season, some games were designated as Double Ride games, making the question values $100, $200, and $400.\n\nEach wrong answer earns the contestant(s) a strike. On the third strike, they forfeit all their winnings and Bailey or Melewski will immediately pull over and kick them out of the cab. Once players have exited the Cash Cab, a camera crew from the trailing production van is already on the street waiting to tape their departure.\n\n===Red Light Challenge===\nWhen a contestant has won at least $200 or $300 in a normal game or an After Dark game - or at least $400 or $600 on a Double Ride, and the cab is forced to stop at a traffic light, Bailey or Melewski will announce a Red Light Challenge. He or she reads a question that has multiple correct answers usually four to seven and the passenger(s) have 30 seconds to give those answers; they do not always have to give all of the answers. Since there is no penalty for an incorrect answer, giving all the correct answers in the allotted time is worth $250 or $500 during Double Ride games regardless of how many incorrect answers a contestant might also blurt out along the way. The contestant does not receive the extra $250 (or $500) if the 30-second time limit runs out; it is also not counted as a strike, and the contestant doesn't lose any accumulated money. While only one Red Light Challenge is usually played per game, beginning in Season 4 there are multiple Red Light Challenges during certain games at least two per game with the second for accumulating at least $1,000 in revival season it was sponsored by Cash app\n\n===Shout-Outs===\nContestants have two forms of help known as \"Shout-Outs\" at their disposal during the game; each can be used only once, and neither may be used on a Red Light Challenge or a Video Bonus. In the Mobile Shout-Out, the contestant makes a phone call to someone they choose by means of a cell phone either provided by Bailey or Melewski or one belonging to a contestant if they have one. The call can take up to a maximum of 15 seconds before the contestant has to give an answer, with the result being either additional money or a strike. The contestant may also elect to use a Street Shout-Out, in which Bailey or Melewski immediately pulls the cab to a curb so that anyone on the sidewalk can be asked for help, without any official time limit. A second Street Shout-Out is included on a Double Ride meaning they can ask another person but no second Mobile Shout-out meaning they can't call another person. In the revived Cash Cab, the Mobile Shout-Out was replaced by the Social Media Shout-Out, in which Ben activates Facebook Live so that those on the site may help the contestant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/tv/cash-cab-back-discovery-channel/|title=Cash Cab Is Coming Back to TV (with Celebrity Guests!)

Bailey/Melewski plays a video clip and asks the contestant(s) a single question based on its content. If the question is answered correctly, the contestant(s) win double what they have earned so far, but if they are wrong, they lose all of their money \"at the very last moment\", as Bailey says, and \"leave with nothing but a cab ride\".\n\nUnlike some other versions of the game, U.S. contestants who decline to attempt the Video Bonus are not shown the question they would have been asked.\n\n===Double Ride===\nBeginning in Season 4, this rarely occurring part of the show happens when randomly selected passengers are able to win double the amount of money of a normal game. The first four questions are worth $100, the second four are worth $200 and the rest until the end of the game are worth $400. The \"Red Light Challenge\" is worth $500.\n\n==Record payouts==\nThe current record of $6,200 won on one ride is held by Sam Meyer (riding solo, on a Double Ride, taking and winning the Double-or-Nothing Video Bonus question) on the episode that aired May 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121443709962505255?mod=opinion_journal_leisure_art|title= He Drives This Game-Show Vehicle|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | first=Joanne | last=Kaufman | date=June 26, 2008}}</ref> This topped the old record held by contestants Sean Devney and Steve Irolla, two New York City tour guides who won $4,100 after answering the \"Video Bonus\" question correctly. They reached their final destination with two strikes (both on $200 questions).\n\n==Special editions==\nOne episode of the program was a special celebrity edition, featuring actor [[Thomas Haden Church]] of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players [[Jed Ortmeyer]] and [[Ryan Hollweg]] of the [[New York Rangers]] and journalist [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], formerly of [[CBS]]' ''[[The Early Show]]''. All played for a charity of their choice, and Discovery Channel matched the contestants' winnings. Another episode was a special in which the passengers were asked questions relating to the 2008 film ''[[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]]''. In this episode, the host of ''[[Cash Cab (Canadian game show)|Cash Cab: Canada]]'', [[Adam Growe]], was driving the cab instead of [[Ben Bailey]].\n\nOn April 21, 2009, Discovery aired a charity episode of ''Cash Cab'' for its 250th episode featuring two rides by boat crew members from ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''. ''[[FV Time Bandit|Time Bandit]]'' co-captain Andy Hillstrand and Josh Harris, son of ''[[FV Cornelia Marie|Cornelia Marie]]'' captain [[Phil Harris (fisherman)|Phil Harris]], went against [[Sig Hansen]] (captain of the [[FV Northwestern|''Northwestern'']]) and his two brothers. All cash values were doubled from the Season 3 payouts, the passengers received a second Street Shout-Out, and all money earned was donated by the passengers to the charities of their choice.\n\nIn the ''Cash Cab: Las Vegas'' episodes, filmed in May 2010 and broadcast beginning in August of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/8/9/114010/3894/vegas-travel/Cash+Cab+Shouts+Out+To+Vegas+Tonightl?mod=art|title= Cash Cab Shouts Out To Vegas Tonight|publisher = Vegas Chatter | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> celebrities play for charity and civilians play for themselves.

The rear of the cab behind the seats contains ten recording decks and other production equipment.\n\nThe lighting and the music that go off when contestants enter the cab consist of a switchboard that is connected to an [[iPod]] and the car stereo. The Video Bonus monitor is a DVD player that is embedded to the back of the front passenger seat.\n\nSome contestants are randomly picked as they walk along the sidewalk, while others are selected in advance.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 29, 1997. In \"Pinkeye\", [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is killed and, through a freak accident, he is brought back to life as a [[zombie]] and starts terrorizing South Park residents, who believe the rise of the living dead is an epidemic of \"[[Conjunctivitis|pinkeye]]\".\n\nThe episode was written by series co-founders [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], along with writer [[Philip Stark]]. The episode was the first of a new slate of ''South Park'' episodes Parker and Stone made after Comedy Central agreed to permanently pick up the show. The duo were not happy with the episode, particularly the ending, and were surprised by the positive response it received from fans. Parker said he also wanted the episode to convey, in part, that [[Halloween]] is a positive holiday for children.\n\n\"Pinkeye\" received generally positive reviews and has been described as one of the classic episodes of ''South Park''. It was viewed by 1.75 million households the week it aired, an unusually high amount for Comedy Central at the time. The episode introduced the recurring character [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Principal Victoria|Principal Victoria]]. When [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] dresses as [[Adolf Hitler]], Victoria removes Cartman's costume and attempts to dress him as a ghost, but inadvertently makes Cartman resemble a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The costumes initially worried Comedy Central executives, but the negative feedback received was minimal.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] are waiting for the school bus as usual when the [[Mir Space Station]] lands and kills Kenny.  Kenny's body is taken to the local morgue. One of the men at the [[morgue]] accidentally leaves a bottle of [[Worcestershire sauce]] open and its contents mix with the embalming fluid, turning Kenny into a [[zombie]]. Kenny bites the two men and leaves in the middle of the night.\n\nThe next day Kenny rejoins his friends, who are dressed up for a Halloween costume contest. Stan is dressed as [[Raggedy Andy]] (since [[Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] would be going as [[Raggedy Ann]], thus making a pair), Kyle wears a [[Chewbacca]] mask, and Cartman is dressed as [[Adolf Hitler]], much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice that he actually is a zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after discovering that the other students (as well as [[Mr. Hat]]) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while [[Mr. Garrison]] is dressed as [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked stupid as the Raggedy couple and she figured Stan would realize it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so he can win the prize, two tons of [[candy]]. Both [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] (dressed as [[Evel Knievel]]) and [[Principal Victoria]] are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a \"ghost\" costume but he ends up looking more like a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by [[Tina Yothers]], Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the [[Solar System]]. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.\n\nMeanwhile, thanks to Kenny, the two men are mistakenly diagnosed to have \"pinkeye\", but they turn into zombies and go around biting other people, turning them into zombies. Back home, Chef, who sees the outbreak on TV, tries to warn both the doctor and [[Mayor McDaniels]] (who is having sex with [[Officer Barbrady]]), but his pleas are ignored. The boys go trick-or-treating (Kyle now dressed as a [[vampire]]), not noticing the outbreak, and abandon Kenny, who continues to eat people. They arrive at Chef's home, and Chef tells them what is really going on before taking them to the morgue to stop the outbreak. After discovering the hotline number on the Worcestershire sauce bottle, the boys and Chef are attacked by the zombies with Chef becoming the next victim and dancing with other zombies. Stan and Cartman kill the other zombies with chainsaws and Stan hesitates to kill a zombified Wendy. After Kyle discovers he has to kill the original zombie (after being told complicatedly by the hotline lady), he slices Kenny in half, killing him. The spell is broken and all the zombies turn back to normal. Stan makes up with Wendy and they are about to kiss but he ends up puking on her, leaving her disgusted.\n\nThe episode ends with the boys mourning at Kenny's grave and deciding to go home to eat candy as well as look at photos of [[Liane Cartman]], who is on the cover of a porn magazine, much to the fury of Cartman claiming she was young and needed the money; Stan says the photos were taken a month ago, infuriating Cartman even more.

Her appearance is based on Comedy Central executive [[Debbie Liebling]], who served as a ''South Park'' producer at the time of the episode's broadcast. Unlike Liebling, however, Principal Victoria spoke with a thick [[Minnesota]]n accent; the voice was chosen simply because it was an accent voice actress [[Mary Kay Bergman]] could do particularly well.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nCartman dresses like [[Nazi Party]] leader Adolf Hitler, and occasionally says \"[[Sieg Heil]]\", a common phrase previously used in [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=\"NYDN1029\" /> Comedy Central had reservations about the idea and sought ideas for other possible costumes, but Parker and Stone insisted it had to be the Hitler costume. Once the episode aired, however, the two received very few letters from upset viewers over the costume; Parker attributed this to the fact that people were becoming more familiar with the Cartman character, and thus recognized that most of what he said and did was usually wrong. More than Hitler, however, Comedy Central executives were worried about the use of Chewbacca costumes throughout the episode because of [[George Lucas]]' well-known tendency to file lawsuits against unauthorized ''[[Star Wars]]'' references or parodies. The channel contacted his production company, [[Lucasfilm]], about the episode and was asked to send a copy of the episode to them for review. The voice used by the supposedly actual Adolf Hitler in the educational video shown to Cartman is based on [[Monty Python]] alum [[John Cleese]]'s Hitler impression, which both Parker and Stone particularly praised.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nActress and singer [[Tina Yothers]], best known for her role in the television series ''[[Family Ties]]'', is featured in the episode as a celebrity judge in the school's costume judging contest. About one year after the episode aired, Stone met Yothers at a venue where she was performing with her band. Stone was uncomfortable because it was the first time he had met a celebrity the show previously mocked, but Yothers said she was a big fan of the show and enjoyed her parody appearance. She used a clip of Kyle saying \"Up yours, Tina Yothers\" from the episode as an introductory sound clip to introduce her band's shows.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nKenny is turned into a zombie after a mortician accidentally knocks [[Worcestershire sauce]], a fermented liquid condiment, into his embalming fluid.<ref name=\"Thriller\">{{Cite news |last=Jones |first=Steve |title=\"Thriller\" video is far from dead |date=2008-02-12 |work=[[USA Today]] |page=4D}}</ref> Parker and Stone originally planned to have a [[Dr Pepper]] fall into the embalming fluid (in a belated response to that product's slogan \"Dr Pepper, What's the Worst That Could Happen?\"), but it was changed after [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group|the soft drink company]] objected to that use of their product.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nThe episode features a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\", as well as the music video. When Chef becomes a zombie, he is dressed like Jackson from the \"Thriller\" video, and he and the other zombies dance in a similar way. Chef also shouts \"Oh\" the same way Jackson often did during music performances. The song Chef sings is also similar to the actual \"Thriller\" song, but Parker said they deliberately made it \"(just) different enough that we can't get sued\".<ref name=\"Commentary\" /> Stan is ridiculed for his likeness to Raggedy Andy, based on the [[rag doll]] character by children's writer [[Johnny Gruelle]]; Stan's girlfriend Wendy was originally supposed to dress as Raggedy Ann with Stan, but she instead chose to dress as Chewbacca.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gire |first=Dann |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |title=End of an epic Our tribute to \"Star Wars,\" a series that spanned generations Readers weigh in on \"Star Wars\" favorites |date=2005-05-13 |location=[[Chicago]] |page=33}}</ref> When Cartman later dons a \"ghost\" costume, it resembles a costume from the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the militant [[white supremacy]] organization.<ref name=\"PD1112\">{{Cite news |last=Ramanavarapu |first=Vijay |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] |title=Laughs on the loose side; Comedy Central show is funny but not for kids |page=1E}}</ref> Parker and Stone said they feel Klan jokes are particularly funny because the concept of KKK is so stupid.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 29, 1997. In \"Pinkeye\", [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is killed and, through a freak accident, he is brought back to life as a [[zombie]] and starts terrorizing South Park residents, who believe the rise of the living dead is an epidemic of \"[[Conjunctivitis|pinkeye]]\".\n\nThe episode was written by series co-founders [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], along with writer [[Philip Stark]]. The episode was the first of a new slate of ''South Park'' episodes Parker and Stone made after Comedy Central agreed to permanently pick up the show. The duo were not happy with the episode, particularly the ending, and were surprised by the positive response it received from fans. Parker said he also wanted the episode to convey, in part, that [[Halloween]] is a positive holiday for children.\n\n\"Pinkeye\" received generally positive reviews and has been described as one of the classic episodes of ''South Park''. It was viewed by 1.75 million households the week it aired, an unusually high amount for Comedy Central at the time.

The boys are kind of the most sane and Chef is really the only one in town who believes the kids when they say (something) is happening, when the kids are actually right and it's the town that's crazy.\"<ref name=\"Commentary\" /> \"Pinkeye\" was also the first episode in which Eric Cartman's mother [[Liane Cartman|Liane]] was portrayed as a promiscuous woman who previously engaged in drugs and prostitution, and is willing to engage in pornographic sex for money; during the episode, she is mentioned and featured on the cover of the fictional men's magazine ''Crack Whore'', much to her son's disappointment.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\n==Release==\nBefore its release on Comedy Central, \"Pinkeye\" was shown at the first annual New York Comedy Film Festival at [[New York Film Academy]] on October 26, 1997.

Her appearance is based on Comedy Central executive [[Debbie Liebling]], who served as a ''South Park'' producer at the time of the episode's broadcast. Unlike Liebling, however, Principal Victoria spoke with a thick [[Minnesota]]n accent; the voice was chosen simply because it was an accent voice actress [[Mary Kay Bergman]] could do particularly well.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nCartman dresses like [[Nazi Party]] leader Adolf Hitler, and occasionally says \"[[Sieg Heil]]\", a common phrase previously used in [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=\"NYDN1029\" /> Comedy Central had reservations about the idea and sought ideas for other possible costumes, but Parker and Stone insisted it had to be the Hitler costume. Once the episode aired, however, the two received very few letters from upset viewers over the costume; Parker attributed this to the fact that people were becoming more familiar with the Cartman character, and thus recognized that most of what he said and did was usually wrong. More than Hitler, however, Comedy Central executives were worried about the use of Chewbacca costumes throughout the episode because of [[George Lucas]]' well-known tendency to file lawsuits against unauthorized ''[[Star Wars]]'' references or parodies. The channel contacted his production company, [[Lucasfilm]], about the episode and was asked to send a copy of the episode to them for review. The voice used by the supposedly actual Adolf Hitler in the educational video shown to Cartman is based on [[Monty Python]] alum [[John Cleese]]'s Hitler impression, which both Parker and Stone particularly praised.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nActress and singer [[Tina Yothers]], best known for her role in the television series ''[[Family Ties]]'', is featured in the episode as a celebrity judge in the school's costume judging contest. About one year after the episode aired, Stone met Yothers at a venue where she was performing with her band. Stone was uncomfortable because it was the first time he had met a celebrity the show previously mocked, but Yothers said she was a big fan of the show and enjoyed her parody appearance. She used a clip of Kyle saying \"Up yours, Tina Yothers\" from the episode as an introductory sound clip to introduce her band's shows.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nKenny is turned into a zombie after a mortician accidentally knocks [[Worcestershire sauce]], a fermented liquid condiment, into his embalming fluid.<ref name=\"Thriller\">{{Cite news |last=Jones |first=Steve |title=\"Thriller\" video is far from dead |date=2008-02-12 |work=[[USA Today]] |page=4D}}</ref> Parker and Stone originally planned to have a [[Dr Pepper]] fall into the embalming fluid (in a belated response to that product's slogan \"Dr Pepper, What's the Worst That Could Happen?\"), but it was changed after [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group|the soft drink company]] objected to that use of their product.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nThe episode features a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\", as well as the music video. When Chef becomes a zombie, he is dressed like Jackson from the \"Thriller\" video, and he and the other zombies dance in a similar way. Chef also shouts \"Oh\" the same way Jackson often did during music performances. The song Chef sings is also similar to the actual \"Thriller\" song, but Parker said they deliberately made it \"(just) different enough that we can't get sued\".<ref name=\"Commentary\" /> Stan is ridiculed for his likeness to Raggedy Andy, based on the [[rag doll]] character by children's writer [[Johnny Gruelle]]; Stan's girlfriend Wendy was originally supposed to dress as Raggedy Ann with Stan, but she instead chose to dress as Chewbacca.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gire |first=Dann |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |title=End of an epic Our tribute to \"Star Wars,\" a series that spanned generations Readers weigh in on \"Star Wars\" favorites |date=2005-05-13 |location=[[Chicago]] |page=33}}</ref> When Cartman later dons a \"ghost\" costume, it resembles a costume from the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the militant [[white supremacy]] organization.<ref name=\"PD1112\">{{Cite news |last=Ramanavarapu |first=Vijay |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] |title=Laughs on the loose side; Comedy Central show is funny but not for kids |page=1E}}</ref> Parker and Stone said they feel Klan jokes are particularly funny because the concept of KKK is so stupid.

He said the episode was particularly notable for its graphic violence: \"Most sitcoms would have a problem doing an episode in which one regular character slices another regular character in half with a chainsaw. Not ''South Park''.\"<ref name=\"NYDN1029\" /> Mike Higgins of ''[[The Independent]]'' said this episode helped \"cement (Eric Cartman's) position as one of the great, obnoxious characters of the Nineties\", particularly through his Adolf Hitler Halloween costume.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Higgins |first=Mike |title=Videowatch |date=1998-11-23 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |page=10}}</ref>\n\nMatt Roush of ''[[USA Today]]'' said of the episode, \"Absurdly nihilistic and savagely derisive ...

Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[FAQ|Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett and Tim Conway) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" ([[Harvey Korman]])\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\" (Carol Burnett) \n*Finale: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSummary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

Without water, food, or any sign of rescue, they are nearly resigned to their deaths, when Vorenus notices the corpses of their dead comrades floating. The two men fashion a raft using several bodies to float it, and paddle out to sea.\n\nIn [[Julius Caesar]]'s camp, [[Mark Antony]] and a small contingent of soldiers have arrived, but the majority of the 13th Legion has been lost at sea.  [[Pompey]]'s army has Caesar pinned down, and outnumbers his forces 3 to 1.  Grimly, Caesar and Antony decide they have no choice but to make what will probably be their [[last stand]] from where they are.\n\nIn Pompey's camp, his officers consider the war all but over. Pompey knows that they need only wait, and starvation and weariness will cause Caesar's troops to desert. However, as predicted by Caesar, the politicians in the camp, led by [[Cato the Younger]], want a decisive victory and pressure Pompey to attack. Cato and [[Scipio (Rome character)|Scipio]] urge Pompey to crush Caesar in a final battle, reminding him of his reputation as a war hero. Pompey eventually gives in and agrees to attack Caesar.\n\nIn the ensuing [[Battle of Pharsalus|battle]], Caesar's forces inflict a devastating defeat on Pompey. Caesar, exhausted, staggers back into his tent and instructs [[Posca (Rome character)|Posca]] to send word of his victory to Rome, before collapsing.\n\nIn Pompey's camp, Cato and Scipio resolve to retreat to Africa and continue the war from there, although [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] wearily remarks that they are \"running out of continents\" to flee to. Sick of fighting and the constant retreats, [[Cicero]] and Brutus both declare their intentions to surrender to Caesar and beg for his mercy. \"I'm not afraid to die,\" Cicero declares in response to a sympathetic Scipio's comment they will probably be executed, \"I'm tired, and I want to go home.\"\n\nAfter they have left, Pompey consults with Scipio and Cato, and the three decide not to travel together. While the former make their way to Africa, Pompey makes his way with his wife and children to [[Amphipolis]], posing as a traveling merchant.\n\nIn Caesar's camp, Cicero and Brutus are welcomed back with open arms by an ebullient Caesar.  Befuddled, they remind him they are enemy combatants, but he will have none of it: \"We are old friends, who have merely quarrelled.\"  He invites them to share the table with the rest of his staff, who are busy celebrating the victory. Caesar is also overjoyed by their news that Pompey has survived Pharsalus, though disheartened to learn his old friend turned bitter enemy has no intention of surrendering.\n\nWhen they reach the coast, Pompey's children come across Vorenus and Pullo washed ashore.  Pullo and Vorenus recognize Pompey, though they conceal it.  Pompey's party takes them in and gives them shelter and food.\n\nOut of Pompey's earshot, the leader of his escort tries to recruit Vorenus and Pullo to help overpower Pompey's guards and take the family prisoner, promising a share of the rich reward Caesar will no doubt offer.  Pullo is all for the suggestion, but Vorenus rejects it as dishonorable.  The guide tries to ambush Vorenus, and Vorenus stabs him through the throat, alerting Pompey.  Vorenus informs Pompey that he and his family are now officially prisoners of the 13th Legion.\n\nIn private, Pompey admits to Vorenus who he is.  He tells an interested Vorenus how he was defeated at Pharsalus, then tearfully pleads that his family be allowed to make their way to freedom.  Taking pity on the old man, Vorenus lets his party go, over Pullo's objections.\n\nPullo and Vorenus make their way back to Caesar's camp. Caesar is furious that Vorenus let Pompey go, but surprises Antony by letting Vorenus off with only a reprimand. When Antony argues Vorenus should be executed for such an error, Caesar explains  that he believes Vorenus and Pullo are being protected by powerful gods, having recovered his missing [[Aquila (Roman)|Eagle]] in Gaul, stumbled upon a wagon full of treasury gold, survived a shipwreck that drowned the rest of their legion, and then found Pompey on a beach. He will not kill men \"with friends of that sort.\"\n\nIn Rome, at [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]]'s urging and [[Servilia of the Junii|Servilia]]'s invitation, [[Octavia of the Julii|Octavia]] has continued to visit Servilia's house.  At first, Octavia is the supplicant, begging on her mother's behalf for help in keeping their house safe when the news of Caesar's defeat reaches Rome.  But their positions are abruptly reversed when the news arrives that Caesar has triumphed, and Brutus's whereabouts are unknown.  Servilia collapses with tears.  Octavia comforts her, and then kisses her.  The two women are later shown lying in bed together.\n\nPompey's party makes its way from Amphipoli to [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]], confident of a warm welcome from the reigning king, [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|Ptolemy XIII]].  While Cornelia and his children watch from their boat, Pompey is rowed ashore, where he is greeted by an ex-comrade from Spain, [[Lucius Septimius]], now serving as a mercenary in the Egyptian army.  Pompey reaches out to shake Septimius's hand, but Septimius seizes his arm and stabs him in the chest, sadly stating he is acting under orders.  While Cornelia shields the children's eyes, she watches in horror as Septimius beheads Pompey and lets his corpse topple into the water.\n\n==Historical and cultural background==\n*This episode features the [[Battle of Pharsalus]], which was a decisive battle of [[Caesar's Civil War]].\n*On the beach, Septimius jokes with Pompey about needing to \"earn one's salt.\"  This modern expression originated with the Romans (according to [[Pliny the Elder]]), salt was actually used as a form of currency used to pay soldiers.  In fact, the word \"[[salary]],\" is derived from the Latin word ''salarium'', which in turn is derived from the Latin word for salt.\n*The last scene is based on [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Pompey'', which stated that Pompey was ambushed on the beach at Alexandria by members of the Egyptian King's bodyguard, including former centurion [[Lucius Septimius]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin|width=75%}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Actor\n|-\n|[[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]]\n|[[Kevin McKidd]]\n|-\n|[[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]]\n|[[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]]\n|-\n|[[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Julius Caesar]]\n|[[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]]\n|-\n|[[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus (Rome character)|Pompey Magnus]]\n|[[Kenneth Cranham]]\n|-\n|[[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]\n|[[David Bamber]]\n|-\n|[[Cato the Younger (Rome character)|Marcus Porcius Cato]]\n|[[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]]\n|-\n|[[Scipio (Rome character)|Scipio]]\n|[[Paul Jesson]]\n|-\n|[[Atia of the Julii]]\n|[[Polly Walker]]\n|-\n|[[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]]\n|[[James Purefoy]]\n|-\n|[[Marcus Junius Brutus (Rome character)|Marcus Junius Brutus]]\n|[[Tobias Menzies]]\n|-\n|[[Servilia of the Junii]]\n|[[Lindsay Duncan]]\n|-\n|[[Posca (Rome character)|Posca]]\n|[[Nicholas Woodeson]]\n|-\n|[[Octavia of the Julii]]\n|[[Kerry Condon]]\n|-\n|[[Newsreader (Rome character)|Newsreader]]\n|[[Ian McNeice]]\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Actor\n|-\n|[[Eleni (Rome character)|Eleni]]\n|[[Suzanne Bertish]]\n|-\n|[[Lyde (Rome character)|Lyde]]\n|[[Esther Hall]]\n|-\n|Pompey's Daughter\n|[[Eliza Darby]]\n|-\n|Fulvio\n|[[Daren Elliott Holmes]]\n|-\n|[[Lucius Septimius]]\n|[[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]\n|-\n|Lysandros\n|[[Vincenzo Nicoli]]\n|-\n|[[Cornelia Metella|Cornelia]]\n|[[Anna Patrick]]\n|-\n|Pompey's Son\n|[[Michele Pettini]]\n|-\n|Legionary\n|[[Francesco Sensi]]\n|-\n|Officer\n|[[Steve Swinscoe]]\n|-\n|Body Slave\n|[[Franco Troscia]]\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|episode=Pharsalus|id=0688353}}\n\n{{Rome (TV series)}}\n\n[[Category:2005 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:2005 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Rome (TV series) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the episode of the TV series \"Rome\"|the city in [[Greece]]|Farsala|the battle|Battle of Pharsalus}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Pharsalus (''Rome'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Pharsalus\n| series       = [[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 1\n| episode      = 7\n| writer       = [[David Frankel]]\n| director     = [[Tim Van Patten]]\n| airdate      = October 9, 2005 ([[HBO]])<br />December 7, 2005 ([[BBC]])<!--\n-->{{Infobox|child=yes\n| label1 = Setting\n| data1  = [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] ([[Pharsalus]]), [[Rome]], and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]\n| label2 = Time frame\n| data2  = Summer of 48 BC ([[battle of Pharsalus]] on August 9) through September 28, 48 BC\n}}\n| length       = \n| season_list  = \n| prev         = [[Egeria (Rome)|Egeria]]\n| next         = [[Caesarion (Rome)|Caesarion]]\n| episode_list = List of Rome episodes\n}}\n\n\"'''Pharsalus'''\" is the seventh episode of the first season of the television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo]] wash ashore on a small [[cay]], after their ship is lost at sea.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 11, 2005. In the episode, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] offers to help an African-American woman change the name of James Woods Regional High School to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], but his friendship with [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes strained when Peter \u2014 who objects to the idea \u2014  recruits actor [[James Woods]] to sabotage the idea. James Woods would later return for revenge in the [[Family Guy (season 6)|season 6]] episode \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\", and again for \"[[Brian Griffin's House of Payne]]\" and would eventually be killed off in the [[Family Guy (season 9)|season 9]] premiere episode \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", but is later revealed to have survived his death in the [[Family Guy (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]\".\n\nDirected by [[Peter Shin]], Chuck Klein and [[Zac Moncrief]] and written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], the episode was initially scheduled for September 18, 2005, but was aired a week earlier due to Fox delaying the broadcast of the episode \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\" over sensitivity for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims. It features guest performances from [[Gary Cole]], [[Michael Dorn]], Susana Esteban, [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], [[Gabrielle Union]], [[Wally Wingert]], and [[James Woods]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series. \"Peter's Got Woods\" was seen by approximately 9.22 million viewers during its original broadcast, and it received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] asks [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to go to a PTA meeting in her place; Peter asks [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] to go in his place. Brian reluctantly attends, but he falls in love with one of Meg's teachers (played by [[Gabrielle Union]]) named Shauna Parks (a reference to [[Rosa Parks]]), who is black. They go out on a date, and Brian, attempting to win her over, suggests changing the name of James Woods Regional High School to honor [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Shauna likes Brian's idea, and the board holds a meeting to consider the name change. However Peter is a James Woods fan and sees through the trick. He tries to protest the idea but Brian denies the fact that he is doing it for love and not to really honor the Civil Rights Movement. As a James Woods fan, Peter brings James Woods himself to the school during the name-changing to sabotage the effort.\n\nWoods permits them to change the name and impressed by his humbleness, the school reinstates the name to the James Woods Regional High School. Brian gets furious with Peter for sabotaging the attempt to change the name of the high school and continues his denial of just wanting to impress his girlfriend and her race. However, Peter exposes Brian and points out the ruse by saying that Brian could have named it after [[Ronald Reagan]] rather than anybody from the Civil Rights Movement. In reply to this Brian and Peter end their friendship.\n\nTo replace Brian as a friend, Peter becomes BFFs with Woods and the two spend their days giving gifts, sculpting themselves up with trees, riding bikes, camping in the backyard, wrestling in their tent like two children, etc. (during this time Peter and Woods sing a parody of \"You Two\" from ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'').\n\nOne day during a date at the movie theatre Brian is forced to admit to Shauna that he is still loyal to Peter. Shauna however hates Peter for sabotaging them and makes Brian choose between her or Peter. Brian likewise chooses to remain loyal to Peter and they break up. Noticing the situation [[Mayor Adam West]], as a joke, offers Brian popcorn to cheer him up but Brian sees cream corn in the popcorn bag.\n\nWhen Brian comes back home he sees that his life has been given to [[James Woods]]. Woods sleeps on the bed with Peter and Lois, Peter and Woods now play fetch with each other and they act as if they do not see Brian as their friend or relative anymore. Over time Peter and Brian get bored without each other and they decide to reconcile. However Peter notices that Woods has become obsessive with their friendship enough that Woods goes into a tirade at Peter for missing 5 minutes of a dinner. To defeat Woods, Peter and Brian plant a trap baited with pieces of Reese's peanut candy ending in a crate. The plan works and Woods ends up being locked up in a crate and examined by \"top men.\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:James_Woods_2015.jpg|thumb|[[James Woods]] voiced himself]]\nThe episode was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and was directed by [[Peter Shin]], Chuck Klein, and [[Zac Moncrief]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 4)|fourth production season]].<ref name=film>{{cite web|url= http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-5-2005/episode-1-peters-got-woods/14649467|publisher=[[Film.com]]|title=Peter's Got Woods |accessdate=2009-12-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922212740/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-5-2005/episode-1-peters-got-woods/14649467 |archivedate=2008-09-22}}</ref> The episode was initially scheduled for September 18, 2005 but was aired a week earlier<ref name=film/> due to FOX delaying the broadcast of the episode \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\" over sensitivity for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims, as the episode made many jokes about [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Benson|first=Jim|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6255478.html|title=Fox Holds Family Guy With Hurricane References|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=2005-09-08}}</ref> Although most episodes of ''Family Guy'' are rated TV-14, \"Peter's Got Woods\" was rated TV-PG.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/schedule/showinfo/familyguy/fg_414.htm |title=FOX Fall Schedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203010846/http://www.fox.com/schedule/showinfo/familyguy/fg_414.htm|archivedate=February 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actors [[Gary Cole]], [[Michael Dorn]], Susana Esteban, [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], [[Gabrielle Union]], [[Wally Wingert]], and [[James Woods]].<ref name=film/> In a cutaway of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', actors [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Jonathan Frakes]], and [[Michael Dorn]] reprised their roles of Captain Picard, Commander Riker, and Lt.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 11, 2005. In the episode, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] offers to help an African-American woman change the name of James Woods Regional High School to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], but his friendship with [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes strained when Peter \u2014 who objects to the idea \u2014  recruits actor [[James Woods]] to sabotage the idea. James Woods would later return for revenge in the [[Family Guy (season 6)|season 6]] episode \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\", and again for \"[[Brian Griffin's House of Payne]]\" and would eventually be killed off in the [[Family Guy (season 9)|season 9]] premiere episode \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", but is later revealed to have survived his death in the [[Family Guy (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]\".\n\nDirected by [[Peter Shin]], Chuck Klein and [[Zac Moncrief]] and written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], the episode was initially scheduled for September 18, 2005, but was aired a week earlier due to Fox delaying the broadcast of the episode \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\" over sensitivity for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims. It features guest performances from [[Gary Cole]], [[Michael Dorn]], Susana Esteban, [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], [[Gabrielle Union]], [[Wally Wingert]], and [[James Woods]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series. \"Peter's Got Woods\" was seen by approximately 9.22 million viewers during its original broadcast, and it received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] asks [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to go to a PTA meeting in her place; Peter asks [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] to go in his place. Brian reluctantly attends, but he falls in love with one of Meg's teachers (played by [[Gabrielle Union]]) named Shauna Parks (a reference to [[Rosa Parks]]), who is black. They go out on a date, and Brian, attempting to win her over, suggests changing the name of James Woods Regional High School to honor [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Shauna likes Brian's idea, and the board holds a meeting to consider the name change. However Peter is a James Woods fan and sees through the trick. He tries to protest the idea but Brian denies the fact that he is doing it for love and not to really honor the Civil Rights Movement. As a James Woods fan, Peter brings James Woods himself to the school during the name-changing to sabotage the effort.\n\nWoods permits them to change the name and impressed by his humbleness, the school reinstates the name to the James Woods Regional High School. Brian gets furious with Peter for sabotaging the attempt to change the name of the high school and continues his denial of just wanting to impress his girlfriend and her race. However, Peter exposes Brian and points out the ruse by saying that Brian could have named it after [[Ronald Reagan]] rather than anybody from the Civil Rights Movement. In reply to this Brian and Peter end their friendship.\n\nTo replace Brian as a friend, Peter becomes BFFs with Woods and the two spend their days giving gifts, sculpting themselves up with trees, riding bikes, camping in the backyard, wrestling in their tent like two children, etc. (during this time Peter and Woods sing a parody of \"You Two\" from ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'').\n\nOne day during a date at the movie theatre Brian is forced to admit to Shauna that he is still loyal to Peter. Shauna however hates Peter for sabotaging them and makes Brian choose between her or Peter. Brian likewise chooses to remain loyal to Peter and they break up. Noticing the situation [[Mayor Adam West]], as a joke, offers Brian popcorn to cheer him up but Brian sees cream corn in the popcorn bag.\n\nWhen Brian comes back home he sees that his life has been given to [[James Woods]]. Woods sleeps on the bed with Peter and Lois, Peter and Woods now play fetch with each other and they act as if they do not see Brian as their friend or relative anymore. Over time Peter and Brian get bored without each other and they decide to reconcile. However Peter notices that Woods has become obsessive with their friendship enough that Woods goes into a tirade at Peter for missing 5 minutes of a dinner. To defeat Woods, Peter and Brian plant a trap baited with pieces of Reese's peanut candy ending in a crate. The plan works and Woods ends up being locked up in a crate and examined by \"top men.\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:James_Woods_2015.jpg|thumb|[[James Woods]] voiced himself]]\nThe episode was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and was directed by [[Peter Shin]], Chuck Klein, and [[Zac Moncrief]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 4)|fourth production season]].<ref name=film>{{cite web|url= http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-5-2005/episode-1-peters-got-woods/14649467|publisher=[[Film.com]]|title=Peter's Got Woods |accessdate=2009-12-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922212740/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-5-2005/episode-1-peters-got-woods/14649467 |archivedate=2008-09-22}}</ref> The episode was initially scheduled for September 18, 2005 but was aired a week earlier<ref name=film/> due to FOX delaying the broadcast of the episode \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\" over sensitivity for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims, as the episode made many jokes about [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Benson|first=Jim|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6255478.html|title=Fox Holds Family Guy With Hurricane References|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=2005-09-08}}</ref> Although most episodes of ''Family Guy'' are rated TV-14, \"Peter's Got Woods\" was rated TV-PG.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/schedule/showinfo/familyguy/fg_414.htm |title=FOX Fall Schedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203010846/http://www.fox.com/schedule/showinfo/familyguy/fg_414.htm|archivedate=February 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actors [[Gary Cole]], [[Michael Dorn]], Susana Esteban, [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], [[Gabrielle Union]], [[Wally Wingert]], and [[James Woods]].<ref name=film/> In a cutaway of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', actors [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Jonathan Frakes]], and [[Michael Dorn]] reprised their roles of Captain Picard, Commander Riker, and Lt.

Assigned to [[Mandatory Palestine]], he became a supporter of [[Zionism]], and set up a joint British-Jewish counter-insurgency unit. Under the patronage of the area commander [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], Wingate was given increasing latitude to put his ideas into practice during World War II. He created units in [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and Burma.\n\nAt a time when Britain was in need of morale-boosting generalship, Wingate attracted [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]'s attention with a self-reliant aggressive philosophy of war, and was given resources to stage a large-scale operation. The last Chindit campaign may have determined the outcome of the [[Battle of Kohima]], although the offensive into India by the Japanese may have occurred because Wingate's first operation had demonstrated the possibility of moving through the jungle. In practice, both Japanese and British forces suffered severe supply problems and malnutrition.\n\nWingate was killed in an aircraft accident late in the war. The casualty rate the Chindits suffered, especially from disease, is a continuing controversy. Wingate believed that resistance to infection could be improved by inculcating a tough mental attitude, but medical officers considered his methods unsuited to a tropical environment.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nWingate, the eldest of three sons, was born on 26 February 1903 at [[Nainital|Naini Tal]] near [[Almora]] in Kumaon, India, into a military family (cousins of the [[Wingate baronets]]).<ref>Bodyguard of Lies, Anthony Cave Brown, Harper and Row, 1975, p. 8</ref><ref>Wingate Pasha: The Life of General Sir Francis Reginald Wingate 1861-1953, R.

For the first 12 years of his life, he socialised primarily with his siblings.<ref name=\"Rooney14\"/> The seven Wingate children received a Christian education that was typical for that period, and time was set aside each day for studying and memorising the Scriptures.<ref name=\"Rooney14\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, his family moved to [[Godalming]] where Wingate attended [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] as a day boy. He did not board at the school nor did he participate in the activities of a public school education. Instead, he was kept busy at home by his parents, who encouraged their children to tackle challenging projects which fostered independent thought, initiative, and self-reliance.<ref>{{harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=15}}</ref>\n\n==Early army career==\nAfter four years, Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was accepted at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Woolwich]], the [[Royal Artillery]]'s officers' training school. For committing a minor offence against the rules, a first-year student would be subjected to a [[ragging]] ritual named \"running\". This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to [[Running the gauntlet|run a gauntlet]] of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water.\n\nWhen it came time for Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, he walked up to the senior student at the head of the gauntlet, stared at him and dared him to strike.  The senior refused. Wingate moved to the next senior and did the same; he too refused. In turn, each senior declined to strike; coming to the end of the line, Wingate walked to the cistern and dived straight into the icy-cold water.<ref name=\"Rooney17\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Wingate received his Royal Artillery [[commissioned officer|officer's commission]]{{sfn|Gazette|32858}} and was posted to the 5th Medium Brigade at [[Larkhill]] on [[Salisbury Plain]].<ref name=\"Rooney17\"/> During this period, he was able to exercise his great interest in horse riding, gaining a reputation for his skill (and great success) in point-to-point races and fox hunting, particularly for finding suitable places to cross rivers, which earned him the nickname \"Otter\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=18}}</ref> It was difficult for a 1920s army officer to live on his pay and Wingate, living life to the full, also gained a reputation as a late payer of his bills.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=19}}</ref>\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant on 29 August 1925.{{sfn|Gazette|33079}} In 1926, because of his prowess in riding, Wingate was posted to the [[Military School of Equitation]] where he excelled, much to the chagrin of the majority of the [[cavalry]] officers at the centre who found him insufferable; he frequently challenged the instructors as a demonstration of his rebellious nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=20}}</ref>\n\n==Sudan, 1928\u20131933==\nWingate's father's cousin, Sir [[Reginald Wingate]], a retired army general who had been governor-general of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] between 1899 and 1916 and high commissioner of Egypt from 1917 to 1919, had a considerable influence on Wingate's career.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> He gave him a positive interest in Middle East affairs and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. As a result, Wingate applied to take a course in Arabic at the [[School of Oriental Studies]] in London and passed out of the course, which lasted from October 1926 to March 1927, with a mark of 85/100.<ref name=\"Rooney21\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=21}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1927, with Cousin Rex's encouragement, Wingate obtained six months' leave in order to mount an expedition in the Sudan. Rex had suggested that he travel via Cairo and then try to obtain [[secondment]] to the [[Sudan Defence Force]].<ref name=\"Rooney21\"/> Sending his luggage ahead of him, Wingate set off in September 1927 by bicycle, travelling first through France and Germany before making his way to [[Genoa]] via [[Czechoslovakia]], Austria and [[Yugoslavia]]. From Genoa he took a boat to Egypt. From [[Cairo]] he travelled to [[Khartoum]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=22}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1928, his application to transfer to the Sudan Defence Force came through and he was posted to the East Arab Corps, serving in the area of [[Roseires]] and [[Gallabat]] on the borders of [[Ethiopia]], where the SDF patrolled to catch [[slavery|slave]] traders and [[ivory]] [[poaching|poachers]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> He changed the method of regular patrolling to [[ambush]]es.\n\nIn March 1930, Wingate was given command of a company of 300 soldiers with the local rank of ''bimbashi'' ([[major (United Kingdom)|major]]). He was never happier than when in the bush with his unit, but when at HQ in Khartoum, he antagonised the other officers with his aggressive and argumentative personality.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=23}}</ref> He was granted the local rank of captain in the regular army on 16 April 1930.{{sfn|Gazette|33664}}\n\nAt the end of his tour, Wingate mounted a short expedition into the Libyan desert to investigate the lost army of [[Cambyses]], mentioned in the writings of [[Herodotus]], and to search for the lost oasis of [[Zerzura]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=24}}</ref> Supported by equipment from the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (the findings of the expedition were published in the ''Royal Geographical Magazine'' in April 1934) and the Sudan Survey Department, the expedition set off in January 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=25}}</ref> Although they did not find the oasis, Wingate saw the expedition as an opportunity to test his endurance in a very harsh physical environment, and also his organisational and leadership abilities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=26}}</ref> He concluded his service in the Sudan on 2 April 1933.{{sfn|Gazette|33963}}\n\n==Return to the UK, 1933\u20131936==\nOn his return to the UK in 1933, Wingate was posted to [[Bulford Camp|Bulford]] on [[Salisbury Plain]] and was heavily involved in retraining, as British artillery units were being mechanised.<ref name=\"Rooney27\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=27}}</ref> On the sea voyage from Egypt he met Lorna Moncrieff Patterson, who was 16 years old and travelling with her mother.

[[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] guerrillas had at the time of his arrival begun a [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|campaign of attacks]] against both British mandate officials and [[Jews|Jewish]] communities.\n\nWingate became politically involved with a number of Zionist leaders, and became an ardent Zionist himself.<ref name=\"Masters161\">{{Harvnb |Masters|1979|p=161}}</ref>  He always returned to Kibbutz [[Ein Harod|En Harod]]\u2014because he felt familiar with the biblical judge [[Gideon]], who fought in this area, and used it himself as a military base. He formulated the idea of raising small assault units of British-led Jewish commandos armed with grenades and light infantry small arms to combat the Arab revolt. Wingate took his idea personally to Wavell, who was then the commander of British forces in Palestine.\n\nAfter Wavell gave his permission, Wingate convinced the Zionist [[Jewish Agency]] and the leadership of [[Haganah]], the Jewish armed group.  In June 1938, the new British commander, General [[Robert Haining|Haining]], gave his permission to create the [[Special Night Squads]], armed groups formed of British and Haganah volunteers. The Jewish Agency helped pay salaries and other costs of the Haganah personnel.\n\nWingate trained, commanded and accompanied them on their patrols. The units frequently ambushed Arab saboteurs who attacked oil [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s of the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], raiding border villages the attackers had used as bases. In these raids, Wingate's men sometimes imposed severe [[collective punishment]]s on the villagers, which was criticised by Zionist leaders as well as Wingate's British superiors.\n\nWingate disliked Arabs, once shouting at Haganah fighters after a June 1938 attack on a village on the border between Mandatory Palestine and Lebanon, \"I think you are all totally ignorant in your Ramat Yochanan [the training base for the Haganah] since you do not even know the elementary use of bayonets when attacking dirty Arabs: how can you put your left foot in front?\"{{#tag:ref|The quote is part of Amatziya Cohen's recollection of Wingate's tutelage.{{sfn|Papp\u00e9|2006|p=16}}|group=lower-alpha}} But the brutal tactics proved effective in quelling the uprising, and Wingate was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] in 1938.\n\nHowever, his deepening direct political involvement with the Zionist cause and an incident where he spoke publicly in favour of the formation of a Jewish state during his leave in Britain, caused his superiors in Palestine to remove him from command. He was so deeply associated with political causes in Palestine that his superiors considered him compromised as an intelligence officer in the country. He was promoting his own agenda rather than that of the army or the government. In May 1939, he was transferred to Britain. Wingate became a hero of the [[Yishuv]] (the Jewish Community), and was loved by leaders such as [[Zvi Brenner]] and [[Moshe Dayan]], who had trained under him and who claimed that Wingate had \"taught us everything we know.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IC04DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT152&dq=crucible+dayan+wingate+we+know&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzlcPp6_LeAhWOEVAKHQXHD1YQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=crucible%20dayan%20wingate%20we%20know&f=false Crucible], Jonathan Fenby</ref> Wingate's political attitudes toward Zionism were heavily influenced by his [[Plymouth Brethren]] religious views and belief in certain [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] doctrines.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Ethiopia and Gideon Force==\n[[File:Orde Wingate Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|Orde Wingate enters Addis Ababa on horseback.]]\nWingate was the commander of an anti-aircraft unit in Britain when [[World War II]] began. He repeatedly made proposals to the army and government for the creation of a Jewish army in Palestine which would rule over the area and its Arab population in the name of the British. His friend Wavell was commander-in-chief of [[Middle East Command]] based in [[Cairo]], and he invited him to Sudan to begin operations against Italian occupation forces in Ethiopia. He created [[Gideon Force]] under [[William Platt]], the British commander in Sudan, a [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) force composed of British, Sudanese, and Ethiopian soldiers.  At Khartoum, he and Tony Simonds joined Mission 101 controlled by London and Cairo.  \n[[File:Haile Selassie, Emperor of Abyssinia, with Brigadier Daniel Arthur Sandford (left) and Colonel Wingate (right) in Dambacha Fort, after it had been captured, 15 April 1941.

The Italians occupied Ethiopia between 1936 and 1941, and they conducted operations to \"pacify\" the people which killed about seven percent of the population.{{sfn|Sullivan|1999|p=188}} There was a huge reservoir of hatred for the Italians as a result, and many Ethiopians were happy to assist Gideon Force. Wingate was temporarily promoted lieutenant colonel and put in command. He again insisted on leading from the front and accompanied his troops in the reconquest of Abyssinia.\n\nGideon Force harassed Italian forts and their supply lines with the aid of local resistance fighters, while regular army units took on the main Italian army. A small force of no more than 1,700 men took the surrender of about 20,000 Italians toward the end of the campaign. At the end of the fighting, Wingate and the men of Gideon Force linked with the force of Lt. Gen. [[Alan Cunningham]] which had advanced from Kenya in the south, and they accompanied the emperor in his triumphant return to [[Addis Ababa]] that May. Wingate was mentioned in dispatches in April 1941 and was awarded a second DSO in December.\n\nWith the end of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] on 4 June 1941, Wingate was removed from command of the dismantled Gideon Force and his rank reduced to that of major. During the campaign, he was irritated that British authorities ignored a request for decorations for his men. They also obstructed his efforts to obtain back pay and other compensation. He left for Cairo and wrote an official report which was extremely critical of his commanders, fellow officers, government officials, and many others. He was also angry that his efforts had not been praised by authorities and that he had been forced to leave Abyssinia without saying farewell to Emperor Selassie. He was most concerned about British attempts to stifle Ethiopian freedom, writing that attempts to raise future rebellions amongst populations must be honest ones and should appeal to justice.\n\nWingate contracted [[malaria]] soon after this and sought treatment from a local doctor instead of army medical staff because he was afraid that the illness would give his detractors a further excuse to undermine him. This doctor gave him a large supply of the drug [[Atabrine]], which can produce [[Clinical depression|depression]] as a side-effect if taken in high dosages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=73}}</ref> Wingate was already depressed by the official response to his Abyssinian command, and he was also sick with malaria; he attempted suicide by stabbing himself in the neck.<ref name=\"Masters161\"/> Only prompt action by another officer saved him,{{sfn|Rooney|1999|pp=190\u2013191}} and he was sent to Britain to recuperate.\n\nA highly edited version of his report was passed to [[Winston Churchill]] through his political supporters in London, and Secretary of State for India [[Leo Amery]] contacted Wavell, Commander-in-Chief in India commanding the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian Theatre]] to enquire if there were any chance of employing Wingate in the Far East. Wingate was far from pleased with his posting as a \"supernumary major without staff grading\", but he left Britain for [[Rangoon]] on 27 February 1942.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=75}}</ref>\n\n==Burma==\n===Chindits and the first long-range jungle penetration mission===\n[[File:The British Army in Burma in 1943 IND2237.jpg|thumb|right|Wingate after his return from operations in Japanese-occupied Burma in 1943]]\nWingate was appointed colonel once more by General Wavell upon arrival in the [[Far East]] in March 1942, and he was ordered to organise guerrilla units to fight behind Japanese lines. However, the precipitate collapse of Allied defences in Burma forestalled further planning, and he flew back to India in April where he began to promote his ideas for jungle [[long-range penetration]] units.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=76}}</ref> \"Never ask favours\", he recalled from his long association with Wavell, \"but tell people if they care to help they can come along, that you yourself are going anyway\".<ref>Wingate quoted in J.

Foot, ''SOE'' (1984), p. 9 {{full citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=Both citation, or [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]}}</ref>\n\nWavell was intrigued by Wingate's theories and gave him the (Indian 77th Infantry Brigade), from which he created a jungle long-range penetration unit. 77 Brigade was eventually named the [[Chindits]], a corrupted version of a mythical Burmese lion called the ''[[chinthe]]''.  By August 1942, he had set up a training centre at [[Dhana]] near Saugor district in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and attempted to toughen up the men by having them camp in the Indian jungle during the rainy season.  This proved disastrous, as the result was a very high sickness rate among the men. In one battalion, 70 percent of the men went absent from duty due to illness, while a [[Gurkha]] battalion was reduced from 750 men to 500.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=77}}</ref> Many of the men were replaced in September 1942 by new drafts of personnel from elsewhere in the army.\n\nMeanwhile, he won few friends among the officer corps with his direct manner of dealing with fellow officers and superiors, along with eccentric personal habits. He would eat raw onions because he thought that they were healthy, scrub himself with a rubber brush instead of bathing, and greet visitors to his tent while completely naked.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=164}}</ref> Wavell's political connections and patronage protected him from closer scrutiny, for he admired Wingate's work in the Abyssinian campaign, but Wingate remained the regimental gadfly always ready to flout the King's regulations; he grew a beard in the jungle and allowed his men to do the same. Nevertheless, he won plaudits by his outstanding courage and leadership in the face of the enemy.<ref>T.Holt, The Deceivers, vol.

Wingate then persuaded Wavell to let him proceed into Burma anyway, arguing the need to disrupt any Japanese attack on [[Sumprabum]] as well as to gauge the utility of long-range jungle penetration operations, and Wavell eventually gave his consent to ''Operation Longcloth''.<ref name=\"Rooney81\">{{Harvnb |Rooney|2000|p=81}}</ref> Wingate set out from [[Imphal]] on 12 February 1943 with the Chindits organised into eight separate columns to cross the [[Chindwin river]].<ref name=\"Rooney81\"/> The force met with initial success in putting one of the main railways in Burma out of action, then Wingate led them deep into Burma and over the [[Irrawaddy River]]. However, they found conditions very different from what their intelligence had led them to expect. The area was dry and inhospitable and criss-crossed by motor roads which the Japanese were able to use to good effect, particularly by intercepting supply drops to the Chindits. They soon began to suffer severely from exhaustion and shortages of water and food.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=88}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March, Eastern Army HQ ordered Wingate to withdraw his units back to India. He and his senior commanders considered a number of options to achieve this, but all were threatened by the fact that the Japanese would be able to focus their attention on destroying the Chindit force, having no major army offensive in progress. They finally agreed to retrace their steps to the Irrawaddy, since the Japanese would not expect this, and then disperse to make attacks on the enemy as they returned to the Chindwin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=91}}</ref> By mid-March, the Japanese had three infantry divisions chasing the Chindits, who were eventually trapped inside the bend of the [[Shweli River]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Masters|1979|pp=134\u201335}}</ref> They were unable to cross the river intact and still reach British lines, so they split into small groups to evade enemy forces. The Japanese paid great attention to preventing air resupply of Chindit columns, as well as hindering their mobility by removing boats from the Irrawaddy, Chindwin, and Mu rivers and actively patrolling the river banks.<ref name=\"Rooney99\">{{Harvnb |Rooney|2000|p=99}}</ref> The force returned to India by various routes during the spring of 1943 in groups ranging from single individuals to whole columns: some directly, others via a roundabout route from China, and always harassed by the Japanese.<ref name=\"Masters135\">{{Harvnb |Masters|1979|p=135}}</ref> Casualties were high, and the force lost approximately one-third of its total strength.<ref name=\"Masters135\"/>\n\n===After-battle analysis===\nWith the losses incurred during the first long-range jungle penetration operation, many officers in the British and Indian army questioned the overall value of the Chindits. The campaign had the unintended effect of convincing the Japanese that certain sections of the Burma/India Frontier were not as impassable as they previously believed, thus altering their strategic plans. As one consequence, the overall Japanese Army commander in Burma, Gen. [[Masakazu Kawabe]], began planning a 1944 offensive into India to capture the Imphal Plain and Kohima, in order to better defend Burma from future Allied offensives.<ref name=\"Rooney99\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=155}}</ref>\n\nIn London, the Chindits and their exploits were viewed as a success after the long string of Allied disasters in the Far East theatre. [[Winston Churchill]], an ardent proponent of commando operations, was, in particular, complimentary toward the Chindits and their accomplishments. The Japanese subsequently admitted that the Chindits had disrupted their plans for the first half of 1943.<ref name=\"Rooney99\"/>\n\nAs a propaganda tool, the Chindit operation was used to prove to the army and those at home that the Japanese could be beaten and that British/Indian troops could successfully operate in the jungle against experienced Japanese forces. On his return, Wingate wrote an operations report in which he was again highly critical of the army and even some of his own officers and men.  He also promoted more unorthodox ideas such as the idea that British soldiers had become weak by having too easy access to doctors in civilian life.  The report was again passed through back channels by Wingate's political friends in London directly to Churchill.  The Prime Minister then invited Wingate to London for talks.\n\nSoon after Wingate arrived, Churchill decided to take him and his wife along to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]].{{#tag:ref|British [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[Alan Brooke]] was astonished at this decision. In his ''War Diaries'', Brooke wrote after his interview with Wingate in London on 4 August: \"I was very interested in meeting Wingate&nbsp;...  I considered that the results of his form of attacks were certainly worth backing within reason&nbsp;...  I provided him with all the contacts in England to obtain what he wanted, and told him that on my return from Canada I would go into the whole matter with him&nbsp;... [later] to my astonishment I was informed that Winston was taking Wingate and his wife with him to Canada! It could only be as a museum piece to impress the Americans! There was no other reason to justify this move. It was sheer loss of time for Wingate and the work he had to do in England\".<ref>{{Harvnb |Alanbrooke|2001|p=436 entry for 4 August 1943).}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} There, Wingate explained his ideas of deep penetration warfare to the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] meeting on 17 August.{{#tag:ref|Brooke wrote on 17 August: \"Quite a good meeting at which I produced Wingate who gave a first class talk of his ideas and of his views on the running of the Burma campaign\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Alanbrooke|2001|p=443.}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} Air power, radio, and recent developments in warfare would allow units to establish bases deep in enemy territory, breaching the outer defences, and extend the range of conventional forces. The leaders were impressed, and larger scale deep-penetration attacks were approved. By now, a war-substantive lieutenant-colonel and temporary brigadier, Wingate was promoted to the acting rank of major-general on 18 September 1943.{{sfn|Gazette|36194}}\n\n===Second long-range jungle penetration mission===\n[[File:Chindit leaders Burma 1944 IWM MH 7873.jpg|thumb|right|Wingate with Chindit leaders.]]\nAfter his meeting with Allied leaders, Wingate contracted [[typhoid]] by drinking water from a flower vase in a Cairo hotel while on his way back to India. Doctors were shocked as it was drummed into every serviceman that they should never use such a source as drinking water. His illness prevented him from taking a more active role in training of the new long-range jungle forces.\n\nWhile Wingate was still in Burma, Wavell had ordered the formation of 111 Brigade, known as the \"Leopards\", along the lines of the 77 Brigade. He selected Brigadier [[Joe Lentaigne]] as the new commander.<ref name=\"Masters135\"/> Wavell intended that the two brigades would operate with one engaged on operations while the other trained and prepared for the next operation. However, once back in India, Wingate was promoted to acting major general and was given six brigades. This involved breaking up the experienced [[70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|70th Division]], which other commanders felt could be better used as a standard \"line\" division.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1984|p=319}}</ref> At first, Wingate proposed to convert the entire front into one giant Chindit mission by breaking up the whole of the Fourteenth Army into Long-Range Penetration units, presumably in the expectation that the Japanese would follow them around the Burmese jungle in an effort to wipe them out.<ref name=\"Masters163\">{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=163}}</ref> This plan was hurriedly dropped after other commanders pointed out that the Japanese Army would simply advance and seize the air bases from which Chindit forces were supplied, requiring a defensive battle and substantial troops that the Indian Army would be unable to provide.<ref name=\"Masters163\"/>\n\nIn the end, a new long-range jungle penetration operation was planned, this time using all six of the brigades recently allocated to Wingate. The second long-range penetration mission was originally intended as a coordinated effort with a planned regular army offensive against northern Burma, but events on the ground resulted in cancellation of the army offensive, leaving the long-range penetration groups without a means of transporting all six brigades into Burma. Upon Wingate's return to India, he found that his mission had also been cancelled for lack of air transport. Wingate took the news bitterly, voicing disappointment to all who would listen, including Allied commanders such as Colonel [[Philip Cochran]] of the 1st Air Commando Group, which proved to be a blessing in disguise. Cochran told Wingate that cancelling the long-range mission was unnecessary; only a limited amount of aerial transport would be needed since, in addition to the light planes and [[C-47 Dakota]]s Wingate had counted on, Cochran explained that 1st Air Commando had 150 gliders to haul supplies: \"Wingate\u2019s dark eyes widened as Phil explained that the gliders could also move a sizable force of troops. The general immediately spread a map on the floor and planned how his Chindits, airlifted deep into the jungle, could fan out from there and fight the Japanese\".{{sfn|Allison|2011}}\n\nWith his new glider landing option, Wingate decided to proceed into Burma anyway. The character of the 1944 operations differed from those of 1943 in that they aimed to establish fortified bases in Burma out of which the Chindits would conduct offensive patrol and blocking operations. A similar strategy would be used by the French in Indochina years later at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]].\n\n===Operation Thursday===\nWingate planned that part of 77 Brigade would land by glider in Burma and prepare airstrips into which 111 Brigade and the remainder of 77 Brigade would be flown by [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport aircraft. Three landing sites, codenamed \"Piccadilly\", \"Broadway\" and \"Chowringhee\" were selected. On the evening of 5 March as Wingate, Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Slim]] (the commander of Fourteenth Army), Brigadier [[Michael Calvert]] (the commander of 77 Brigade) and Cochrane waited at an airfield in India for 77 Brigade to fly into \"Piccadilly\", an incident occurred which Wingate's critics later claimed to show his lack of firmness or balance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=170}}</ref>\n\nWingate had forbidden continuous reconnaissance of the landing sites to avoid compromising the security of the operation, but Cochrane ordered a last-minute reconnaissance flight which showed \"Piccadilly\" to be completely obstructed with logs. By Slim's account, Wingate became highly emotional and insisted that the operation had been betrayed, and that the Japanese would have set up ambushes on the other two landing sites. He passed the responsibility for ordering the operation to proceed or to be cancelled to Slim.<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|p=257}}</ref>\n\nSlim ordered that the operation was to go ahead. Wingate then ordered that 77 Brigade would fly into \"Chowringhee\". Both Cochrane and Calvert objected, as \"Chowringhee\" was on the wrong side of the Irrawaddy and Cochrane's pilots were not familiar with the layout. Eventually, \"Broadway\" was selected instead. The landings were initially a failure, as many gliders crashed ''en route'' or on \"Broadway\", but Calvert's brigade soon made the landing ground fit to take aircraft, and sent the success signal. It was later found that the logs on \"Piccadilly\" had been laid there to dry by Burmese teak loggers.<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|p=261}}</ref>\n\nOnce all the Chindit brigades (less one which remained in India) had marched or flown into Burma, they established base areas and drop zones behind Japanese lines. By fortunate timing, the Japanese launched an invasion of India around the same time. By forcing several [[pitched battle]]s along their line of march, the Chindit columns were able to disrupt the Japanese offensive, diverting troops from the battles in India.\n\nThe value of Wingate's Chindits has been disputed. Field Marshal [[William Slim]] argued that special forces in general had an overall negative effect on the prosecution of war by separating the best-trained and most committed troops from the main army.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=546\u2013549}}  However, Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]], a Chindit who went on to become one of \"world's leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency\",{{sfn|Times staff|1992}} wrote in his autobiography that \"Every time I look at the picture of General Slim and his Corps Commanders being knighted by Lord Wavell as Viceroy on the field of battle after Imphal, I see the ghost of Wingate present. He was unquestionably one of the great men of [the 20th] century\".{{sfn|Thompson|1989|p=76}}\n\nRegarding Operation Thursday, historian Raymond Callahan, author of ''Churchill and His Generals'' argues that \"Wingate\u2019s ideas were flawed in many respects. For one thing, the Imperial Japanese Army did not have Western-style supply lines to disrupt, and tended to ignore logistics generally. When Special Force launched itself into Burma in March 1944, Wingate\u2019s ideas, so enchantingly laid out for Churchill, rapidly proved unworkable.\"<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/841-the-strange-case-of-the-prime-minister-and-the-fighting-prophetRaymond Callahan, \"The Strange Case of the Prime Minister and the Fighting Prophet\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219051715/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/841-the-strange-case-of-the-prime-minister-and-the-fighting-prophetRaymond |date=19 February 2014 }}</ref> However, the Japanese commander, [[Mutaguchi Renya]], later stated that Operation Thursday had a significant effect on the campaign, saying \"The Chindit invasion&nbsp;... had a decisive effect on these operations&nbsp;... they drew off the whole of 53 Division and parts of 15 Division, one regiment of which would have turned the scales at Kohima\".{{sfn|Anglim|2009|p={{page needed|date=May 2017}} }}\n\n==Death in India==\nOn 24 March 1944, Wingate flew to assess the situations in three Chindit-held bases in Burma.

The exhumation was possible due to a three-way agreement among the governments of India, United Kingdom and the United States, and in accordance with the families' wishes.\n\n==Eccentricities==\nWingate was known for various [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]]ities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw onions and [[garlic]] on a string around his neck, which he would occasionally bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him come out of the shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Sometimes Wingate would eat only [[grape]]s and onions.<ref>Caufield, Catherine. (1981). ''The Emperor of the United States of America and Other Magnificent British Eccentrics''.

In Israel, Wingate's role with creating and leading the SNS, which become the prototype of the Israeli Defense Forces has made him a national hero, a man celebrated for his Zionism and courage, in the words of the Israeli historian [[Michael Oren]] a \"heroic, larger-than-life figure to whom the Jewish people owed a deep and enduring debt\".<ref name=\"Orlen\"/>\n\nThe two most popular Israeli books about Wingate, both written by SNS veterans were ''In the Path of Fighters'' by Israel Carmi and ''Orde Wingate: His Life and Works'' by Avraham Akavia.<ref name=\"Orlen\"/> By contrast, Palestinian historians portrayed Wingate very negatively as a thuggish fanatic who terrorized Palestinian villages during the Arab Revolt.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|p=2}}\n\nIn recent years, the Israeli [[New Historians]] have taken a critical picture of Wingate with [[Tom Segev]] calling him \"quite mad, and perhaps a sadist, too\u201d and a war criminal.<ref name=\"Orlen\"/> Oren has accused Segev of maligning Wingate, arguing that Segev has \"edited\" accounts by contemporaries to imply that Wingate was present at incidents in Palestine when he was in London at the time.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|pp=91\u201392}}\n\n==Family==\nOrde Wingate had a wife, Lorna, and a son, Lt Col Orde Jonathan Wingate, who joined the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] after a regular Army career in the Royal Artillery and became the regiment's commanding officer and later regimental colonel. He died in 2000 at the age of 56,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1372902/Lt-Col-Orde-Wingate.html|title=Lt-Col Orde Wingate|date=2000-11-03|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and was survived by his wife and two daughters.\n\nHe was also related to [[Reginald Wingate]] and [[Ronald Wingate]]. The [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], Sir [[William Dobbie]], was his uncle.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In 1976, the [[BBC]] produced a three-part drama called ''Orde Wingate'', based on his life, in which he was played by [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]. The programme was made on a limited budget with reduced or stylized settings. It did not attempt to tell the complete story of his life, but presented key episodes in a non-linear way, mainly his time in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] but including [[Burma]].{{sfn|Meyer|2017}} Foster reprised his role as Wingate in a 1982 TV movie ''A Woman Called Golda''.\n*A fictionalised version of Wingate called \"P.P. Malcolm\" appears in [[Leon Uris]]'s novel ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'', while he also appears in another [[Leon Uris]] novel, ''[[The Haj (novel)|The Haj]]''. Additionally, in [[James Michener]]'s ''[[The Source (novel)|The Source]]'', a reference is made to the \"Orde Wingate Forest\", which is located in Israel at Mount Gilboa.\n*\"Wingate and Chindits\" is an episode of the documentary TV series ''Narrow Escapes of World War II'' first presented in the United States on the [[Military Channel]] in 2012.\n*An episode of ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'' titled \"AMOK\" features a highly fictional take on Wingate's legacy in which his death was \"a bit of a charade&nbsp;... and a devilishly clever one at that\".  While exploring in Borneo, the Quest clan come across a mysterious valley and native village headed by Orde Wingate II, a fictionalized son of the true man.  It is explained that during the course of World War II, Wingate had come across the valley and befriended the people indigenous to it.  Finished with the war and knowing that the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] were close to winning in the Pacific, Wingate decided to lie low and live out the rest of his life peacefully in the valley, and so faked the plane crash leading to his apparent demise.  In order to protect the valley from intruders, he created the identity of the Amok, a savage [[sloth]]-like, [[Bigfoot]] creature based on an Indonesian guardian spirit.\n{{Portal|United Kingdom}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Alanbrooke |first=Field Marshal Viscount Alan Brooke |authorlink=Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke |editor=Alex Danchev and Daniel Todman |year=2001 |title=War Diaries 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Phoenix Press |isbn=1-84212-526-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |last=Allen |first=W.E.D. |authorlink=William Edward David Allen |date=9 April 1944 |url=http://www.jpress.org.il/Repository/getimage.dll?path=PLS/1944/04/09/4/Img/Pg004_122.png |title=Wingate of the Gideonites |newspaper=The Palestine Post |accessdate=10 January 2012 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Allen |first=Louis |year=1984 |title=Burma: The longest War |publisher=Dent Publishing |isbn=0-460-02474-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Allison |first=John (Maj.

Assigned to [[Mandatory Palestine]], he became a supporter of [[Zionism]], and set up a joint British-Jewish counter-insurgency unit. Under the patronage of the area commander [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], Wingate was given increasing latitude to put his ideas into practice during World War II. He created units in [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and Burma.\n\nAt a time when Britain was in need of morale-boosting generalship, Wingate attracted [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]'s attention with a self-reliant aggressive philosophy of war, and was given resources to stage a large-scale operation. The last Chindit campaign may have determined the outcome of the [[Battle of Kohima]], although the offensive into India by the Japanese may have occurred because Wingate's first operation had demonstrated the possibility of moving through the jungle. In practice, both Japanese and British forces suffered severe supply problems and malnutrition.\n\nWingate was killed in an aircraft accident late in the war. The casualty rate the Chindits suffered, especially from disease, is a continuing controversy. Wingate believed that resistance to infection could be improved by inculcating a tough mental attitude, but medical officers considered his methods unsuited to a tropical environment.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nWingate, the eldest of three sons, was born on 26 February 1903 at [[Nainital|Naini Tal]] near [[Almora]] in Kumaon, India, into a military family (cousins of the [[Wingate baronets]]).<ref>Bodyguard of Lies, Anthony Cave Brown, Harper and Row, 1975, p. 8</ref><ref>Wingate Pasha: The Life of General Sir Francis Reginald Wingate 1861-1953, R.

For the first 12 years of his life, he socialised primarily with his siblings.<ref name=\"Rooney14\"/> The seven Wingate children received a Christian education that was typical for that period, and time was set aside each day for studying and memorising the Scriptures.<ref name=\"Rooney14\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, his family moved to [[Godalming]] where Wingate attended [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] as a day boy. He did not board at the school nor did he participate in the activities of a public school education. Instead, he was kept busy at home by his parents, who encouraged their children to tackle challenging projects which fostered independent thought, initiative, and self-reliance.<ref>{{harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=15}}</ref>\n\n==Early army career==\nAfter four years, Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was accepted at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]] at [[Woolwich]], the [[Royal Artillery]]'s officers' training school. For committing a minor offence against the rules, a first-year student would be subjected to a [[ragging]] ritual named \"running\". This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to [[Running the gauntlet|run a gauntlet]] of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water.\n\nWhen it came time for Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, he walked up to the senior student at the head of the gauntlet, stared at him and dared him to strike.  The senior refused. Wingate moved to the next senior and did the same; he too refused. In turn, each senior declined to strike; coming to the end of the line, Wingate walked to the cistern and dived straight into the icy-cold water.<ref name=\"Rooney17\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Wingate received his Royal Artillery [[commissioned officer|officer's commission]]{{sfn|Gazette|32858}} and was posted to the 5th Medium Brigade at [[Larkhill]] on [[Salisbury Plain]].<ref name=\"Rooney17\"/> During this period, he was able to exercise his great interest in horse riding, gaining a reputation for his skill (and great success) in point-to-point races and fox hunting, particularly for finding suitable places to cross rivers, which earned him the nickname \"Otter\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=18}}</ref> It was difficult for a 1920s army officer to live on his pay and Wingate, living life to the full, also gained a reputation as a late payer of his bills.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=19}}</ref>\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant on 29 August 1925.{{sfn|Gazette|33079}} In 1926, because of his prowess in riding, Wingate was posted to the [[Military School of Equitation]] where he excelled, much to the chagrin of the majority of the [[cavalry]] officers at the centre who found him insufferable; he frequently challenged the instructors as a demonstration of his rebellious nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=20}}</ref>\n\n==Sudan, 1928\u20131933==\nWingate's father's cousin, Sir [[Reginald Wingate]], a retired army general who had been governor-general of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] between 1899 and 1916 and high commissioner of Egypt from 1917 to 1919, had a considerable influence on Wingate's career.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|pp=20\u201321}}</ref> He gave him a positive interest in Middle East affairs and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. As a result, Wingate applied to take a course in Arabic at the [[School of Oriental Studies]] in London and passed out of the course, which lasted from October 1926 to March 1927, with a mark of 85/100.<ref name=\"Rooney21\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=21}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1927, with Cousin Rex's encouragement, Wingate obtained six months' leave in order to mount an expedition in the Sudan.

From [[Cairo]] he travelled to [[Khartoum]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=22}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1928, his application to transfer to the Sudan Defence Force came through and he was posted to the East Arab Corps, serving in the area of [[Roseires]] and [[Gallabat]] on the borders of [[Ethiopia]], where the SDF patrolled to catch [[slavery|slave]] traders and [[ivory]] [[poaching|poachers]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|pp=22\u201323}}</ref> He changed the method of regular patrolling to [[ambush]]es.\n\nIn March 1930, Wingate was given command of a company of 300 soldiers with the local rank of ''bimbashi'' ([[major (United Kingdom)|major]]).

[[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] guerrillas had at the time of his arrival begun a [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|campaign of attacks]] against both British mandate officials and [[Jews|Jewish]] communities.\n\nWingate became politically involved with a number of Zionist leaders, and became an ardent Zionist himself.<ref name=\"Masters161\">{{Harvnb |Masters|1979|p=161}}</ref>  He always returned to Kibbutz [[Ein Harod|En Harod]]\u2014because he felt familiar with the biblical judge [[Gideon]], who fought in this area, and used it himself as a military base. He formulated the idea of raising small assault units of British-led Jewish commandos armed with grenades and light infantry small arms to combat the Arab revolt. Wingate took his idea personally to Wavell, who was then the commander of British forces in Palestine.\n\nAfter Wavell gave his permission, Wingate convinced the Zionist [[Jewish Agency]] and the leadership of [[Haganah]], the Jewish armed group.  In June 1938, the new British commander, General [[Robert Haining|Haining]], gave his permission to create the [[Special Night Squads]], armed groups formed of British and Haganah volunteers. The Jewish Agency helped pay salaries and other costs of the Haganah personnel.\n\nWingate trained, commanded and accompanied them on their patrols. The units frequently ambushed Arab saboteurs who attacked oil [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s of the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]], raiding border villages the attackers had used as bases. In these raids, Wingate's men sometimes imposed severe [[collective punishment]]s on the villagers, which was criticised by Zionist leaders as well as Wingate's British superiors.\n\nWingate disliked Arabs, once shouting at Haganah fighters after a June 1938 attack on a village on the border between Mandatory Palestine and Lebanon, \"I think you are all totally ignorant in your Ramat Yochanan [the training base for the Haganah] since you do not even know the elementary use of bayonets when attacking dirty Arabs: how can you put your left foot in front?\"{{#tag:ref|The quote is part of Amatziya Cohen's recollection of Wingate's tutelage.{{sfn|Papp\u00e9|2006|p=16}}|group=lower-alpha}} But the brutal tactics proved effective in quelling the uprising, and Wingate was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] in 1938.\n\nHowever, his deepening direct political involvement with the Zionist cause and an incident where he spoke publicly in favour of the formation of a Jewish state during his leave in Britain, caused his superiors in Palestine to remove him from command. He was so deeply associated with political causes in Palestine that his superiors considered him compromised as an intelligence officer in the country. He was promoting his own agenda rather than that of the army or the government. In May 1939, he was transferred to Britain. Wingate became a hero of the [[Yishuv]] (the Jewish Community), and was loved by leaders such as [[Zvi Brenner]] and [[Moshe Dayan]], who had trained under him and who claimed that Wingate had \"taught us everything we know.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IC04DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT152&dq=crucible+dayan+wingate+we+know&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzlcPp6_LeAhWOEVAKHQXHD1YQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=crucible%20dayan%20wingate%20we%20know&f=false Crucible], Jonathan Fenby</ref> Wingate's political attitudes toward Zionism were heavily influenced by his [[Plymouth Brethren]] religious views and belief in certain [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] doctrines.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Ethiopia and Gideon Force==\n[[File:Orde Wingate Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|Orde Wingate enters Addis Ababa on horseback.]]\nWingate was the commander of an anti-aircraft unit in Britain when [[World War II]] began. He repeatedly made proposals to the army and government for the creation of a Jewish army in Palestine which would rule over the area and its Arab population in the name of the British. His friend Wavell was commander-in-chief of [[Middle East Command]] based in [[Cairo]], and he invited him to Sudan to begin operations against Italian occupation forces in Ethiopia. He created [[Gideon Force]] under [[William Platt]], the British commander in Sudan, a [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) force composed of British, Sudanese, and Ethiopian soldiers.  At Khartoum, he and Tony Simonds joined Mission 101 controlled by London and Cairo.  \n[[File:Haile Selassie, Emperor of Abyssinia, with Brigadier Daniel Arthur Sandford (left) and Colonel Wingate (right) in Dambacha Fort, after it had been captured, 15 April 1941.

The Italians occupied Ethiopia between 1936 and 1941, and they conducted operations to \"pacify\" the people which killed about seven percent of the population.{{sfn|Sullivan|1999|p=188}} There was a huge reservoir of hatred for the Italians as a result, and many Ethiopians were happy to assist Gideon Force. Wingate was temporarily promoted lieutenant colonel and put in command. He again insisted on leading from the front and accompanied his troops in the reconquest of Abyssinia.\n\nGideon Force harassed Italian forts and their supply lines with the aid of local resistance fighters, while regular army units took on the main Italian army. A small force of no more than 1,700 men took the surrender of about 20,000 Italians toward the end of the campaign. At the end of the fighting, Wingate and the men of Gideon Force linked with the force of Lt. Gen. [[Alan Cunningham]] which had advanced from Kenya in the south, and they accompanied the emperor in his triumphant return to [[Addis Ababa]] that May. Wingate was mentioned in dispatches in April 1941 and was awarded a second DSO in December.\n\nWith the end of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] on 4 June 1941, Wingate was removed from command of the dismantled Gideon Force and his rank reduced to that of major. During the campaign, he was irritated that British authorities ignored a request for decorations for his men. They also obstructed his efforts to obtain back pay and other compensation. He left for Cairo and wrote an official report which was extremely critical of his commanders, fellow officers, government officials, and many others. He was also angry that his efforts had not been praised by authorities and that he had been forced to leave Abyssinia without saying farewell to Emperor Selassie. He was most concerned about British attempts to stifle Ethiopian freedom, writing that attempts to raise future rebellions amongst populations must be honest ones and should appeal to justice.\n\nWingate contracted [[malaria]] soon after this and sought treatment from a local doctor instead of army medical staff because he was afraid that the illness would give his detractors a further excuse to undermine him. This doctor gave him a large supply of the drug [[Atabrine]], which can produce [[Clinical depression|depression]] as a side-effect if taken in high dosages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=73}}</ref> Wingate was already depressed by the official response to his Abyssinian command, and he was also sick with malaria; he attempted suicide by stabbing himself in the neck.<ref name=\"Masters161\"/> Only prompt action by another officer saved him,{{sfn|Rooney|1999|pp=190\u2013191}} and he was sent to Britain to recuperate.\n\nA highly edited version of his report was passed to [[Winston Churchill]] through his political supporters in London, and Secretary of State for India [[Leo Amery]] contacted Wavell, Commander-in-Chief in India commanding the [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian Theatre]] to enquire if there were any chance of employing Wingate in the Far East. Wingate was far from pleased with his posting as a \"supernumary major without staff grading\", but he left Britain for [[Rangoon]] on 27 February 1942.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=75}}</ref>\n\n==Burma==\n===Chindits and the first long-range jungle penetration mission===\n[[File:The British Army in Burma in 1943 IND2237.jpg|thumb|right|Wingate after his return from operations in Japanese-occupied Burma in 1943]]\nWingate was appointed colonel once more by General Wavell upon arrival in the [[Far East]] in March 1942, and he was ordered to organise guerrilla units to fight behind Japanese lines. However, the precipitate collapse of Allied defences in Burma forestalled further planning, and he flew back to India in April where he began to promote his ideas for jungle [[long-range penetration]] units.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=76}}</ref> \"Never ask favours\", he recalled from his long association with Wavell, \"but tell people if they care to help they can come along, that you yourself are going anyway\".<ref>Wingate quoted in J.

Foot, ''SOE'' (1984), p. 9 {{full citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=Both citation, or [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]}}</ref>\n\nWavell was intrigued by Wingate's theories and gave him the (Indian 77th Infantry Brigade), from which he created a jungle long-range penetration unit. 77 Brigade was eventually named the [[Chindits]], a corrupted version of a mythical Burmese lion called the ''[[chinthe]]''.  By August 1942, he had set up a training centre at [[Dhana]] near Saugor district in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and attempted to toughen up the men by having them camp in the Indian jungle during the rainy season.  This proved disastrous, as the result was a very high sickness rate among the men. In one battalion, 70 percent of the men went absent from duty due to illness, while a [[Gurkha]] battalion was reduced from 750 men to 500.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=77}}</ref> Many of the men were replaced in September 1942 by new drafts of personnel from elsewhere in the army.\n\nMeanwhile, he won few friends among the officer corps with his direct manner of dealing with fellow officers and superiors, along with eccentric personal habits. He would eat raw onions because he thought that they were healthy, scrub himself with a rubber brush instead of bathing, and greet visitors to his tent while completely naked.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=164}}</ref> Wavell's political connections and patronage protected him from closer scrutiny, for he admired Wingate's work in the Abyssinian campaign, but Wingate remained the regimental gadfly always ready to flout the King's regulations; he grew a beard in the jungle and allowed his men to do the same. Nevertheless, he won plaudits by his outstanding courage and leadership in the face of the enemy.<ref>T.Holt, The Deceivers, vol.

Wingate then persuaded Wavell to let him proceed into Burma anyway, arguing the need to disrupt any Japanese attack on [[Sumprabum]] as well as to gauge the utility of long-range jungle penetration operations, and Wavell eventually gave his consent to ''Operation Longcloth''.<ref name=\"Rooney81\">{{Harvnb |Rooney|2000|p=81}}</ref> Wingate set out from [[Imphal]] on 12 February 1943 with the Chindits organised into eight separate columns to cross the [[Chindwin river]].<ref name=\"Rooney81\"/> The force met with initial success in putting one of the main railways in Burma out of action, then Wingate led them deep into Burma and over the [[Irrawaddy River]]. However, they found conditions very different from what their intelligence had led them to expect. The area was dry and inhospitable and criss-crossed by motor roads which the Japanese were able to use to good effect, particularly by intercepting supply drops to the Chindits. They soon began to suffer severely from exhaustion and shortages of water and food.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=88}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March, Eastern Army HQ ordered Wingate to withdraw his units back to India. He and his senior commanders considered a number of options to achieve this, but all were threatened by the fact that the Japanese would be able to focus their attention on destroying the Chindit force, having no major army offensive in progress. They finally agreed to retrace their steps to the Irrawaddy, since the Japanese would not expect this, and then disperse to make attacks on the enemy as they returned to the Chindwin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rooney|2000|p=91}}</ref> By mid-March, the Japanese had three infantry divisions chasing the Chindits, who were eventually trapped inside the bend of the [[Shweli River]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Masters|1979|pp=134\u201335}}</ref> They were unable to cross the river intact and still reach British lines, so they split into small groups to evade enemy forces. The Japanese paid great attention to preventing air resupply of Chindit columns, as well as hindering their mobility by removing boats from the Irrawaddy, Chindwin, and Mu rivers and actively patrolling the river banks.<ref name=\"Rooney99\">{{Harvnb |Rooney|2000|p=99}}</ref> The force returned to India by various routes during the spring of 1943 in groups ranging from single individuals to whole columns: some directly, others via a roundabout route from China, and always harassed by the Japanese.<ref name=\"Masters135\">{{Harvnb |Masters|1979|p=135}}</ref> Casualties were high, and the force lost approximately one-third of its total strength.<ref name=\"Masters135\"/>\n\n===After-battle analysis===\nWith the losses incurred during the first long-range jungle penetration operation, many officers in the British and Indian army questioned the overall value of the Chindits. The campaign had the unintended effect of convincing the Japanese that certain sections of the Burma/India Frontier were not as impassable as they previously believed, thus altering their strategic plans. As one consequence, the overall Japanese Army commander in Burma, Gen. [[Masakazu Kawabe]], began planning a 1944 offensive into India to capture the Imphal Plain and Kohima, in order to better defend Burma from future Allied offensives.<ref name=\"Rooney99\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=155}}</ref>\n\nIn London, the Chindits and their exploits were viewed as a success after the long string of Allied disasters in the Far East theatre. [[Winston Churchill]], an ardent proponent of commando operations, was, in particular, complimentary toward the Chindits and their accomplishments. The Japanese subsequently admitted that the Chindits had disrupted their plans for the first half of 1943.<ref name=\"Rooney99\"/>\n\nAs a propaganda tool, the Chindit operation was used to prove to the army and those at home that the Japanese could be beaten and that British/Indian troops could successfully operate in the jungle against experienced Japanese forces. On his return, Wingate wrote an operations report in which he was again highly critical of the army and even some of his own officers and men.  He also promoted more unorthodox ideas such as the idea that British soldiers had become weak by having too easy access to doctors in civilian life.  The report was again passed through back channels by Wingate's political friends in London directly to Churchill.  The Prime Minister then invited Wingate to London for talks.\n\nSoon after Wingate arrived, Churchill decided to take him and his wife along to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]].{{#tag:ref|British [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[Alan Brooke]] was astonished at this decision. In his ''War Diaries'', Brooke wrote after his interview with Wingate in London on 4 August: \"I was very interested in meeting Wingate&nbsp;...  I considered that the results of his form of attacks were certainly worth backing within reason&nbsp;...  I provided him with all the contacts in England to obtain what he wanted, and told him that on my return from Canada I would go into the whole matter with him&nbsp;... [later] to my astonishment I was informed that Winston was taking Wingate and his wife with him to Canada! It could only be as a museum piece to impress the Americans! There was no other reason to justify this move. It was sheer loss of time for Wingate and the work he had to do in England\".<ref>{{Harvnb |Alanbrooke|2001|p=436 entry for 4 August 1943).}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} There, Wingate explained his ideas of deep penetration warfare to the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] meeting on 17 August.{{#tag:ref|Brooke wrote on 17 August: \"Quite a good meeting at which I produced Wingate who gave a first class talk of his ideas and of his views on the running of the Burma campaign\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Alanbrooke|2001|p=443.}}</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} Air power, radio, and recent developments in warfare would allow units to establish bases deep in enemy territory, breaching the outer defences, and extend the range of conventional forces. The leaders were impressed, and larger scale deep-penetration attacks were approved. By now, a war-substantive lieutenant-colonel and temporary brigadier, Wingate was promoted to the acting rank of major-general on 18 September 1943.{{sfn|Gazette|36194}}\n\n===Second long-range jungle penetration mission===\n[[File:Chindit leaders Burma 1944 IWM MH 7873.jpg|thumb|right|Wingate with Chindit leaders.]]\nAfter his meeting with Allied leaders, Wingate contracted [[typhoid]] by drinking water from a flower vase in a Cairo hotel while on his way back to India. Doctors were shocked as it was drummed into every serviceman that they should never use such a source as drinking water. His illness prevented him from taking a more active role in training of the new long-range jungle forces.\n\nWhile Wingate was still in Burma, Wavell had ordered the formation of 111 Brigade, known as the \"Leopards\", along the lines of the 77 Brigade. He selected Brigadier [[Joe Lentaigne]] as the new commander.<ref name=\"Masters135\"/> Wavell intended that the two brigades would operate with one engaged on operations while the other trained and prepared for the next operation. However, once back in India, Wingate was promoted to acting major general and was given six brigades. This involved breaking up the experienced [[70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|70th Division]], which other commanders felt could be better used as a standard \"line\" division.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1984|p=319}}</ref> At first, Wingate proposed to convert the entire front into one giant Chindit mission by breaking up the whole of the Fourteenth Army into Long-Range Penetration units, presumably in the expectation that the Japanese would follow them around the Burmese jungle in an effort to wipe them out.<ref name=\"Masters163\">{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=163}}</ref> This plan was hurriedly dropped after other commanders pointed out that the Japanese Army would simply advance and seize the air bases from which Chindit forces were supplied, requiring a defensive battle and substantial troops that the Indian Army would be unable to provide.<ref name=\"Masters163\"/>\n\nIn the end, a new long-range jungle penetration operation was planned, this time using all six of the brigades recently allocated to Wingate. The second long-range penetration mission was originally intended as a coordinated effort with a planned regular army offensive against northern Burma, but events on the ground resulted in cancellation of the army offensive, leaving the long-range penetration groups without a means of transporting all six brigades into Burma. Upon Wingate's return to India, he found that his mission had also been cancelled for lack of air transport. Wingate took the news bitterly, voicing disappointment to all who would listen, including Allied commanders such as Colonel [[Philip Cochran]] of the 1st Air Commando Group, which proved to be a blessing in disguise. Cochran told Wingate that cancelling the long-range mission was unnecessary; only a limited amount of aerial transport would be needed since, in addition to the light planes and [[C-47 Dakota]]s Wingate had counted on, Cochran explained that 1st Air Commando had 150 gliders to haul supplies: \"Wingate\u2019s dark eyes widened as Phil explained that the gliders could also move a sizable force of troops. The general immediately spread a map on the floor and planned how his Chindits, airlifted deep into the jungle, could fan out from there and fight the Japanese\".{{sfn|Allison|2011}}\n\nWith his new glider landing option, Wingate decided to proceed into Burma anyway. The character of the 1944 operations differed from those of 1943 in that they aimed to establish fortified bases in Burma out of which the Chindits would conduct offensive patrol and blocking operations. A similar strategy would be used by the French in Indochina years later at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]].\n\n===Operation Thursday===\nWingate planned that part of 77 Brigade would land by glider in Burma and prepare airstrips into which 111 Brigade and the remainder of 77 Brigade would be flown by [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] transport aircraft. Three landing sites, codenamed \"Piccadilly\", \"Broadway\" and \"Chowringhee\" were selected. On the evening of 5 March as Wingate, Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Slim]] (the commander of Fourteenth Army), Brigadier [[Michael Calvert]] (the commander of 77 Brigade) and Cochrane waited at an airfield in India for 77 Brigade to fly into \"Piccadilly\", an incident occurred which Wingate's critics later claimed to show his lack of firmness or balance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masters|1979|p=170}}</ref>\n\nWingate had forbidden continuous reconnaissance of the landing sites to avoid compromising the security of the operation, but Cochrane ordered a last-minute reconnaissance flight which showed \"Piccadilly\" to be completely obstructed with logs. By Slim's account, Wingate became highly emotional and insisted that the operation had been betrayed, and that the Japanese would have set up ambushes on the other two landing sites. He passed the responsibility for ordering the operation to proceed or to be cancelled to Slim.<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|p=257}}</ref>\n\nSlim ordered that the operation was to go ahead. Wingate then ordered that 77 Brigade would fly into \"Chowringhee\". Both Cochrane and Calvert objected, as \"Chowringhee\" was on the wrong side of the Irrawaddy and Cochrane's pilots were not familiar with the layout. Eventually, \"Broadway\" was selected instead. The landings were initially a failure, as many gliders crashed ''en route'' or on \"Broadway\", but Calvert's brigade soon made the landing ground fit to take aircraft, and sent the success signal. It was later found that the logs on \"Piccadilly\" had been laid there to dry by Burmese teak loggers.<ref>{{harvnb|Slim|1956|p=261}}</ref>\n\nOnce all the Chindit brigades (less one which remained in India) had marched or flown into Burma, they established base areas and drop zones behind Japanese lines. By fortunate timing, the Japanese launched an invasion of India around the same time. By forcing several [[pitched battle]]s along their line of march, the Chindit columns were able to disrupt the Japanese offensive, diverting troops from the battles in India.\n\nThe value of Wingate's Chindits has been disputed. Field Marshal [[William Slim]] argued that special forces in general had an overall negative effect on the prosecution of war by separating the best-trained and most committed troops from the main army.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=546\u2013549}}  However, Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]], a Chindit who went on to become one of \"world's leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency\",{{sfn|Times staff|1992}} wrote in his autobiography that \"Every time I look at the picture of General Slim and his Corps Commanders being knighted by Lord Wavell as Viceroy on the field of battle after Imphal, I see the ghost of Wingate present. He was unquestionably one of the great men of [the 20th] century\".{{sfn|Thompson|1989|p=76}}\n\nRegarding Operation Thursday, historian Raymond Callahan, author of ''Churchill and His Generals'' argues that \"Wingate\u2019s ideas were flawed in many respects. For one thing, the Imperial Japanese Army did not have Western-style supply lines to disrupt, and tended to ignore logistics generally. When Special Force launched itself into Burma in March 1944, Wingate\u2019s ideas, so enchantingly laid out for Churchill, rapidly proved unworkable.\"<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/841-the-strange-case-of-the-prime-minister-and-the-fighting-prophetRaymond Callahan, \"The Strange Case of the Prime Minister and the Fighting Prophet\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219051715/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/841-the-strange-case-of-the-prime-minister-and-the-fighting-prophetRaymond |date=19 February 2014 }}</ref> However, the Japanese commander, [[Mutaguchi Renya]], later stated that Operation Thursday had a significant effect on the campaign, saying \"The Chindit invasion&nbsp;... had a decisive effect on these operations&nbsp;... they drew off the whole of 53 Division and parts of 15 Division, one regiment of which would have turned the scales at Kohima\".{{sfn|Anglim|2009|p={{page needed|date=May 2017}} }}\n\n==Death in India==\nOn 24 March 1944, Wingate flew to assess the situations in three Chindit-held bases in Burma.

The bodies were charred beyond recognition, hence individuals could not be identified under medical practices of the day, as identification from dental records was not possible.\n\nSince seven of the ten crash victims, including both pilots, were Americans, all ten bodies were exhumed in 1947 and reburied in Imphal, India and yet again exhumed in 1950 and flown to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Virginia]] for reburial. The exhumation was possible due to a three-way agreement among the governments of India, United Kingdom and the United States, and in accordance with the families' wishes.\n\n==Eccentricities==\nWingate was known for various [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]]ities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw onions and [[garlic]] on a string around his neck, which he would occasionally bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him come out of the shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Sometimes Wingate would eat only [[grape]]s and onions.<ref>Caufield, Catherine. (1981). ''The Emperor of the United States of America and Other Magnificent British Eccentrics''. Routledge & Kegan Paul. p. 213. {{ISBN|978-0710009579}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], Winston Churchill's personal physician, wrote in his diaries that \"[Wingate] seemed to me hardly sane \u2014 in medical jargon a borderline case.\"{{sfn|Wilson| 1966|p=115}} Likewise, referring to Churchill's meeting with Wingate in [[Quebec]], [[Max Hastings]] wrote that, \"Wingate proved a short-lived proteg\u00e9: closer acquaintance caused Churchill to realise that he was too mad for high command.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2009|p=388}}\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[File:Orde Wingate Square, Jerusalem.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Orde Wingate Square in Jerusalem's [[Talbiya]] neighbourhood.]]\nIn a tribute to Wingate, Churchill called him \"one of the most brilliant and courageous figures of the second world war&nbsp;... a man of genius who might well have become also a man of destiny\".{{sfn|ST staff|1951|p=3}}\n\nA [[Chindit Memorial|memorial to Orde Wingate and the Chindits]] stands on the north side of the [[Victoria Embankment]], near [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] headquarters in London. The facade commemorates the Chindits and the four men awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. The battalions that took part are listed on the sides, with non-infantry units mentioned by their parent formations. The rear of the monument is dedicated to Orde Wingate, and also mentions his contributions to the state of Israel.<ref>[http://www.chindits.info/Memorial/Main.html Chindit Memorial, London]</ref>\n\nTo commemorate Wingate's great assistance to the Zionist cause, Israel's National Centre for Physical Education and Sport, the [[Wingate Institute]] (''Machon Wingate'') was named after him. A square in the [[Talbiya]] neighbourhood of [[Jerusalem]], Wingate Square (''Kikar Wingate''), also bears his name, as does the [[Yemin Orde]] [[youth village]] near [[Haifa]].{{sfn|Owens|2004}} A [[Jew]]ish football club formed in London in 1946, [[Wingate Football Club]] was also named in his honour.\n\nThe General Wingate School, on the western city limit of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, commemorates Orde Wingate's contribution (along with the Gideon Force and the Ethiopian Patriots) to the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, following the defeat of the Italian forces in that country.{{sfn|''General Wingate School''|1955}}\n\nA memorial stone in his honour stands in [[Charlton Cemetery]], London, where other members of the Orde Browne family are buried. There is a memorial in Charterhouse School Chapel.\n\n[[File:The New Charterhouse School Chapel DSC 2161.jpg|thumb|The New Charterhouse School Chapel DSC 2161]]\n\n==Historiography==\nWingate's eccentric and strong-willed personality, his reputation for being difficult, advocacy of irregular warfare and his Zionism have led to sharply opposed assessments by historians.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|pp=1\u20132}} The British historian Simon Anglim called Wingate the most controversial British general of World War II as no other British general from that war produced such starkly polarized interpretations.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|pp=1\u20132}} The Chindit operations have been presented as either costly operations that achieved nothing or inspired operations that tied down Japanese troops that could have been used in the invasion of India.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|p=2}} In Britain, the two opposing tendencies has been for historians to portray him either as a mentally unstable, delusional figure operating well beyond his level of competence as in works by I.S.O. Playfair and Woodburn Kirby or alternatively as a visionary, a leader of men noted for his audacity, courage and toughness as in works by Charles Rolo, Bernard Fergusson, Wilfred Burchett, and Leonard Mosley.<ref name=\"Orlen\">{{harvnb|Orlen|2001}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to achieve a balance between the opposing views of Wingate were ''Orde Wingate and the Historians'' by Peter Mead, ''Wingate and the Chindits'' by David Rooney and ''Orde Wingate'' by Christopher Sykes.<ref name=\"Orlen\"/> In Ethiopia, Wingate is remembered as liberator from the Italian occupation. In Israel, Wingate's role with creating and leading the SNS, which become the prototype of the Israeli Defense Forces has made him a national hero, a man celebrated for his Zionism and courage, in the words of the Israeli historian [[Michael Oren]] a \"heroic, larger-than-life figure to whom the Jewish people owed a deep and enduring debt\".<ref name=\"Orlen\"/>\n\nThe two most popular Israeli books about Wingate, both written by SNS veterans were ''In the Path of Fighters'' by Israel Carmi and ''Orde Wingate: His Life and Works'' by Avraham Akavia.<ref name=\"Orlen\"/> By contrast, Palestinian historians portrayed Wingate very negatively as a thuggish fanatic who terrorized Palestinian villages during the Arab Revolt.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|p=2}}\n\nIn recent years, the Israeli [[New Historians]] have taken a critical picture of Wingate with [[Tom Segev]] calling him \"quite mad, and perhaps a sadist, too\u201d and a war criminal.<ref name=\"Orlen\"/> Oren has accused Segev of maligning Wingate, arguing that Segev has \"edited\" accounts by contemporaries to imply that Wingate was present at incidents in Palestine when he was in London at the time.{{sfn|Anglim|2015|pp=91\u201392}}\n\n==Family==\nOrde Wingate had a wife, Lorna, and a son, Lt Col Orde Jonathan Wingate, who joined the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] after a regular Army career in the Royal Artillery and became the regiment's commanding officer and later regimental colonel. He died in 2000 at the age of 56,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1372902/Lt-Col-Orde-Wingate.html|title=Lt-Col Orde Wingate|date=2000-11-03|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and was survived by his wife and two daughters.\n\nHe was also related to [[Reginald Wingate]] and [[Ronald Wingate]]. The [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], Sir [[William Dobbie]], was his uncle.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In 1976, the [[BBC]] produced a three-part drama called ''Orde Wingate'', based on his life, in which he was played by [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]. The programme was made on a limited budget with reduced or stylized settings. It did not attempt to tell the complete story of his life, but presented key episodes in a non-linear way, mainly his time in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] but including [[Burma]].{{sfn|Meyer|2017}} Foster reprised his role as Wingate in a 1982 TV movie ''A Woman Called Golda''.\n*A fictionalised version of Wingate called \"P.P. Malcolm\" appears in [[Leon Uris]]'s novel ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'', while he also appears in another [[Leon Uris]] novel, ''[[The Haj (novel)|The Haj]]''. Additionally, in [[James Michener]]'s ''[[The Source (novel)|The Source]]'', a reference is made to the \"Orde Wingate Forest\", which is located in Israel at Mount Gilboa.\n*\"Wingate and Chindits\" is an episode of the documentary TV series ''Narrow Escapes of World War II'' first presented in the United States on the [[Military Channel]] in 2012.\n*An episode of ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'' titled \"AMOK\" features a highly fictional take on Wingate's legacy in which his death was \"a bit of a charade&nbsp;... and a devilishly clever one at that\".  While exploring in Borneo, the Quest clan come across a mysterious valley and native village headed by Orde Wingate II, a fictionalized son of the true man.  It is explained that during the course of World War II, Wingate had come across the valley and befriended the people indigenous to it.  Finished with the war and knowing that the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] were close to winning in the Pacific, Wingate decided to lie low and live out the rest of his life peacefully in the valley, and so faked the plane crash leading to his apparent demise.  In order to protect the valley from intruders, he created the identity of the Amok, a savage [[sloth]]-like, [[Bigfoot]] creature based on an Indonesian guardian spirit.\n{{Portal|United Kingdom}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Alanbrooke |first=Field Marshal Viscount Alan Brooke |authorlink=Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke |editor=Alex Danchev and Daniel Todman |year=2001 |title=War Diaries 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Phoenix Press |isbn=1-84212-526-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |last=Allen |first=W.E.D. |authorlink=William Edward David Allen |date=9 April 1944 |url=http://www.jpress.org.il/Repository/getimage.dll?path=PLS/1944/04/09/4/Img/Pg004_122.png |title=Wingate of the Gideonites |newspaper=The Palestine Post |accessdate=10 January 2012 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Allen |first=Louis |year=1984 |title=Burma: The longest War |publisher=Dent Publishing |isbn=0-460-02474-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |last=Allison |first=John (Maj.
