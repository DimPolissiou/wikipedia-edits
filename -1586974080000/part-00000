Pereira as [[principal (school)|Principal]]. The number of pupils was 17 girls and 33 boys, which has now grown to 1,450 students.\n\n==History==\nThe school building was inaugurated and blessed by Valerian [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Gracias on 31 May 1960. Some of the [[Daughters of Mary]] Help of [[Christians]], Auxilium Convent, with Rev [[Sister Superior]], Bertha, attended the function held in the evening. There was a speech by the Cardinal followed by a few items of [[song]] and [[dance]] performed by the parishioners. The parish priest, [[Reverend|Rev]]. Fr Theophilus Lobo, due to whose labours the building owed its existence, gave the concluding speech.\n\nThe school started as a [[co-educational]] school, initially with Stds I-III and students, mostly [[parish]] children. With a view to establishing a [[convent school]] at Bandra, the superiors had appointed two sisters from Auxilium Convent, Sr Zita and Sr Regina, to teach in the parish school at [[Pali Hill]].\n\nThe new school opened its first [[academic year]] on 13 June 1960 with classes, Std. I, II, III (and lower and upper [[kindergartens]] which began functioning later). Half-day classes were held till the end of June, as the building was yet incomplete.\n\nInitially St Anne's High School was run as day school but when admissions increased greatly, the school was run in shifts.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of St. Anne's High School, every year new classes were added till the first batch of four SSC students appeared for the SSC Board Examination in 1966. The school secured cent percent results that year.\n\nIn Fr Trevor's initiatives included vocational guidance and [[counselling]], the Scouts and Guides, and other extra curricular activities like [[field sports]], [[elocution]], [[dramatics]], [[music]] and competitions, [[excursions]] and [[Summer camp|camp]]s.

Funds for the construction were collected by way of [[cultural]] programmes, fetes and raffles organised by the parish and the school. Msgr Malcolm Mendonca served until his transfer in 1982.\nMsgr Zachary D'souza took over as manager while Ms Greta Alvares continued as [[Headmistress]]. The school participated in inter-school competitions for [[elocution]], [[science]] projects, teaching-aids [[exhibitions]] and [[sports]] events.\n\nThe school was made a center for S.S.C Maharashtra State Board Examinations.

The first SSC batch was in 1966 and they achieved a 100 per cent result. This was followed by 100 per cent in 1967 and 1968 too\nHowever St Anne's had to wait for a long time to achieve the same success that they had achieved in 1966 to 1968 the wait took them 35 years until 2003 when St Anne's again achieved a cent per cent result. The school achieved a cent per cent result the following year in 2004. The same success the school achieved in 2014, after the ten years of waiting.\n\n==School holidays==\nThe school remains closed on most Bank Holidays and on St. Anne's Feast Day which is on 26 July where there is a function organised by the school for the children.

Scheubner-Richter was leader of the [[Aufbau Vereinigung]] and a leading [[ideologist]] of the [[National Socialist]] movement at the beginning of the [[Interwar period]]. Scheubner-Richter became a key influence and close associate of [[Adolf Hitler]] and activist of the Nazi Party instrumental in securing financing for the early party.\n\nScheubner-Richter was killed during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923 and part of Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was dedicated to him. Scheubner-Richter was elevated to status of ''[[Blutzeuge]]'' and national hero upon the founding of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933.\n\n==Early life==\nLudwig Maximilian Erwin Richter was born on 21 January 1884 in [[Riga]], [[Russian Empire]], the son of a [[German Empire|German]] musician and a [[Baltic German]] mother. Richter lived a large part of his early life in the [[Governorate of Livonia]], and studied chemistry at the [[Riga Polytechnical Institute]] from 1904 to 1906. Richter joined a pro-government [[private army]] during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]] and married Mathilde von Scheubner, the daughter of the owner of a factory he was tasked with protecting. Mathilde was 19 years his senior and a [[noblewoman]]. After the conclusion of the revolution in 1907, Richter moved to the German city of [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]], where he continued his studies and became a ''[[Doktoringenieur]]''. In 1912, Scheubner was prefixed to his own name upon adoption by one of his wife's relatives, an old German form of having one's lineage ennobled. \n\n==World War I and Armenian Genocide==\nOn 10 August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Scheubner-Richter joined the [[Imperial German Army]] as a [[Military volunteer|volunteer]] and was assigned to the 7th Bavarian Chevauleger Regiment Straubing on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. However, Scheubner-Richter was relocated to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] from November 1914, where Germany was fighting the [[Imperial Russian Army]], after one of his superiors discovered his knowledge of the [[Russian language|Russian]] language.\n\nScheubner-Richter later served in [[Ottoman Turkey]] as the German [[Vice Consul|vice consul]] of [[Erzerum]] &ndash; this appointment was a disguise for a secret operation by the Germans to [[sabotage]] the Russian oil fields in the [[Caucasus]], under the belief it would cause the Russian war effort to grind to a halt. The Germans hoped to infiltrate during an Ottoman offensive on Russian fortifications in [[Kars]], but the operation was cancelled when the Ottomans were not as successful as expected. Russian resistance made infiltration of the Caucasus impossible, and Scheubner-Richter remained working as a consul in Turkey for the remainder of the war.

The Aufbau Vereinigung under Scheubner-Richter's leadership has been considered one of the major early influences of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP or Nazi Party), of which Scheubner-Richter and Rosenberg became prominent members. Scheubner-Richter met Hitler in October 1920, soon becoming his foreign policy adviser and a financier identifying other sources of income for the party. \n\nScheubner-Richter formally joined the NSDAP in 1921 and generally seen as one of the most important patrons of the early party. Scheubner-Richter was particularly noteworthy for his extensive contacts with [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[right-wing]] circles in Germany, including the famous World War I general [[Erich Ludendorff]]. Scheubner-Richter used his financial and political ties to court the support of the German elite, including [[industrialist]]s, high [[ecclesiastical]] posts, [[aristocrats]] such as the [[Prussian Junker]]s and the [[Wittelsbachs]], and wealthy Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Scheubner-Richter appealed to exiled Russian [[monarchist]]s across Europe, who hoped through support from the NSDAP, to influence German policy in the direction of eliminating the Soviet Union and re-establishing the [[Tsar of All Russia|Tsar]] in Russia. These efforts generated considerable financial resources for the NSDAP.\n\nAt the end of September 1923, Scheubner-Richter provided Adolf Hitler with a lengthy plan for revolution, writing: \"The national revolution must not precede the seizure of political power; the seizure of the state's police power constitutes the promise for the national revolution\" and \"to lay hands on the state police power in a way that is at least outwardly legal\".<ref>Heiden, Konrad. ''Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1944, p. 184.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nScheubner-Richter was a participant in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], marching on the ''[[Feldherrnhalle]]'' in Munich along with two thousand NSDAP members. On 9 November 1923, Scheubner-Richter, walking arm-in-arm with Hitler, was shot in the lungs and died instantly as he and others marched toward armed guards during the Putsch.<ref>[[John Toland (author)|Toland, John]].

''[[The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response]]''. New York, [[HarperCollins]], 2003, p. 407, {{ISBN|0-06-055870-9}}.</ref> The first part of Hitler's book, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', is dedicated to Scheubner-Richter and the other fifteen men who died in the Putsch. The Aufbau Vereinigung declined rapidly after Scheubner-Richter's death, and its increasing integration with the NSDAP saw most of its Russian membership abandon the organization over the growing notions of [[anti-Slavism]] and ''[[Lebensraum]]''.\n\nIn 1933, the establishment of [[Nazi Germany]] led to Scheubner-Richter being venerated as a national hero. Scheubner-Richter was one of the most prominent ''[[Blutzeuge]]'' (\"blood witness\"), a term for Nazis killed before the NSDAP's rise to power and were [[martyr]]s of the Nazi movement. Scheubner-Richter's name was featured on a panel attached to the ''Feldherrnhalle'' with the names of the Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch. The panel was guarded by an [[honor guard]] of the [[SS]], and every passer-by was expected to perform the [[Hitler salute]]. Numerous streets in towns across Germany were renamed after Scheubner-Richter. In 1935, the [[Ehrentempel]] was erected at [[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]] in Munich to house to the [[sarcophagi]] of Scheubner-Richter and the other ''Blutzeuge'' that died in the Beer Hall Putsch.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Witnesses and testimonies of the Armenian Genocide]]\n*[[Dietrich Eckart]]\n*''[[Alter K\u00e4mpfer]]''\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071110005851/http://genocide1915.info/research/view.asp?ID=10 Report On Armenian Genocide by Eye Witness, Scheubner-Richter, German Consule/Administrator in Erzerum].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scheubner-Richter, Max}}\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1923 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Riga]]\n[[Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia]]\n[[Category:Baltic-German people]]\n[[Category:Nazi leaders]]\n[[Category:Witnesses of the Armenian Genocide]]\n[[Category:Nazis who participated in the Beer Hall Putsch]]\n[[Category:20th-century Freikorps personnel]]\n[[Category:Kapp Putsch participants]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Germany]]\n[[Category:Russian anti-communists]]\n[[Category:German anti-communists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|honorific_prefix = \n|name             = Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter\n|honorific_suffix = \n|image            = Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1930-01, Max Erwin v.

These efforts generated considerable financial resources for the NSDAP.\n\nAt the end of September 1923, Scheubner-Richter provided Adolf Hitler with a lengthy plan for revolution, writing: \"The national revolution must not precede the seizure of political power; the seizure of the state's police power constitutes the promise for the national revolution\" and \"to lay hands on the state police power in a way that is at least outwardly legal\".<ref>Heiden, Konrad. ''Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1944, p. 184.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nScheubner-Richter was a participatant in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], marching on the ''[[Feldherrnhalle]]'' in Munich along with two thousand NSDAP members. On 9 November 1923, Scheubner-Richter, walking arm-in-arm with Hitler, was shot in the lungs and died instantly as he and others marched toward armed guards during the Putsch.<ref>[[John Toland (author)|Toland, John]]. ''Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography''. New York: Anchor Books, 1976, p. 170, {{ISBN|0-385-42053-6}}.</ref> Hitler was brought down and his right shoulder was [[Dislocation|dislocated]] as Scheubner-Richter's body fell after being shot dead. \n\nScheubner-Richter was the only \"first-tier\" Nazi leader to die during the Beer Hall Putsch, and of all the early party members who died in the Putsch, Hitler claimed Scheubner-Richter to be the only \"irreplaceable loss\".<ref>[[Peter Balakian|Balakian, Peter]]. ''[[The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response]]''. New York, [[HarperCollins]], 2003, p. 407, {{ISBN|0-06-055870-9}}.</ref> The first part of Hitler's book, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', is dedicated to Scheubner-Richter and the other fifteen men who died in the Putsch. The Aufbau Vereinigung declined rapidly after Scheubner-Richter's death, and its increasing integration with the NSDAP saw most of its Russian membership abandon the organization over the growing notions of [[anti-Slavism]] and ''[[Lebensraum]]''.\n\nIn 1933, the establishment of [[Nazi Germany]] led to Scheubner-Richter being venerated as a national hero. Scheubner-Richter was one of the most prominent ''[[Blutzeuge]]'' (\"blood witness\"), a term for Nazis killed before the NSDAP's rise to power and were [[martyr]]s of the Nazi movement. Scheubner-Richter's name was featured on a panel attached to the ''Feldherrnhalle'' with the names of the Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch. The panel was guarded by an [[honor guard]] of the [[SS]], and every passer-by was expected to perform the [[Hitler salute]]. Numerous streets in towns across Germany were renamed after Scheubner-Richter. In 1935, the [[Ehrentempel]] was erected at [[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]] in Munich to house to the [[sarcophagi]] of Scheubner-Richter and the other ''Blutzeuge'' that died in the Beer Hall Putsch.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Witnesses and testimonies of the Armenian Genocide]]\n*[[Dietrich Eckart]]\n*''[[Alter K\u00e4mpfer]]''\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071110005851/http://genocide1915.info/research/view.asp?ID=10 Report On Armenian Genocide by Eye Witness, Scheubner-Richter, German Consule/Administrator in Erzerum].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scheubner-Richter, Max}}\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1923 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Riga]]\n[[Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia]]\n[[Category:Baltic-German people]]\n[[Category:Nazi leaders]]\n[[Category:Witnesses of the Armenian Genocide]]\n[[Category:Nazis who participated in the Beer Hall Putsch]]\n[[Category:20th-century Freikorps personnel]]\n[[Category:Kapp Putsch participants]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Germany]]\n[[Category:Russian anti-communists]]\n[[Category:German anti-communists]]\n", "name_user": "Yungmemelord", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDeath", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Erwin_von_Scheubner-Richter"}
