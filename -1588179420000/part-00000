Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 21st film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Nicole Perlman]], [[Meg LeFauve]], and [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Perlman and LeFauve were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranked as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]]. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is scheduled for release on July 8, 2022.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

She described the friendship between Danvers and Rambeau as equal, with \"a playful competitiveness [and a] mutual respect\".<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /> Like Larson, Lynch met with active duty airmen in preparation for the role. In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people. So he's almost a devout warrior\u2014unquestioning, conservative, but inspirational.\" Law also stated that his character has a special relationship with Danvers, whom he views as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, which becomes a source of tension in the film with the other members of Starforce. [[Robert Downey Jr.]], who portrays [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in the MCU films and who co-starred with Law in ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009) and [[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows|its sequel]] (2011), counseled him on working with Marvel before Law took the part.<ref name=\"EWLaw\" />\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n\nAdditional members of Starforce include [[Algenis P\u00e9rez Soto]] as [[Captain Atlas|Att-Lass]], the marksman of the team, and [[Rune Temte]] as [[Bron-Char]], the \"bigger, stronger guy who fights with his fists\".<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Maria's daughter, [[Monica Rambeau]], is played by Akira and Azari Akbar as an eleven-year-old and a five-year-old, respectively.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"AkiraMonica\" /> [[Sharon Blynn]] portrays Soren, Talos' wife.<ref name=\"Blynn\" /> [[Robert Kazinsky]] appears as a biker nicknamed \"The Don\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> [[Vik Sahay]] plays a Torfan,<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> while [[Chuku Modu]] portrays the Kree spy Soh-Larr.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> [[Colin Ford]] appears as Danvers' brother, Steve,<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> and [[Kenneth Mitchell (actor)|Kenneth Mitchell]] plays their father.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> Danvers' comic book cat [[Chewie (comics)|Chewie]] (named for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Chewbacca]]) appears in the film, renamed Goose for the ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986) character Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /><ref name=\"GooseTheCat\" /> Its name was changed since ''Star Wars'' is a contemporary franchise and not specific to Danvers, unlike the pilot-themed ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"GooseRename\" /> Goose is portrayed by four different cats, each chosen for their actions and personality: Reggie, Archie, Rizzo and Gonzo.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n\nReal life air force pilots Matthew \"Spider\" Kimmel and Stephen \"Cajun\" Del Bagno appear as themselves.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> Del Bagno died months prior to the film's release,<ref name=\"DelBagnoDeath\" /> and it is dedicated to his memory.<ref name=\"Dedicated\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' comic book writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] makes a cameo appearance as a train station passerby,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> and [[Stan Lee]], co-creator of Captain Marvel, appears posthumously as himself memorizing the lines for his cameo in ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"StanLee\" /> Reprising their MCU roles for the mid-credits scene are [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]], and [[Don Cheadle]] as [[War Machine|James Rhodes / War Machine]].<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n{{quote box|width = 33%|quote=We've been talking a lot about ... how to write a strong female superhero without making it [[Superman]] with boobs. ...

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, Marvel revealed that [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> Marvel also announced that [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] had been cast,<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> and revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had all contributed to the film's screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously was a member of Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited rewrites during production.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others. Berman spoke fondly of this large team, feeling that they gave her the opportunity to focus on the film's story rather than the technical aspects of editing.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" />\n\n[[File:Young Nick.jpg|thumb|upright|Jackson in ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (top) and in ''Captain Marvel'' (bottom). ''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\"/> VFX supervisor Chris Townsend stated that they also looked at [[anime]] for inspiration, but said any resemblance between the fiery look of the Binary powers and [[Goku]]'s Super Saiyan form in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' was not intentional. Townsend said that the primary inspiration for the Binary powers was science, including [[Tesla coil]]s and [[photon energy]].<ref name=\"DBZInspiration\"/>\n\nILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framestore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

Scott]] of ''The New York Times'' said the film was \"not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\" /> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Owen Gleiberman]] also praised the film's direction. He said that Boden and Fleck had not been able to retain their signature style of \"low-key American neorealis[m]\", but was still positive about how the were able to create a film with \"enough tricks and moods and sleight-of-hand layers to keep us honestly absorbed\" within the house style of the MCU.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and said it was a \"real treat\" to follow the origin stories of both Carol Danvers and Nick Fury.<ref name=\"ChicagoSunTimesReview\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] gave it four stars and praised Larson's performance for bringing \"layers of feeling to a role that a lesser actress might have let slide by on pyrotechnics. You see how she lays the foundation for a character who defies male objectification and becomes akin to what [[Joni Mitchell]] called 'a woman of heart and mind.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> Anthony Lane of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' stated, \"Superhero cinema has lectured us, ad infinitum, on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson, for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun.\"<ref name=\"NewYorkerReview\" />\n\n[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described the film as \"mundane, marked by unimaginative plotting, cut-rate villains, a bland visual style and a lack of elan in every department\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> David Ehrlich at ''[[IndieWire]]'' gave the film a 'C\u2013' grade and called it \"neither a blast from the past, nor an inspiring glimpse into the future ... it's just another Marvel movie.

Ehrlich praised Mendelsohn saying he gave the best performance in the film.<ref name=\"IndieReview\" /> Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said Danvers \"is a candidate for genuine heroism\" but found a \"fundamental dissonance between the depth of her plight and the shallow disorganization of the script\".<ref name=\"WSJReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] was disappointed by the film, finding it to be \"everything you might expect a sci-fi superhero movie to be, if you hadn't seen one in a long time\".<ref name=\"AVClubReview\" /> Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' compared the film to a political commercial that \"packs a worthy message [but] hardly counts as an aesthetic experience.

Rotten Tomatoes later said a bug was responsible for the high count of reviews, and by 1:00 P.M. the number of counted ratings was down to 7,000 with an audience score of 35%.<ref name=\"ReviewBomb3\" /> {{As of|2020|03|20|df=US}}, the audience score was at 48% based on just over 94,620 ratings.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" />\n\nAudiences of the film polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave it an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 84% overall positive score and a 73% \"definite recommend\". 58% said it met their expectations while 35% said it exceeded them. Unlike ''Wonder Woman'', which was watched by more women than men, ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s initial audience was 61% male according to PostTrak. Discussing these statistics, ''Deadline Hollywood''{{'}}s Anthony D'Alessandro praised CinemaScore and PostTrak for taking scientific polls that actually identified how the audience was feeling about the film, and criticized the Rotten Tomatoes audience score as an \"ancient 1990s means of collecting opinions online\" that is influenced by \"ugly Internet troll noise\".<ref name=\"DHThursday\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[MTV Movie & TV Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[2019 MTV Movie & TV Awards|June 17, 2019]]\n| [[MTV Movie Award for Best Hero|Best Hero]]\n| [[Brie Larson]]\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"MTVAwards\" />\n|-\n| [[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight|Best Fight]]\n| [[Brie Larson]] vs. [[Gemma Chan]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Teen Choice Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[2019 Teen Choice Awards|August 11, 2019]]\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie \u2013 Action|Choice Action Movie]]\n| ''Captain Marvel''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|<ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| Choice Action Movie Actress\n| [[Brie Larson]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Choice Action Movie Actor\n| [[Samuel L.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience. If we can pull it off it could be an incredibly important but also really fun and kick-ass superhero film.--> }} Transcription of interview: {{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-origins-green-lantern/|title=Captain Marvel's Origins Being Changed to Avoid Green Lantern Comparisons|last=Anhalt|first=Bobby|website=Screen Rant|date=August 11, 2016|access-date=August 11, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6jgavvHkP?url=http://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-origins-green-lantern/|archive-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/why-hiring-a-female-director-for-captain-marvel-is-important-to-kevin-feige|title=Why Hiring A Female Director For Captain Marvel Is Important To Kevin Feige|last=Schwartz|first=Terri|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 12, 2016|access-date=October 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013144704/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/why-hiring-a-female-director-for-captain-marvel-is-important-to-kevin-feige|archive-date=October 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/captain-marvel-movie-director-kevin-feige.html|title=Kevin Feige Says Brie Larson's Captain Marvel Will Be the Strongest Superhero Yet|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|date=October 21, 2016|access-date=October 21, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6lQmmdje8?url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/captain-marvel-movie-director-kevin-feige.html|archive-date=October 21, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FeigeNov2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/marvel-kevin-feige-interview-spider-man-captain-marvel-diversity-1201923851/|title=Marvel's Kevin Feige on 'Spider-Man's' Future and Why Brie Larson Was Perfect for 'Captain Marvel'|last=Lang|first=Brent|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=November 22, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mDPYUYce?url=http://variety.com/2016/film/news/marvel-kevin-feige-interview-spider-man-captain-marvel-diversity-1201923851/|archive-date=November 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\">{{Cite tweet|last=Kroll|first=Justin|user=krolljvar|number=809179958266380288|title=Captain Marvel Update: Studio getting treatment on script soon.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 21st film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Nicole Perlman]], [[Meg LeFauve]], and [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Perlman and LeFauve were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranked as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]]. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is scheduled for release on July 8, 2022.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L.

It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''.

She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015).

Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, Marvel revealed that [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> Marvel also announced that [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] had been cast,<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> and revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had all contributed to the film's screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously was a member of Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited rewrites during production.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others. Berman spoke fondly of this large team, feeling that they gave her the opportunity to focus on the film's story rather than the technical aspects of editing.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" />\n\n[[File:Young Nick.jpg|thumb|upright|Jackson in ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (top) and in ''Captain Marvel'' (bottom). ''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\"/> VFX supervisor Chris Townsend stated that they also looked at [[anime]] for inspiration, but said any resemblance between the fiery look of the Binary powers and [[Goku]]'s Super Saiyan form in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' was not intentional. Townsend said that the primary inspiration for the Binary powers was science, including [[Tesla coils]] and [[photon energy]].<ref name=\"DBZInspiration\"/>\n\nILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framestore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings. The plane debuted at the [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]] before its first flight to [[Orange County, California]].<ref name=\"Airport\" /> At the end of the month, an hour-long video of Goose was livestreamed on Marvel's [[YouTube]] channel.<ref name=\"Goose\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n[[File:Holloman F-16 pilot attends Captain Marvel premiere.jpg|thumb|[[Lashana Lynch]] with airmen of the [[311th Fighter Squadron]] at the Hollywood premiere of ''Captain Marvel'']]\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019,<ref name=\"LondonPremiere\" /> and in Hollywood on March 4.<ref name=\"cmpremiere\" /> The Hollywood premiere included a [[Flypast|flyover]] by the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]] in honor of Thunderbirds pilot [[Major (United States)|Major]] Stephen Del Bagno,<ref name=\"PremiereFlyOver\" /> who consulted with Larson on the film before dying in a training accident in April 2018.<ref name=\"DelBagnoConsultant\" /> The film was released in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]],<ref name=\"IMAXRelease\" /><ref name=\"3DRelease\" /> in the United States on March 8,<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" /> coinciding with [[International Women's Day]].<ref name=\"IWD\" /> It was originally scheduled for release on July 6, 2018,<ref name=\"MarvelOct2014\" /> but in February 2015 it was moved to November 2, 2018 to make room for ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"Feb2015Dates\" /> and in October 2015 it was pushed to its final March 2019 date for ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Oct2015Dates\" /> The film's release in Pakistan was delayed for four weeks.<ref name=\"PakistanRelease2\" /> At the time, Disney's South Asia division, which is headquartered in India, had not given Pakistan the rights to distribute it.

The message of the film is conveyed less through the story than through its casting.\"<ref name=\"NewYorkerReview2\" />\n\n=== Audience response ===\nIn late December 2018, the film was named as the most anticipated 2019 film by [[IMDb]], the most anticipated new standalone comic book film and the second-most anticipated blockbuster of 2019 according to the ticketing service Fandango,<ref name=\"IMDbFandangoAnticipation\" /> and the second-most anticipated superhero and overall film by Atom Tickets.<ref name=\"AtomTicketsAnticipation\" />\n\nAhead of the film's release, ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s \"Want to See\" score\u2014an audience anticipation poll on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014had fallen to 28%.<ref name=\"ReviewBomb2\" /> Reports described the decline as an effort by some to [[review bomb]] the film's page with negative comments attacking the film and Larson for their perceived [[feminism]].<ref name=\"ReviewBomb1\" /> Rotten Tomatoes changed the \"Want to See\" feature shortly after, showing only the number of people indicating interest in the film instead of a percentage. The announcement said this was part of a larger redesign of the site, and that the \"Want to See\" feature would be restored once the film was released.<ref name=\"ReviewBomb2\" /><ref name=\"Rotten change\" /> By 8:00 A.M. on opening day in the United States, the film held a 33% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes from more than 58,000 reviews, which was more audience reviews than ''Avengers: Infinity War'' had during its entire theatrical run. Analysts attributed the low score and sheer number of reviews to [[Internet troll|online trolling]]. Rotten Tomatoes later said a bug was responsible for the high count of reviews, and by 1:00 P.M. the number of counted ratings was down to 7,000 with an audience score of 35%.<ref name=\"ReviewBomb3\" /> {{As of|2020|03|20|df=US}}, the audience score was at 48% based on just over 94,620 ratings.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" />\n\nAudiences of the film polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave it an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 84% overall positive score and a 73% \"definite recommend\". 58% said it met their expectations while 35% said it exceeded them. Unlike ''Wonder Woman'', which was watched by more women than men, ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s initial audience was 61% male according to PostTrak. Discussing these statistics, ''Deadline Hollywood''{{'}}s Anthony D'Alessandro praised CinemaScore and PostTrak for taking scientific polls that actually identified how the audience was feeling about the film, and criticized the Rotten Tomatoes audience score as an \"ancient 1990s means of collecting opinions online\" that is influenced by \"ugly Internet troll noise\".<ref name=\"DHThursday\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[MTV Movie & TV Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[2019 MTV Movie & TV Awards|June 17, 2019]]\n| [[MTV Movie Award for Best Hero|Best Hero]]\n| [[Brie Larson]]\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"MTVAwards\" />\n|-\n| [[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight|Best Fight]]\n| [[Brie Larson]] vs. [[Gemma Chan]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Teen Choice Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[2019 Teen Choice Awards|August 11, 2019]]\n| [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie \u2013 Action|Choice Action Movie]]\n| ''Captain Marvel''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|<ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| Choice Action Movie Actress\n| [[Brie Larson]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Choice Action Movie Actor\n| [[Samuel L.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience. If we can pull it off it could be an incredibly important but also really fun and kick-ass superhero film.--> }} Transcription of interview: {{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-origins-green-lantern/|title=Captain Marvel's Origins Being Changed to Avoid Green Lantern Comparisons|last=Anhalt|first=Bobby|website=Screen Rant|date=August 11, 2016|access-date=August 11, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6jgavvHkP?url=http://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-origins-green-lantern/|archive-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/why-hiring-a-female-director-for-captain-marvel-is-important-to-kevin-feige|title=Why Hiring A Female Director For Captain Marvel Is Important To Kevin Feige|last=Schwartz|first=Terri|website=[[IGN]]|date=October 12, 2016|access-date=October 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013144704/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/why-hiring-a-female-director-for-captain-marvel-is-important-to-kevin-feige|archive-date=October 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/captain-marvel-movie-director-kevin-feige.html|title=Kevin Feige Says Brie Larson's Captain Marvel Will Be the Strongest Superhero Yet|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|date=October 21, 2016|access-date=October 21, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6lQmmdje8?url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/captain-marvel-movie-director-kevin-feige.html|archive-date=October 21, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FeigeNov2016\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/marvel-kevin-feige-interview-spider-man-captain-marvel-diversity-1201923851/|title=Marvel's Kevin Feige on 'Spider-Man's' Future and Why Brie Larson Was Perfect for 'Captain Marvel'|last=Lang|first=Brent|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=November 22, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6mDPYUYce?url=http://variety.com/2016/film/news/marvel-kevin-feige-interview-spider-man-captain-marvel-diversity-1201923851/|archive-date=November 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\">{{Cite tweet|last=Kroll|first=Justin|user=krolljvar|number=809179958266380288|title=Captain Marvel Update: Studio getting treatment on script soon.

{"title_page": "Pang Chai-sip", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=April 2016}}\n\n'''Pang Chai-sip''' ({{lang|zh|\u5f6d\u6fdf\u6d89}}; 1914\u20132005) was a renowned Hong Kong artist of the [[Lingnan school]] ([[:zh:\u5dba\u5357\u756b\u6d3e|\u5dba\u5357\u756b\u6d3e]]) of [[Chinese painting]]. Born in Guangdong, Pang started his life in art as a student at the Art Institute of Guangzhou (\u5ee3\u5dde\u5e02\u7acb\u7f8e\u8853\u5b78\u9662), by which he learnt his painting skills and philosophy with virtuosos in the field like [[Li Yanshan]], [[Li Jinfa]] ([[:zh:\u674e\u91d1\u9aee|\u674e\u91d1\u9aee]]), [[Chao Shao-an]], [[Huang Junbi]] ([[:zh:\u9ec3\u541b\u74a7|\u9ec3\u541b\u74a7]]) and [[Li Xiongcai]] ([[:zh:\u9ece\u96c4\u624d|\u9ece\u96c4\u624d]]).\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Pang fled from warfare and settled in Hong Kong. In 1958, Lingnan-style painters including Li Yanshan, Chao Shao-an, and Pang founded the Hong Kong Chinese Art Club (\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u570b\u7f8e\u8853\u6703) with the view to promote Chinese arts in Hong Kong.\n\nPang worked as illustrator for Great Wall Movie Enterprise Limited (\u9577\u57ce\u96fb\u5f71\u88fd\u7247\u516c\u53f8), where he contributed his illustrations to a few dozen Hong Kong movies, including ''The Awful Truth'' (1950) and ''A Bachelor is Born'' (1952).\n\nIn his late years, Pang founded the Chai-Sip Art Studio (\u6fdf\u6d89\u756b\u9662), where he offered painting classes to the public and trained talented young painters. At the same time, took charge of Chinese painting programs for [[Fung Kai Secondary School]] ([[:zh:\u4e0a\u6c34\u9cf3\u6eaa\u4e2d\u5b78|\u9cf3\u6eaa\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b78]]) in Sheung Shui. He had hundreds of students, and talented Chinese painters have developed their skills under his tutelage.\n\nPang painted for over half a century beginning with his apprenticeship in the Art Institute of Guangzhou, and his paintings have reached the public through numerous exhibitions, stretching his wings to Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:\u300c\u6fdf\u6d89\u756b\u9662\u300d\u820a\u8c8c\uff0c\u5f6d\u6fdf\u6d89\u5148\u751f\u4f5c\u756b\u6642\u62cd\u4e0b.png|thumb|Chai-Sip Art Studio]]\n\nPang started his career as an artist in the Art Institute of Guangzhou. Li Jinfa, the principal of the institute, aimed to develop the institute and influence the art scene in China at that time. With the help of the legendary Lingnan style master [[Gao Jianfu]], Chao Shao-an accepted the invitation to join the institute and be the head of the Faculty of Chinese Painting . Following Chao were iconic  Lingnan style painters like [[Su Wonong]] (\u8607\u81e5\u8fb2), [[Ye Yongqing]] (\u696d\u6c38\u9752), and [[Li Xiongcai]], who turned to be instructors of the faculty. With these instructors, the Art Institute of Guangzhou turned to be the cradle of talented Lingnan style Chinese painters.\n\nAmong talented students, Pang has been a name that was mentioned around instructors for his skills and talent. He spent his apprenticeship flourishing his painting skills with the virtuosos, and often he visited Master Gao Jianfu to learn about the precious tips of drawing iconic creatures in Chinese paintings, i.e. birds, fish, insects and flowers. Chao, who favoured and later became good friends with Pang, had often offered his calligraphy as a present for Pang\u2019s exhibitions.\n\nDuring the WWII, the Art Institute of Guangzhou was forced to vacate and cease operations due to warfare. Instructors and students like Li Yanshan, Chao Shao-an, Pang and many others fled and settled in Hong Kong. To carry on the spirit of the Art Institute, Li, Chao, and Pang founded the Hong Kong Chinese Art Club (\u9999\u6e2f\u4e2d\u570b\u7f8e\u8853\u6703), and Pang became a member of the club's executive committee.\n\nWhile life of an artist was not ascertained in Hong Kong, Pang has struggled for survival with his family during his early days in Hong Kong. He has hidden his ambition in art and painting, joined Great Wall Movie Enterprise Limited (\u9577\u57ce\u96fb\u5f71\u88fd\u7247\u516c\u53f8) and became an illustrator for Hong Kong movies. His illustrations appeared in dozens of Hong Kong movies, including ''The Awful Truth'' (\u8aaa\u8b0a\u4e16\u754c, 1950), A Bachelor is Born (\u65b9\u5e3d\u5b50, 1952), and others.\n\nA few years later, Pang left the movie industry and started his career as a teacher. While being a teacher in Kowloon Tong School (\u4e5d\u9f8d\u5858\u5b78\u6821) and [[Fanling Public School]], Pang picked his ambition and dream up again and spent most of his spare time in painting, travelling to natural scenery and launching Chinese painting classes to teach the talented. In late years, Pang started the Chai-Sip Art Studio (\u6fdf\u6d89\u756b\u9662), which was his platform to flourish his paintings, to teach gifted youngsters painting techniques and the public about the appreciation of Chinese paintings.\n\nPang's low-profile and simple character maybe a hinder to his fame in the Chinese painting scene; yet there is no doubt about his passion to Chinese painting. For more than 50 years, he has never stopped painting, ending with a rich collection of paintings, more than a few hundreds, now treasured with good care by his family. The style of his painting evolved with time, never followed tides of trends; they could be seen as pure expressions of his creativity in painting perspectives and formations, his passion to the nature and his love to the simple countryside lifestyle.\n\nPang's paintings have travelled to different continentals throughout the years, in which hundreds and thousands of visitors and collectors have seen his work of art in his exhibitions in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn November 2014, Pang\u2019s family and the Hong Kong Chinese Art Club jointly organized an exhibition in memory of Mr. Pang Chai Sip, which involved paintings of Pang back in 1937, and scrolls of precious early works of Pang. Hundreds of visitors came and joined the phenomenal 3-days event to express their love and appreciation of the devoted artist.\n\n==Appreciations from the art scene==\n\nChao wrote a poem commemorating Pang\u2019s painting \u2013 \"With his paint we see the marvels of the nature, with his strokes we feel the emotions behind the bushes; with his brushes we are startled with the beauty of the mysterious haze, with Pang the world is just his painting.\" (\u300c\u842c\u6c34\u5343\u5c71\u9020\u5316\u5de5\uff0c\u5e7e\u682a\u758f\u67f3\u5165\u7a7a\u6fdb\uff0c\u70df\u96f2\u51fa\u6c92\u591a\u8b8a\u5e7b\uff0c\u90fd\u5728\u5f6d\u541b\u7b46\u58a8\u4e2d\u3002\u300d) This showed Chao's appreciation for Pang's perspectives and skills and the atmosphere created through his painting.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

While being a teacher in Kowloon Tong School (\u4e5d\u9f8d\u5858\u5b78\u6821) and [[Fanling Public School]], Pang picked his ambition and dream up again and spent most of his spare time in painting, travelling to natural scenery and launching Chinese painting classes to teach the talented. In late years, Pang started the Chai-Sip Art Studio (\u6fdf\u6d89\u756b\u9662), which was his platform to flourish his paintings, to teach gifted youngsters painting techniques and the public about the appreciation of Chinese paintings.\n\nPang's low-profile and simple character maybe a hinder to his fame in the Chinese painting scene; yet there is no doubt about his passion to Chinese painting. For more than 50 years, he has never stopped painting, ending with a rich collection of paintings, more than a few hundreds, now treasured with good care by his family. The style of his painting evolved with time, never followed tides of trends; they could be seen as pure expressions of his creativity in painting perspectives and formations, his passion to the nature and his love to the simple countryside lifestyle.\n\nPang's paintings have travelled to different continentals throughout the years, in which hundreds and thousands of visitors and collectors have seen his work of art in his exhibitions in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn November 2014, Pang\u2019s family and the Hong Kong Chinese Art Club jointly organized an exhibition in memory of Mr. Pang Chai Sip, which involved paintings of Pang back in 1937, and scrolls of precious early works of Pang. Hundreds of visitors came and joined the phenomenal 3-days event to express their love and appreciation of the devoted artist.\n\n==Appreciations from the art scene==\n\nChao wrote a poem commemorating Pang\u2019s painting \u2013 \"With his paint we see the marvels of the nature, with his strokes we feel the emotions behind the bushes; with his brushes we are startled with the beauty of the mysterious haze, with Pang the world is just his painting.\" (\u300c\u842c\u6c34\u5343\u5c71\u9020\u5316\u5de5\uff0c\u5e7e\u682a\u758f\u67f3\u5165\u7a7a\u6fdb\uff0c\u70df\u96f2\u51fa\u6c92\u591a\u8b8a\u5e7b\uff0c\u90fd\u5728\u5f6d\u541b\u7b46\u58a8\u4e2d\u3002\u300d) This showed Chao's appreciation for Pang's perspectives and skills and the atmosphere created through his painting.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

Wiesbaden 1965</ref> There are about 2,000 Latvian and 200 German loanwords in Livonian and most of the German words were adopted through Latvian.<ref>Gyula D\u00e9csy: ''Einf\u00fchrung in die finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft'', page 82. Wiesbaden 1965</ref> Latvian, however, was influenced by Livonian as well. Its regular syllable stress based on Livonian is very unusual in a Baltic language.  Especially as of the end of the nineteenth century there was a great deal of contact with Estonians, namely between ([[Courland|Kurzeme]]) Livonian fishers or mariners and the Estonians from [[Saaremaa]] or other islands.  Many inhabitants of the islands of Western Estonia worked in the summer in Kurzeme Livonian villages.  As a result, a knowledge of Estonian spread among those Livonians and words of Estonian origin also came into Livonian.<ref>{{harv|Ariste|1981|loc=p. 79}}</ref> There are about 800 Estonian loanwords in Livonian, most of which were borrowed from the Saaremaa dialect.<ref>Gyula D\u00e9csy: ''Einf\u00fchrung in die finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft'', page 83.

Many inhabitants of the islands of Western Estonia worked in the summer in Kurzeme Livonian villages.  As a result, a knowledge of Estonian spread among those Livonians and words of Estonian origin also came into Livonian.<ref>{{harv|Ariste|1981|loc=p. 79}}</ref> There are about 800 Estonian loanwords in Livonian, most of which were borrowed from the Saaremaa dialect.<ref>Gyula D\u00e9csy: ''Einf\u00fchrung in die finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft'', page 83.

It is the only airport in the province of [[Misamis Occidental]]. The airport is classified as a community airport by the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]], a body of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. It is one of only two community airports in the Philippines with commercial operations, but one of the busiest in Mindanao in terms of flights and passenger traffics.\n\nThe airport takes its name from its location, the barangay of [[Labo, Ozamiz|Labo]] in Ozamiz.\n\nOzamiz-Labo Airport also serves the cities of [[Oroquieta]] and [[Tangub]], some municipalities of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Lanao del Norte]] and some parts of [[Lanao del Sur]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ozamizairport06-1956.jpg|left|thumbnail|Misamis Airfield(now Ozamiz Airport) with the persons involved in the airport. circa 1950's]]\nIt was known as Misamis Airfield during the Pre-[[World War II]] and Post-[[World War II]] until the municipality become a cityhood status in 1948 and was change of what is now Ozamiz Airport. [[Philippine Airlines]], the first airline to operate the airport, serves regular air service to this airport using the McDonnell Douglas DC-3 from Manila. In 80's-90's, [[Philippine Airlines]] was using their Fokker 50 and Sunriser planes to Manila and Cebu until the closure of the airport.\n\nThe airport was closed in 1998 after [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) stopped the operation of their smaller Fokker and Sunriser planes because its runway could not accommodate jetliners and wide-bodied aircraft. PAL was affected by financial crisis and labor disputes during that period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nOn July 11, 2007, Ozamiz Airport was re-opened<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&sec=reader&rp=1&fi=p070712.htm&no=7&date=07/12/2007|title=PIA daily news in English, Tagalog, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Waray, Pangalatok from around the Philippines|website=Archives.pia.gov.ph}}</ref> to the public with the former President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] and the Provincial and City Officials joined the ceremonial event.

With the entrance of [[Cebu Pacific Air]] in [[Ozamiz]], this would give to the passengers to be easily access and more choices to choose from Cebu. [[PAL Express]] became the competitor of [[Cebu Pacific Air]] to/from Cebu.\n\nOn June 16, 2009, after the expansion and widening of the runway and passed the runway jet requirement, the [[Airbus A319]] successfully smooth landed at the airport by [[Cebu Pacific Air]] in the morning<ref>[http://www.cebupacificair.com/pages/pressreleases.aspx?pid=533]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the comeback [[Philippine Airlines]] at noon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philippineairlines.com/news/jun11_pal_returns_to_ozamiz_june16.jsp|title=Oops!

Last Summer 2012, Ozamiz Airport officially known as an Airbus Airport since [[Cebu Pacific Air]] and [[Airphil Express]] are both using [[Airbus A319]] and [[Airbus A320]] to and from Manila and Cebu. That was also the time when [[Cebu Pacific Air]] added its 2nd flight to/from Manila in the late afternoon flight until July 2012.\n\nCurrently, Ozamiz-Labo Airport is serving Manila and Cebu routes using A320, A319, [[Q400]] and [[ATR 72-500]] by [[Philippine Airlines]] operated by [[PAL Express]] (former [[Airphil Express]]) and [[Cebu Pacific Air]] daily.\n\n== Rehabilitation and expansion ==\nExtension and expansion of the airport runway started in 2005 using congressional funds of [[Misamis Occidental]] District 2 Congresswoman Herminia Ramiro. It was reopened to commercial flights on July 8, 2007, with Air Philippines offering direct Ozamiz-Manila v.v. routes. The airport is expected to have a bigger budget from the national government in the coming months because of its strategic location, increasing volume of passengers and cargoes{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.\n\nExpansion and development of the airport particularly its runway, tarmac and passenger terminal building continued again in the 1st quarter of 2008. Come July 2009, implementation of the asphalt overlay will begin for the entire 1.9 kilometer runway, apron and taxiway. This includes the setting up of runway lights to accommodate night flight operations.\n\n[[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]](CAAP) announced that 14 provincial airports in the Philippines will have to install night capable landing so that the airplanes can land safely at night and to ease the congestion problem of [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]], the main airport in the Philippines.

It is the only airport in the province of [[Misamis Occidental]]. The airport is classified as a community airport by the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]], a body of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. It is one of only two community airports in the Philippines with commercial operations, but one of the busiest in Mindanao in terms of flights and passenger traffics.\n\nThe airport takes its name from its location, the barangay of [[Labo, Ozamiz|Labo]] in Ozamiz.\n\nOzamiz-Labo Airport also serves the cities of [[Oroquieta]] and [[Tangub]], some municipalities of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Lanao del Norte]] and some parts of [[Lanao del Sur]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ozamizairport06-1956.jpg|left|thumbnail|Misamis Airfield(now Ozamiz Airport) with the persons involved in the airport. circa 1950's]]\nIt was known as Misamis Airfield during the Pre-[[World War II]] and Post-[[World War II]] until the municipality become a cityhood status in 1948 and was change of what is now Ozamiz Airport. [[Philippine Airlines]], the first airline to operate the airport, serves regular air service to this airport using the McDonnell Douglas DC-3 from Manila. In 80's-90's, [[Philippine Airlines]] was using their Fokker 50 and Sunriser planes to Manila and Cebu until the closure of the airport.\n\nThe airport was closed in 1998 after [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL) stopped the operation of their smaller Fokker and Sunriser planes because its runway could not accommodate jetliners and wide-bodied aircraft. PAL was affected by financial crisis and labor disputes during that period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nOn July 11, 2007, Ozamiz Airport was re-opened<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&sec=reader&rp=1&fi=p070712.htm&no=7&date=07/12/2007|title=PIA daily news in English, Tagalog, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Waray, Pangalatok from around the Philippines|website=Archives.pia.gov.ph}}</ref> to the public with the former President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] and the Provincial and City Officials joined the ceremonial event.

With the entrance of [[Cebu Pacific Air]] in [[Ozamiz]], this would give to the passengers to be easily access and more choices to choose from Cebu. [[PAL Express]] became the competitor of [[Cebu Pacific Air]] to/from Cebu.\n\nOn June 16, 2009, after the expansion and widening of the runway and passed the runway jet requirement, the [[Airbus A319]] successfully smooth landed at the airport by [[Cebu Pacific Air]] in the morning<ref>[http://www.cebupacificair.com/pages/pressreleases.aspx?pid=533]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the comeback [[Philippine Airlines]] at noon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philippineairlines.com/news/jun11_pal_returns_to_ozamiz_june16.jsp|title=Oops!

Last Summer 2012, Ozamiz Airport officially known as an Airbus Airport since [[Cebu Pacific Air]] and [[Airphil Express]] are both using [[Airbus A319]] and [[Airbus A320]] to and from Manila and Cebu. That was also the time when [[Cebu Pacific Air]] added its 2nd flight to/from Manila in the late afternoon flight until July 2012.\n\nCurrently, Ozamiz-Labo Airport is serving Manila and Cebu routes using A320, A319, [[Q400]] and [[ATR 72-500]] by [[Philippine Airlines]] operated by [[PAL Express]] (former [[Airphil Express]]) and [[Cebu Pacific Air]] daily.\n\n== Rehabilitation and expansion ==\nExtension and expansion of the airport runway started in 2005 using congressional funds of [[Misamis Occidental]] District 2 Congresswoman Herminia Ramiro. It was reopened to commercial flights on July 8, 2007, with Air Philippines offering direct Ozamiz-Manila v.v. routes. The airport is expected to have a bigger budget from the national government in the coming months because of its strategic location, increasing volume of passengers and cargoes{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.\n\nExpansion and development of the airport particularly its runway, tarmac and passenger terminal building continued again in the 1st quarter of 2008. Come July 2009, implementation of the asphalt overlay will begin for the entire 1.9 kilometer runway, apron and taxiway. This includes the setting up of runway lights to accommodate night flight operations.\n\n[[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]](CAAP) announced that 14 provincial airports in the Philippines will have to install night capable landing so that the airplanes can land safely at night and to ease the congestion problem of [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]], the main airport in the Philippines.

The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it's \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nFive years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nHowever, in 1962 Anthony Bonner published a fresh, essentially complete translation of Verne's masterwork for [[Bantam Classics]]. This edition also included a special introduction written by sci-fi author [[Ray Bradbury]] and comparing Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nA significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans).

Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nMercier's errors were further corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources along with a new translation, again by Walter James Miller but in collaboration with fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter. The volume was published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] and subtitled \"The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3238-0}}.\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. Disney's filmscript elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to acquire Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film. Also, Nemo's submarine confines her activities to a defined, circular section of the Pacific Ocean, unlike the movements of the original ''Nautilus''. \n\nFinally, Nemo is again depicted as East Indian in the Soviet 3-episode TV film ''[[Captain Nemo (film)|Captain Nemo]]'' (1975), which also includes some plot details from ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* {{annotated link|French corvette Alecton}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea|''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers''}}\n{{Commons category|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n*[http://jv.gilead.org.il/fpwalter ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''], trans. by F.

Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it's \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nFive years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nHowever, in 1962 Anthony Bonner published a fresh, essentially complete translation of Verne's masterwork for [[Bantam Classics]]. This edition also included a special introduction written by sci-fi author [[Ray Bradbury]] and comparing Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nA significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nMercier's errors were further corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources along with a new translation, again by Walter James Miller but in collaboration with fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter. The volume was published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] and subtitled \"The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-4384-3238-0}}.\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. Disney's filmscript elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to acquire Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film. Also, Nemo's submarine confines her activities to a defined, circular section of the Pacific Ocean, unlike the movements of the original ''Nautilus''. \n\nFinally, Nemo is again depicted as East Indian in the Soviet 3-episode TV film ''[[Captain Nemo (film)|Captain Nemo]]'' (1975), which also includes some plot details from ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* {{annotated link|French corvette Alecton}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea|''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers''}}\n{{Commons category|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n*[http://jv.gilead.org.il/fpwalter ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''], trans. by F.

It took place between [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesia's declaration of independence]] in 1945 and the [[Netherlands]]' [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference|recognition of Indonesia's independence]] at the end of 1949.\n\nThe four-year struggle involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict, internal Indonesian political and communal upheavals, and two major international diplomatic interventions. Dutch military forces (and, for a while, the forces of the [[World War II Allies]]) were able to control the major towns, cities and industrial assets in Republican heartlands on [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] but could not control the countryside. By 1949, international pressure on the Netherlands and the partial military [[stalemate]] became such that it recognised Indonesian independence.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=35}}\n\nThe revolution marked the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial administration]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]], except for [[Netherlands New Guinea]]. It also significantly changed ethnic castes as well as reducing the power of many of the local rulers (''[[raja]]''). It did not significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the majority of the population, although a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Indonesian National Awakening|Japanese occupation of Indonesia}}\n\nThe Indonesian independence movement began in May 1908, which is commemorated as the \"[[Indonesian National Awakening|Day of National Awakening]]\" ({{lang-id|Hari Kebangkitan Nasional}}). Indonesian nationalism and movements supporting independence from Dutch colonialism, such as [[Budi Utomo]], the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI), [[Sarekat Islam]] and the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), grew rapidly in the first half of the 20th century. Budi Utomo, Sarekat Islam and others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated ''Volksraad'' (\"People's Council\") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule.{{sfn|Vandenbosch|1931|pp=1051\u2013106}} Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony.{{sfn|Kahin|1980|pp=113\u2013120}} The most notable of these leaders were [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]], two students and nationalist leaders who had benefited from the educational reforms of the [[Dutch Ethical Policy and Indonesian National Revival|Dutch Ethical Policy]].\n\nThe [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupation of Indonesia by Japan]] for three and a half years during World War II was a crucial factor in the subsequent revolution. The Netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]], and within only three months of their initial attacks, the Japanese had occupied the Dutch East Indies. In Java, and to a lesser extent in Sumatra (Indonesia's two dominant islands), the Japanese spread and encouraged nationalist sentiment. Although this was done more for Japanese political advantage than from altruistic support of Indonesian independence, this support created new Indonesian institutions (including local neighbourhood organisations) and elevated political leaders such as Sukarno. Just as significantly for the subsequent revolution, the Japanese destroyed and replaced much of the Dutch-created economic, administrative, and political infrastructure.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=85}}\n\nOn 7 September 1944, with the war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister [[Kuniaki Koiso|Koiso]] promised independence for Indonesia, but no date was set.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=207}} For supporters of Sukarno, this announcement was seen as vindication for his collaboration with the Japanese.{{sfn|Frederick & Worden|1993}}\n\n==Independence declared==\nUnder pressure from radical and politicised ''pemuda'' ('youth') groups, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], on 17 August 1945, two days after the Japanese Emperor's [[Victory over Japan Day|surrender in the Pacific]]. The following day, the [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] (KNIP) elected Sukarno as [[President of Indonesia|President]], and Hatta as [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice-President]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=213}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=325}}{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=30}}\n\n{{quote|\n| style = text-align:left; width:30%;padding:10px 15px; border-style:solid; border-width:1px;min-width: 20em\n| text = PROCLAMATION\n\nWe, the people of Indonesia, hereby declare the independence of Indonesia.\n\nMatters which concern the transfer of power etc. will be executed by careful means and in the shortest possible time.\n\nDjakarta, 17 August 1945<ref>Note: In fact, 05 was used for the year meaning [[Japanese imperial year]] 2605.</ref>\n\nIn the name of the people of Indonesia,\n\n[signed] Soekarno\u2014Hatta\n\n<small>(Translation by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], October 1948)</small>{{sfn|Kahin|2000|pp=1\u20134}}\n}}\n\n===Revolution and Bersiap===\n{{See also|Bersiap}}\n\n[[File:Indonesian flag raised 17 August 1945.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Bendera Pusaka]]'', the first Indonesian flag, is raised on 17 August 1945.]]\nIt was mid-September before news of the declaration of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital [[Jakarta]] did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=214\u2013215}}  External power had shifted; it would be weeks before [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] shipping entered Indonesia (owing in part to [[Black Armada|boycotts and strikes, in Australia]], on coaling, loading and manning Dutch shipping from Australia where the Netherlands East Indies Government in exile was based). These strikes were only fully broken in July 1946.{{sfn|Lockwood|1975}} The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|Crib|1996|pp=72\u201385}}\n\nThe resulting power vacuums in the weeks following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}} Many ''pemuda'' joined pro-Republic struggle groups (''badan perjuangan''). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded ''Giyugun'' ([[PETA (Indonesia)|PETA]], volunteer army) and ''Heiho'' (local soldiers employed by Japanese armed forces) groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\nBy September 1945, control of major infrastructure installations, including railway stations and trams in Java's largest cities, had been taken over by Republican ''pemuda'' who encountered little Japanese resistance.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=215\u2013216}} To spread the revolutionary message, ''pemuda'' set up their own radio stations and newspapers, and graffiti proclaimed the nationalist sentiment. On most islands, struggle committees and [[militia]] were set up.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=198}} Republican newspapers and journals were common in Jakarta, [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], and [[Surakarta]], which fostered a generation of writers known as ''angkatan 45'' ('generation of 45') many of whom believed their work could be part of the revolution.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\nRepublican leaders struggled to come to terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist [[Tan Malaka]], spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian ''pemuda''. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=97}} Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.\n\nBy September 1945, many of the self-proclaimed ''pemuda'', who were ready to die for '100% freedom', were getting impatient. It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' \u2013 Dutch internees, [[Indo people|Eurasian]], [[Ambon Island|Ambonese]] and [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] \u2013 and anyone considered to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnap, robbery, murder and organised massacres. Such attacks would continue throughout the course of the revolution, but were most present during the 1945\u201346 period, which is known as the [[Bersiap]].{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=49}}{{sfn|Fenton-Huie|1992|p=}}{{sfn|Reid|1981|pp=107\u2013157}}\n\nAfter the Bersiap in 1947 Dutch authorities attempted to retrieve the bodies of the victims and several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the Attorney General office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of ''Bersiap'' victims can be found in the ''Kembang Kuning'' war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere.\n\nThe ''Simpang Society Club Surabaya'' was appropriated by the Pemudas of the ''Partai Rakyat Indonesia'' (P.R.I.) and made into the headquarters of P.R.I. commander [[Sutomo]], who personally supervised the summary executions of hundreds of civilians. An archived eyewitness testimony of the events of 22 October 1945 states:\n\n<blockquote>Before each execution Sutomo mockingly asked the crowd what should be done with this \"Musuh (enemy) of the people\". The crowd yelled \"Bunuh!\" (kill!) after which the executioner named Rustam decapitated the victim with one stroke of his sword. The victim was then left to the bloodthirst of boys 10, 11 and 12 years old. ...[who] further mutilated the body.\" \"Women were tied to the tree in the back yard and pierced through the genitals with \"[[bambu runcing]]\" (bamboo spears) until they died.</blockquote>\n\nOn Sutomo's orders the decapitated bodies were disposed of in the sea, the women were thrown in the river.<ref>Note: These legal testimonies formerly designated ''top secret'' have been made public and are available online.

It adopted [[Constitution of Indonesia|a constitution]] drafted during the Japanese occupation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence. With general elections yet to be held, a [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] (KNIP) was appointed to assist the President. Similar committees were established at provincial and regency levels.\n\nQuestions of allegiance immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. [[Central Java]]nese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many ''raja'' ('rulers') of the outer islands, who had been enriched from their support of the Dutch, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from [[South Sulawesi]] (including the King of [[Bone state|Bone]], who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in the century), and from [[Makassarese]] and [[Bugis]] ''raja'', who supported the Republican Governor of Jakarta, a [[Menado]]nese Christian. Many [[Bali]]nese ''raja'' accepted Republican authority.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=214}}\n\nFearing the Dutch would attempt to re-establish their authority over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely in contact with the outer islands,{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=33}} which had more Japanese troops (particularly in [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese naval]] areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=215}} In November 1945, a [[parliamentary|parliamentary form of government]] was established and [[Sutan Sjahrir|Sjahrir]] was appointed Prime Minister.\n\nIn the week following the Japanese surrender, the Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese.<ref>Most PETA and Heiho members did not yet know about the declaration of independence.</ref> Command structures and membership vital for a national army were consequently dismantled.

Lord Mountbatten's immediate tasks included the repatriation of some 300,000 Japanese, and freeing prisoners of war. He did not want, nor did he have the resources, to commit his troops to a long struggle to regain Indonesia for the Dutch.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=99}} The first British troops reached Jakarta in late September 1945, and arrived in the cities of [[Medan]] ([[North Sumatra]]), [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] ([[West Sumatra]]), [[Palembang]] ([[South Sumatra]]), [[Semarang]] ([[Central Java]]) and [[Surabaya]] ([[East Java]]) in October. In an attempt to avoid clashes with Indonesians, the British commander Lieutenant General Sir [[Philip Christison]] diverted soldiers of the former Dutch colonial army to eastern Indonesia, where Dutch reoccupation was proceeding smoothly.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}} Tensions mounted as Allied troops entered Java and Sumatra; clashes broke out between Republicans and their perceived enemies, namely Dutch prisoners, [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Dutch colonial troops (KNIL)]], Chinese, [[Indo (Eurasian)|Indo-Europeans]] and Japanese.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}}\n\nThe first stages of warfare were initiated in October 1945 when, in accordance with the terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they had relinquished to Indonesians in the towns and cities. Japanese military police killed Republican ''pemuda'' in [[Pekalongan]] (Central Java) on 3 October, and Japanese troops drove Republican ''pemuda'' out of [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] and handed the city to the British, but the fiercest fighting involving the Japanese was in Semarang. On 14 October, British forces began to occupy the city. Retreating Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners they were holding. Five hundred Japanese and two thousand Indonesians had been killed and the Japanese had almost captured the city six days later when British forces arrived.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}} The Allies repatriated the remaining Japanese troops and civilians to Japan, although about 1,000 elected to remain behind and later assisted Republican forces in fighting for independence.{{sfn|Tjandraningsih|2011|p=3}}\n[[File:Een sectie militairen tijdens een rustpauze, Bestanddeelnr 15857.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch soldiers in the East Indies, 1946]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Vernielingen in de Chinese wijk TMnr 10014680.jpg|thumb|Destruction in Bandung's Chinese quarter]]\nThe British subsequently decided to evacuate the 10,000 Indo-Europeans and European internees in the volatile Central Java interior. British detachments sent to the towns of [[Ambarawa]] and [[Magelang]] encountered strong Republican resistance and used air attacks against the Indonesians.

Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November{{sfn|Jessup|1989|p=}} and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.\n\nDespite the military defeat suffered by the Republicans and a loss of manpower and weaponry that would severely hamper Republican forces for the rest of the revolution, the battle and defence mounted by the Indonesians galvanised the nation in support of independence and helped garner international attention. For the Dutch, it removed any doubt that the Republic was a well-organised resistance with popular support.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=217}} It also convinced Britain to lie on the side of neutrality in the revolution,{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=217}} and within a few years, Britain would support the Republican cause in the United Nations.\n\n===Installing the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Javaanse Revolutionairen strijden voor onafhankelijkheid.

In preparation for the Dutch occupation of Sumatra, its largest cities, Palembang and Medan, were bombed.

As many as 3,000 Republican militia and their supporters were killed in a few weeks.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=224}}\n\nOn Java and Sumatra, the Dutch found military success in cities and major towns, but they were unable to subdue the villages and countryside. On the outer islands (including Bali), Republican sentiment was not as strong, at least among the elite. They were consequently occupied by the Dutch with comparative ease, and autonomous states were set up by the Dutch. The largest, the [[State of East Indonesia]] (NIT), encompassed most of eastern Indonesia, and was established in December 1946, with its administrative capital in [[Makassar]].\n\n==Diplomacy and military offensives==\n\n===Linggadjati Agreement===\nThe [[Linggadjati Agreement]], brokered by the British and concluded in November 1946, saw the Netherlands recognise the Republic as the ''de facto'' authority over Java, [[Madura]], and Sumatra. Both parties agreed to the formation of the [[United States of Indonesia]] by 1 January 1949, a semi-autonomous [[Federation|federal]] state with the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch of the Netherlands]] at its head. The Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra would be one of its states, alongside areas that were generally under stronger Dutch influence, including southern Kalimantan, and the \"[[Great East]]\", which consisted of Sulawesi, Maluku, the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and [[Western New Guinea]]. The Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) did not ratify the agreement until February 1947, and neither the Republic nor the Dutch were satisfied with it.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=35}} On 25 March 1947 the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Lower House of the Dutch parliament]] ratified a stripped down version of the treaty, which was not accepted by the Republic.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=206}} Both sides soon accused the other of violating the agreement.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 30%\n| align  = right\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote  = ...[the Republic] became increasingly disorganised internally; party leaders fought with party leaders; governments were over thrown and replaced by others; armed groups acted on their own in local conflicts; certain parts of the Republic never had contact with the centre-they just drifted along in their own way.\n\nThe whole situation deteriorated to such an extent that the Dutch Government was obliged to decide that no progress could be made before law and order were restored sufficiently to make intercourse between the different parts of Indonesia possible, and to guarantee the safety of people of different political opinions.\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2014 former [[East Indies]] Governor [[Hubertus Johannes van Mook|H.

Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as ''[[politionele acties]]'' (\"police actions\") to restore law and order. This used to be the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the [[Royal Netherlands Army]]. Soon after the end of World War II, 25,000 volunteers (among them 5,000 marines) had been sent overseas. They were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from the Netherlands. In the offensive, Dutch forces drove Republican troops out of parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java. To maintain their force in Java, now numbering 100,000 troops, the Dutch gained control of lucrative Sumatran plantations, and oil and coal installations, and in Java, control of all deep water ports.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Militaire kolonne tijdens de eerste politionele actie TMnr 10029134.jpg|thumb|A Dutch military column during Operation Product]]\n\nInternational reaction to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as were the [[Soviet Union]] and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The [[United Nations Security Council]] became directly involved in the conflict, establishing a [[Good offices|Good Offices Committee]] to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 27|UNSC resolution 27]], was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=226}}\n\n===Renville Agreement===\n{{Main|Renville Agreement}}\n[[File:Van Mook.png|thumb|The Van Mook line in Java. Areas in red were under Republican control.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=233}}]]\n\nThe United Nations Security Council brokered the Renville Agreement in an attempt to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called '[[Van Mook line]]'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=229}} Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=226}}\n\nDiplomatic efforts between the Netherlands and the Republic continued throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, both domestic and international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook's federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=149}} The Netherlands set up the ''Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO)'' (or [[Federal Consultative Assembly]]), a body comprising the leadership of the federal states, and charged with the formation of a [[United States of Indonesia]] and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=150}}\n\nMutual distrust between the Netherlands and the Republic hindered negotiations. The Republic feared a second major Dutch offensive, while the Dutch objected to continued Republican activity on the Dutch side of the Renville line. In February 1948 the Siliwangi Division (35,000 men) of the Republican Army, led by [[Nasution]], marched from West Java to Central Java; the relocation was intended to ease internal Republican tensions involving the Division in the Surakarta area. The Battalion{{Clarify|reason = Battalion or Division?|date=February 2016}}, however, clashed with Dutch troops while crossing [[Mount Slamet]], and the Dutch believed it was part of a systematic troop movement across the Renville Line. The fear of such incursions actually succeeding, along with apparent Republican undermining of the Dutch-established Pasundan state and negative reports, led to the Dutch leadership increasingly seeing itself as losing control.{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\n===Operation Crow and General Offensive (''Serangan Oemoem'')===\n{{quote box\n| width  = 25%\n| align  = right\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote  = We have been attacked....

By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, the location of the temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=152}} The Republican President, Vice-President, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on [[Bangka Island]] off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a [[guerrilla]] war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff [[Sudirman|General Sudirman]] who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the [[Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia|Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia]] (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.\n\n[[File:Een groep Recce M3 Stuart tanks passeert geparkeerde vrachtwagen. Een kapitein \u2026, Bestanddeelnr 5740.jpg|thumb|Dutch forces in the East Indies, 1948]]\nAlthough Dutch forces conquered the towns and cities in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=153}} Republican troops and militia led by [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt. Colonel]] (later President) [[Suharto]] attacked Dutch positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=153}} Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00&nbsp;pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as ''Serangan Oemoem'' (new spelling: ''Serangan Umum'' '[[General Offensive of 1 March 1949|1 March General Offensive]]'), is commemorated by [[Yogya Kembali Monument|a large monument]] in Yogyakarta. A large-scale attack against Dutch troops in [[Surakarta]] on 10 August the same year resulted in republican forces holding the city for two days.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=161}}\n\nOnce again, international opinion of the Dutch military campaigns was one of outrage, significantly in both the United Nations and the United States. In January 1949, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 63|United Nations Security Council passed a resolution]] demanding the reinstatement of the Republican government.{{sfn|Frederick & Worden|1993}} United States aid specifically earmarked for Dutch Indonesia was immediately cancelled and pressure mounted within the [[US Congress]] for all United States aid to be cut off. This included [[Marshall Plan]] funds vital for Dutch post-World War II rebuilding that had so far totalled $US 1&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=37}} The Netherlands Government had spent an amount equivalent to almost half of this funding their campaigns in Indonesia. That United States aid could be used to fund \"a senile and ineffectual imperialism\" encouraged many key voices in the United States \u2013 including those amongst the US [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] \u2013 and from within American churches and NGOs to speak out in support of Indonesian independence.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=38}}\n\n==Internal turmoil==\n\n===Social revolutions===\nThe so-called 'social revolutions' following the independence proclamation were challenges to the Dutch-established Indonesian social order, and to some extent a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=101\u2013104}} The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the challenges to the social order were quashed, although in [[East Sumatra revolution|East Sumatra]], the sultanates were overthrown and there were mass killings of members of the aristocratic families.{{sfn|Colombijn & Linblad |2002|pp =143\u2013173}}{{sfn|Said|1973|pp =145\u2013186}}\n\nA culture of violence rooted in the deep conflicts that split the countryside during the revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout the whole second half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Colombijn & Linblad |2002|pp =143\u2013173}} The term 'social revolution' has been applied to a range of mostly violent activities of the left that included both altruistic attempts to organise real revolution and simple expressions of revenge, resentment and assertions of power. Violence was one of the many lessons learned during the Japanese occupation, and figures identified as '[[feudal]]', including kings, regents, or simply the wealthy, were often attacked and sometimes beheaded. Rape became a weapon against 'feudal' women.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=101\u2013104}} In the coastal sultanates of Sumatra and Kalimantan, for example, [[sultan]]s and others whose authority had been shored-up by the Dutch, were attacked as soon as Japanese authority left. The secular local lords of [[Aceh]], who had been the foundation of Dutch rule, were executed, although most of Indonesia's sultanates fell back into Dutch hands.\n\nMost Indonesians lived in fear and uncertainty, particularly a significant proportion of the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term ''kedaulatan rakyat'' ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') \u2013 which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by ''pemuda'' to demand pro-active policies from leaders \u2013 came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=101\u2013104}}{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=60}}\n\n===Communist and Islamist insurgencies===\n{{Main|Madiun Affair|Darul Islam (Indonesia)}}\nOn 18 September 1948 an 'Indonesian [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] Republic' was declared in Madiun, east of Yogyakarta, by members of the PKI and the [[Socialist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Socialist Party]] (PSI). Judging the time right for a [[proletarian revolution|proletarian uprising]], they intended it to be a rallying point for revolt against \"Sukarno-Hatta, the slaves of the Japanese and America\".{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}} Madiun however was won back by Republican forces within a few weeks and the insurgency leader, Musso, killed. RM [[Suryo]], the governor of East Java, as well as several police officers and religious leaders, were killed by the rebels. This ended a distraction for the revolution,{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}} and it turned vague American sympathies based on anti-colonial sentiments into diplomatic support. Internationally, the Republic was now seen as being staunchly [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and a potential ally in the emerging global [[Cold War]] between the American-led 'free world' and the Soviet-led bloc.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=230}}\n\nMembers of the Republican Army who had come from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they declared a break-away regime, the ''Negara Islam Indonesia'' (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as ''Darul Islam''. Led by an Islamic mystic, [[Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo]], ''Darul Islam'' sought to establish Indonesia as an [[Islamic state|Islamic theocracy]]. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the threat from the Dutch. Some leaders of [[Masjumi]] sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the ''Darul Islam'' threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined ''Darul Islam''. The rebellion was put down in 1962.\n\n==Transfer of sovereignty==\n[[File:Indonesian independence 27 december 1949 Dutch East Indies Independent Newspaper.jpg|thumb|Australia's [[The Northern Star]] newspaper regarding the independence of Indonesia date December 28, 1949]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Sudjana Kerton]] -->\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = Millions upon millions flooded the sidewalks, the roads.

The newly appointed [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference]] was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new [[federal state]] known as the '[[United States of Indonesia]]' (RUSI). It would include all the territory of the former Dutch East Indies with the exception of [[Netherlands New Guinea]]; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of \u00a34.3&nbsp;billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.\n\n[[File:Republik Indonesia Serikat.png|thumb|left|The [[United States of Indonesia]], December 1949 \u2013 the Republic of Indonesia is shown in red.]]\nRepublican-controlled Java and Sumatra together formed a single state in the sixteen-state RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These states were dissolved into the Republic over the first half of 1950. An [[APRA Coup d'\u00e9tat|abortive anti-Republic coup]] in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's [[Legion of Ratu Adil]] (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous [[Pasundan]] state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in [[Makassar]] during the [[Makassar Uprising]] in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent [[Republic of South Maluku]] (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia as a [[unitary state]].{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|Frederick & Worden|1993}}\n\n==Impacts==\n[[File:RI Transfer Signing.jpg|thumb|Indonesian Vice-president [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] and Dutch Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]] at the signing ceremony which took place at the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]].

There were in effect two economies \u2013 the Dutch and the Republican \u2013 both of which had to simultaneously rebuild after World War II and survive the disruptions of the revolution. The Republic had to set up all necessities of life, ranging from '[[postage stamp]]s, army badges, and [[train ticket]]s' whilst subject to Dutch trade blockades. Confusion and ruinous inflationary surges resulted from competing currencies; Japanese, new Dutch money, and Republican currencies were all used, often concurrently.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=101}}\n\nIndonesian independence was secured through a blend of both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without ''pemuda'' confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]], and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country's major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's '[[guided democracy]]', to political Islam, the origins of the Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nThe revolution destroyed a colonial administration ruled from the other side of the world, and dismantled with it the ''raja'', seen by many as obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population's poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=170\u2013171}}\n{{-}}\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n* [[East Sumatra revolution]]\n* [[History of Indonesia]]\n* [[List of high-ranking commanders of the Indonesian War of Independence]]\n* [[Timeline of the Indonesian National Revolution]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.1945-1950ubachsberg.nl/site/erevelden.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110100802/http://www.1945-1950ubachsberg.nl/site/erevelden.htm|website=1945-1950ubachsberg.nl |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite book| last1 =Ashton| first1 =Nigel John | last2 = Hellema| first2 =Duco| title =Unspoken Allies: Anglo-Dutch Relations Since 1780| publisher=Amsterdam University Press| year =2001| isbn =978-90-485-0585-2}}\n* {{cite journal| last =Bidien| first =Charles|title=Independence the Issue|journal=Far Eastern Survey|volume=14|issue=24|pages=345\u2013348|date=5 December 1945|doi=10.1525/as.1945.14.24.01p17062|jstor=3023219}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bussemaker |first=H.Th. |title=Bersiap!

It took place between [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesia's declaration of independence]] in 1945 and the [[Netherlands]]' [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference|recognition of Indonesia's independence]] at the end of 1949.\n\nThe four-year struggle involved sporadic but bloody armed conflict, internal Indonesian political and communal upheavals, and two major international diplomatic interventions. Dutch military forces (and, for a while, the forces of the [[World War II Allies]]) were able to control the major towns, cities and industrial assets in Republican heartlands on [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] but could not control the countryside. By 1949, international pressure on the Netherlands and the partial military [[stalemate]] became such that it recognised Indonesian independence.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=35}}\n\nThe revolution marked the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial administration]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]], except for [[Netherlands New Guinea]]. It also significantly changed ethnic castes as well as reducing the power of many of the local rulers (''[[raja]]''). It did not significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the majority of the population, although a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Indonesian National Awakening|Japanese occupation of Indonesia}}\n\nThe Indonesian independence movement began in May 1908, which is commemorated as the \"[[Indonesian National Awakening|Day of National Awakening]]\" ({{lang-id|Hari Kebangkitan Nasional}}). Indonesian nationalism and movements supporting independence from Dutch colonialism, such as [[Budi Utomo]], the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI), [[Sarekat Islam]] and the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), grew rapidly in the first half of the 20th century. Budi Utomo, Sarekat Islam and others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated ''Volksraad'' (\"People's Council\") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule.{{sfn|Vandenbosch|1931|pp=1051\u2013106}} Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony.{{sfn|Kahin|1980|pp=113\u2013120}} The most notable of these leaders were [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta]], two students and nationalist leaders who had benefited from the educational reforms of the [[Dutch Ethical Policy and Indonesian National Revival|Dutch Ethical Policy]].\n\nThe [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupation of Indonesia by Japan]] for three and a half years during World War II was a crucial factor in the subsequent revolution. The Netherlands had little ability to defend its colony against the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]], and within only three months of their initial attacks, the Japanese had occupied the Dutch East Indies. In Java, and to a lesser extent in Sumatra (Indonesia's two dominant islands), the Japanese spread and encouraged nationalist sentiment. Although this was done more for Japanese political advantage than from altruistic support of Indonesian independence, this support created new Indonesian institutions (including local neighbourhood organisations) and elevated political leaders such as Sukarno. Just as significantly for the subsequent revolution, the Japanese destroyed and replaced much of the Dutch-created economic, administrative, and political infrastructure.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=85}}\n\nOn 7 September 1944, with the war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister [[Kuniaki Koiso|Koiso]] promised independence for Indonesia, but no date was set.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=207}} For supporters of Sukarno, this announcement was seen as vindication for his collaboration with the Japanese.{{sfn|Frederick & Worden|1993}}\n\n==Independence declared==\nUnder pressure from radical and politicised ''pemuda'' ('youth') groups, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]], on 17 August 1945, two days after the Japanese Emperor's [[Victory over Japan Day|surrender in the Pacific]].

As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=214\u2013215}}  External power had shifted; it would be weeks before [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] shipping entered Indonesia (owing in part to [[Black Armada|boycotts and strikes, in Australia]], on coaling, loading and manning Dutch shipping from Australia where the Netherlands East Indies Government in exile was based). These strikes were only fully broken in July 1946.{{sfn|Lockwood|1975}} The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|Crib|1996|pp=72\u201385}}\n\nThe resulting power vacuums in the weeks following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}} Many ''pemuda'' joined pro-Republic struggle groups (''badan perjuangan''). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded ''Giyugun'' ([[PETA (Indonesia)|PETA]], volunteer army) and ''Heiho'' (local soldiers employed by Japanese armed forces) groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary spirit. In the first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\nBy September 1945, control of major infrastructure installations, including railway stations and trams in Java's largest cities, had been taken over by Republican ''pemuda'' who encountered little Japanese resistance.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=215\u2013216}} To spread the revolutionary message, ''pemuda'' set up their own radio stations and newspapers, and graffiti proclaimed the nationalist sentiment. On most islands, struggle committees and [[militia]] were set up.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=198}} Republican newspapers and journals were common in Jakarta, [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], and [[Surakarta]], which fostered a generation of writers known as ''angkatan 45'' ('generation of 45') many of whom believed their work could be part of the revolution.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\nRepublican leaders struggled to come to terms with popular sentiment; some wanted passionate armed struggle; others a more reasoned approach. Some leaders, such as the leftist [[Tan Malaka]], spread the idea that this was a revolutionary struggle to be led and won by the Indonesian ''pemuda''. Sukarno and Hatta, in contrast, were more interested in planning out a government and institutions to achieve independence through diplomacy.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=97}} Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled.\n\nBy September 1945, many of the self-proclaimed ''pemuda'', who were ready to die for '100% freedom', were getting impatient. It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' \u2013 Dutch internees, [[Indo people|Eurasian]], [[Ambon Island|Ambonese]] and [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] \u2013 and anyone considered to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnap, robbery, murder and organised massacres. Such attacks would continue throughout the course of the revolution, but were most present during the 1945\u201346 period, which is known as the [[Bersiap]].{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=49}}{{sfn|Fenton-Huie|1992|p=}}{{sfn|Reid|1981|pp=107\u2013157}}\n\nAfter the Bersiap in 1947 Dutch authorities attempted to retrieve the bodies of the victims and several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the Attorney General office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of ''Bersiap'' victims can be found in the ''Kembang Kuning'' war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere.\n\nThe ''Simpang Society Club Surabaya'' was appropriated by the Pemudas of the ''Partai Rakyat Indonesia'' (P.R.I.) and made into the headquarters of P.R.I. commander [[Sutomo]], who personally supervised the summary executions of hundreds of civilians. An archived eyewitness testimony of the events of 22 October 1945 states:\n\n<blockquote>Before each execution Sutomo mockingly asked the crowd what should be done with this \"Musuh (enemy) of the people\". The crowd yelled \"Bunuh!\" (kill!) after which the executioner named Rustam decapitated the victim with one stroke of his sword. The victim was then left to the bloodthirst of boys 10, 11 and 12 years old. ...[who] further mutilated the body.\" \"Women were tied to the tree in the back yard and pierced through the genitals with \"[[bambu runcing]]\" (bamboo spears) until they died.</blockquote>\n\nOn Sutomo's orders the decapitated bodies were disposed of in the sea, the women were thrown in the river.<ref>Note: These legal testimonies formerly designated ''top secret'' have been made public and are available online.

It adopted [[Constitution of Indonesia|a constitution]] drafted during the Japanese occupation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence. With general elections yet to be held, a [[Central Indonesian National Committee]] (KNIP) was appointed to assist the President. Similar committees were established at provincial and regency levels.\n\nQuestions of allegiance immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. [[Central Java]]nese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many ''raja'' ('rulers') of the outer islands, who had been enriched from their support of the Dutch, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from [[South Sulawesi]] (including the King of [[Bone state|Bone]], who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in the century), and from [[Makassarese]] and [[Bugis]] ''raja'', who supported the Republican Governor of Jakarta, a [[Menado]]nese Christian. Many [[Bali]]nese ''raja'' accepted Republican authority.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=214}}\n\nFearing the Dutch would attempt to re-establish their authority over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely in contact with the outer islands,{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=33}} which had more Japanese troops (particularly in [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese naval]] areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=215}} In November 1945, a [[parliamentary|parliamentary form of government]] was established and [[Sutan Sjahrir|Sjahrir]] was appointed Prime Minister.\n\nIn the week following the Japanese surrender, the Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups were disbanded by the Japanese.<ref>Most PETA and Heiho members did not yet know about the declaration of independence.</ref> Command structures and membership vital for a national army were consequently dismantled.

Allied enclaves already existed in [[Kalimantan]] (Indonesian [[Borneo]]), [[Morotai]] ([[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]) and parts of [[Irian Jaya]]; Dutch administrators had already returned to these areas.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=215}} In the Japanese navy areas, the arrival of Allied troops quickly prevented revolutionary activities where Australian troops, followed by Dutch troops and administrators, took the Japanese surrender (except for [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]]).{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}} Due to the lack of strong resistance, two [[Australian Army]] divisions succeeded in occupying eastern Indonesia.{{sfn|Ashton & Hellema|2001|p=181}}\n[[File:The British Occupation of Java SE6731.jpg|thumb|left|Indian and British troops move cautiously along a jungle track round the town of [[Gresik]].]]\n\nThe British were charged with restoring order and civilian government in Java. The Dutch took this to mean pre-war colonial administration and continued to claim sovereignty over Indonesia.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=97}} The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[British Raj|Indian]] troops did not, however, land on Java to accept the Japanese surrender until late September 1945. Lord Mountbatten's immediate tasks included the repatriation of some 300,000 Japanese, and freeing prisoners of war. He did not want, nor did he have the resources, to commit his troops to a long struggle to regain Indonesia for the Dutch.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=99}} The first British troops reached Jakarta in late September 1945, and arrived in the cities of [[Medan]] ([[North Sumatra]]), [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] ([[West Sumatra]]), [[Palembang]] ([[South Sumatra]]), [[Semarang]] ([[Central Java]]) and [[Surabaya]] ([[East Java]]) in October. In an attempt to avoid clashes with Indonesians, the British commander Lieutenant General Sir [[Philip Christison]] diverted soldiers of the former Dutch colonial army to eastern Indonesia, where Dutch reoccupation was proceeding smoothly.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}} Tensions mounted as Allied troops entered Java and Sumatra; clashes broke out between Republicans and their perceived enemies, namely Dutch prisoners, [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Dutch colonial troops (KNIL)]], Chinese, [[Indo (Eurasian)|Indo-Europeans]] and Japanese.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}}\n\nThe first stages of warfare were initiated in October 1945 when, in accordance with the terms of their surrender, the Japanese tried to re-establish the authority they had relinquished to Indonesians in the towns and cities. Japanese military police killed Republican ''pemuda'' in [[Pekalongan]] (Central Java) on 3 October, and Japanese troops drove Republican ''pemuda'' out of [[Bandung]] in [[West Java]] and handed the city to the British, but the fiercest fighting involving the Japanese was in Semarang. On 14 October, British forces began to occupy the city. Retreating Republican forces retaliated by killing between 130 and 300 Japanese prisoners they were holding. Five hundred Japanese and two thousand Indonesians had been killed and the Japanese had almost captured the city six days later when British forces arrived.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}} The Allies repatriated the remaining Japanese troops and civilians to Japan, although about 1,000 elected to remain behind and later assisted Republican forces in fighting for independence.{{sfn|Tjandraningsih|2011|p=3}}\n[[File:Een sectie militairen tijdens een rustpauze, Bestanddeelnr 15857.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch soldiers in the East Indies, 1946]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Vernielingen in de Chinese wijk TMnr 10014680.jpg|thumb|Destruction in Bandung's Chinese quarter]]\nThe British subsequently decided to evacuate the 10,000 Indo-Europeans and European internees in the volatile Central Java interior. British detachments sent to the towns of [[Ambarawa]] and [[Magelang]] encountered strong Republican resistance and used air attacks against the Indonesians. Sukarno arranged a ceasefire on 2 November, but by late November fighting had resumed and the British withdrew to the coast.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=216}}{{sfn|McMillan|2005|pp=306\u2013307}} Republican attacks against Allied and alleged pro-Dutch civilians reached a peak in November and December, with 1,200 killed in Bandung as the ''pemuda'' returned to the offensive.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=54}} In March 1946, departing Republicans responded to a British ultimatum for them to leave the city of Bandung by deliberately burning down much of the southern half of the city in what is popularly known in Indonesia as the \"[[Bandung Sea of Fire]]\".

Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November{{sfn|Jessup|1989|p=}} and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.\n\nDespite the military defeat suffered by the Republicans and a loss of manpower and weaponry that would severely hamper Republican forces for the rest of the revolution, the battle and defence mounted by the Indonesians galvanised the nation in support of independence and helped garner international attention. For the Dutch, it removed any doubt that the Republic was a well-organised resistance with popular support.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=217}} It also convinced Britain to lie on the side of neutrality in the revolution,{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=217}} and within a few years, Britain would support the Republican cause in the United Nations.\n\n===Installing the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Javaanse Revolutionairen strijden voor onafhankelijkheid.

Yogyakarta went on to play a leading role in the revolution, which would result in the city being granted its own Special Territory status.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=420}} In [[Bogor]], near Jakarta, and in [[Balikpapan]] in Kalimantan, Republican officials were imprisoned. In preparation for the Dutch occupation of Sumatra, its largest cities, Palembang and Medan, were bombed.

As many as 3,000 Republican militia and their supporters were killed in a few weeks.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=224}}\n\nOn Java and Sumatra, the Dutch found military success in cities and major towns, but they were unable to subdue the villages and countryside. On the outer islands (including Bali), Republican sentiment was not as strong, at least among the elite. They were consequently occupied by the Dutch with comparative ease, and autonomous states were set up by the Dutch. The largest, the [[State of East Indonesia]] (NIT), encompassed most of eastern Indonesia, and was established in December 1946, with its administrative capital in [[Makassar]].\n\n==Diplomacy and military offensives==\n\n===Linggadjati Agreement===\nThe [[Linggadjati Agreement]], brokered by the British and concluded in November 1946, saw the Netherlands recognise the Republic as the ''de facto'' authority over Java, [[Madura]], and Sumatra.

The Republican-controlled Java and Sumatra would be one of its states, alongside areas that were generally under stronger Dutch influence, including southern Kalimantan, and the \"[[Great East]]\", which consisted of Sulawesi, Maluku, the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and [[Western New Guinea]]. The Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) did not ratify the agreement until February 1947, and neither the Republic nor the Dutch were satisfied with it.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=35}} On 25 March 1947 the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Lower House of the Dutch parliament]] ratified a stripped down version of the treaty, which was not accepted by the Republic.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=206}} Both sides soon accused the other of violating the agreement.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 30%\n| align  = right\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote  = ...[the Republic] became increasingly disorganised internally; party leaders fought with party leaders; governments were over thrown and replaced by others; armed groups acted on their own in local conflicts; certain parts of the Republic never had contact with the centre-they just drifted along in their own way.\n\nThe whole situation deteriorated to such an extent that the Dutch Government was obliged to decide that no progress could be made before law and order were restored sufficiently to make intercourse between the different parts of Indonesia possible, and to guarantee the safety of people of different political opinions.\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2014 former [[East Indies]] Governor [[Hubertus Johannes van Mook|H. J. van Mook]]'s justification for [[Operatie Product|the first Dutch \"police action\"]].{{sfn|van Mook|1949|p=298}}}}\n\n===Operation Product===\n{{Main|Operatie Product}}\nAt midnight on 20 July 1947, the Dutch launched a major military offensive called ''Operatie Product'', with the intent of conquering the Republic. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as ''[[politionele acties]]'' (\"police actions\") to restore law and order. This used to be the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the [[Royal Netherlands Army]]. Soon after the end of World War II, 25,000 volunteers (among them 5,000 marines) had been sent overseas. They were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from the Netherlands. In the offensive, Dutch forces drove Republican troops out of parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java. To maintain their force in Java, now numbering 100,000 troops, the Dutch gained control of lucrative Sumatran plantations, and oil and coal installations, and in Java, control of all deep water ports.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Militaire kolonne tijdens de eerste politionele actie TMnr 10029134.jpg|thumb|A Dutch military column during Operation Product]]\n\nInternational reaction to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as were the [[Soviet Union]] and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The [[United Nations Security Council]] became directly involved in the conflict, establishing a [[Good offices|Good Offices Committee]] to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 27|UNSC resolution 27]], was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=226}}\n\n===Renville Agreement===\n{{Main|Renville Agreement}}\n[[File:Van Mook.png|thumb|The Van Mook line in Java. Areas in red were under Republican control.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=233}}]]\n\nThe United Nations Security Council brokered the Renville Agreement in an attempt to rectify the collapsed Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called '[[Van Mook line]]'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions.{{sfn|Kahin|1952|p=229}} Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=226}}\n\nDiplomatic efforts between the Netherlands and the Republic continued throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, both domestic and international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook's federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=149}} The Netherlands set up the ''Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO)'' (or [[Federal Consultative Assembly]]), a body comprising the leadership of the federal states, and charged with the formation of a [[United States of Indonesia]] and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=150}}\n\nMutual distrust between the Netherlands and the Republic hindered negotiations. The Republic feared a second major Dutch offensive, while the Dutch objected to continued Republican activity on the Dutch side of the Renville line. In February 1948 the Siliwangi Division (35,000 men) of the Republican Army, led by [[Nasution]], marched from West Java to Central Java; the relocation was intended to ease internal Republican tensions involving the Division in the Surakarta area. The Battalion{{Clarify|reason = Battalion or Division?|date=February 2016}}, however, clashed with Dutch troops while crossing [[Mount Slamet]], and the Dutch believed it was part of a systematic troop movement across the Renville Line. The fear of such incursions actually succeeding, along with apparent Republican undermining of the Dutch-established Pasundan state and negative reports, led to the Dutch leadership increasingly seeing itself as losing control.{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=149\u2013151}}\n\n===Operation Crow and General Offensive (''Serangan Oemoem'')===\n{{quote box\n| width  = 25%\n| align  = right\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote  = We have been attacked....

By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, the location of the temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=152}} The Republican President, Vice-President, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on [[Bangka Island]] off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a [[guerrilla]] war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff [[Sudirman|General Sudirman]] who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the [[Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia|Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia]] (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.\n\n[[File:Een groep Recce M3 Stuart tanks passeert geparkeerde vrachtwagen. Een kapitein \u2026, Bestanddeelnr 5740.jpg|thumb|Dutch forces in the East Indies, 1948]]\nAlthough Dutch forces conquered the towns and cities in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=153}} Republican troops and militia led by [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt. Colonel]] (later President) [[Suharto]] attacked Dutch positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The Dutch were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=153}} Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00&nbsp;pm and the Dutch re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as ''Serangan Oemoem'' (new spelling: ''Serangan Umum'' '[[General Offensive of 1 March 1949|1 March General Offensive]]'), is commemorated by [[Yogya Kembali Monument|a large monument]] in Yogyakarta. A large-scale attack against Dutch troops in [[Surakarta]] on 10 August the same year resulted in republican forces holding the city for two days.{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=161}}\n\nOnce again, international opinion of the Dutch military campaigns was one of outrage, significantly in both the United Nations and the United States. In January 1949, the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 63|United Nations Security Council passed a resolution]] demanding the reinstatement of the Republican government.{{sfn|Frederick & Worden|1993}} United States aid specifically earmarked for Dutch Indonesia was immediately cancelled and pressure mounted within the [[US Congress]] for all United States aid to be cut off. This included [[Marshall Plan]] funds vital for Dutch post-World War II rebuilding that had so far totalled $US 1&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=37}} The Netherlands Government had spent an amount equivalent to almost half of this funding their campaigns in Indonesia. That United States aid could be used to fund \"a senile and ineffectual imperialism\" encouraged many key voices in the United States \u2013 including those amongst the US [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] \u2013 and from within American churches and NGOs to speak out in support of Indonesian independence.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=38}}\n\n==Internal turmoil==\n\n===Social revolutions===\nThe so-called 'social revolutions' following the independence proclamation were challenges to the Dutch-established Indonesian social order, and to some extent a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=101\u2013104}} The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the challenges to the social order were quashed, although in [[East Sumatra revolution|East Sumatra]], the sultanates were overthrown and there were mass killings of members of the aristocratic families.{{sfn|Colombijn & Linblad |2002|pp =143\u2013173}}{{sfn|Said|1973|pp =145\u2013186}}\n\nA culture of violence rooted in the deep conflicts that split the countryside during the revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout the whole second half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Colombijn & Linblad |2002|pp =143\u2013173}} The term 'social revolution' has been applied to a range of mostly violent activities of the left that included both altruistic attempts to organise real revolution and simple expressions of revenge, resentment and assertions of power. Violence was one of the many lessons learned during the Japanese occupation, and figures identified as '[[feudal]]', including kings, regents, or simply the wealthy, were often attacked and sometimes beheaded. Rape became a weapon against 'feudal' women.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=101\u2013104}} In the coastal sultanates of Sumatra and Kalimantan, for example, [[sultan]]s and others whose authority had been shored-up by the Dutch, were attacked as soon as Japanese authority left. The secular local lords of [[Aceh]], who had been the foundation of Dutch rule, were executed, although most of Indonesia's sultanates fell back into Dutch hands.\n\nMost Indonesians lived in fear and uncertainty, particularly a significant proportion of the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term ''kedaulatan rakyat'' ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') \u2013 which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by ''pemuda'' to demand pro-active policies from leaders \u2013 came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=101\u2013104}}{{sfn|Reid|1974|p=60}}\n\n===Communist and Islamist insurgencies===\n{{Main|Madiun Affair|Darul Islam (Indonesia)}}\nOn 18 September 1948 an 'Indonesian [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] Republic' was declared in Madiun, east of Yogyakarta, by members of the PKI and the [[Socialist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Socialist Party]] (PSI). Judging the time right for a [[proletarian revolution|proletarian uprising]], they intended it to be a rallying point for revolt against \"Sukarno-Hatta, the slaves of the Japanese and America\".{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}} Madiun however was won back by Republican forces within a few weeks and the insurgency leader, Musso, killed. RM [[Suryo]], the governor of East Java, as well as several police officers and religious leaders, were killed by the rebels. This ended a distraction for the revolution,{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=32}} and it turned vague American sympathies based on anti-colonial sentiments into diplomatic support. Internationally, the Republic was now seen as being staunchly [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and a potential ally in the emerging global [[Cold War]] between the American-led 'free world' and the Soviet-led bloc.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=230}}\n\nMembers of the Republican Army who had come from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they declared a break-away regime, the ''Negara Islam Indonesia'' (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as ''Darul Islam''. Led by an Islamic mystic, [[Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo]], ''Darul Islam'' sought to establish Indonesia as an [[Islamic state|Islamic theocracy]]. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the threat from the Dutch. Some leaders of [[Masjumi]] sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the ''Darul Islam'' threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined ''Darul Islam''. The rebellion was put down in 1962.\n\n==Transfer of sovereignty==\n[[File:Indonesian independence 27 december 1949 Dutch East Indies Independent Newspaper.jpg|thumb|Australia's [[The Northern Star]] newspaper regarding the independence of Indonesia date December 28, 1949]]\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Sudjana Kerton]] -->\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| fontsize = 95%\n| quote = Millions upon millions flooded the sidewalks, the roads.

The newly appointed [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference]] was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new [[federal state]] known as the '[[United States of Indonesia]]' (RUSI). It would include all the territory of the former Dutch East Indies with the exception of [[Netherlands New Guinea]]; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of \u00a34.3&nbsp;billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.\n\n[[File:Republik Indonesia Serikat.png|thumb|left|The [[United States of Indonesia]], December 1949 \u2013 the Republic of Indonesia is shown in red.]]\nRepublican-controlled Java and Sumatra together formed a single state in the sixteen-state RUSI federation, but accounted for almost half its population. The other fifteen 'federal' states had been created by the Netherlands since 1945. These states were dissolved into the Republic over the first half of 1950. An [[APRA Coup d'\u00e9tat|abortive anti-Republic coup]] in Bandung and Jakarta by Westerling's [[Legion of Ratu Adil]] (APRA) on 23 January 1950 resulted in the dissolution of the populous [[Pasundan]] state in West Java, thus quickening the dissolution of the federal structure. Colonial soldiers, who were largely Ambonese, clashed with Republican troops in [[Makassar]] during the [[Makassar Uprising]] in April 1950. The predominantly Christian Ambonese were from one of the few regions with pro-Dutch sentiments and they were suspicious of the Javanese Muslim-dominated Republic, whom they unfavourably regarded as leftists. On 25 April 1950, an independent [[Republic of South Maluku]] (RMS) was proclaimed in Ambon but this was suppressed by Republican troops during a campaign from July to November. With the state of East Sumatra now being the only federal state remaining, it too folded and fell in line with the unitary Republic. On 17 August 1950, the fifth anniversary of his declaration of Indonesian independence, Sukarno proclaimed the Republic of Indonesia as a [[unitary state]].{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|Frederick & Worden|1993}}\n\n==Impacts==\n[[File:RI Transfer Signing.jpg|thumb|Indonesian Vice-president [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] and Dutch Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Juliana]] at the signing ceremony which took place at the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]].

There were in effect two economies \u2013 the Dutch and the Republican \u2013 both of which had to simultaneously rebuild after World War II and survive the disruptions of the revolution. The Republic had to set up all necessities of life, ranging from '[[postage stamp]]s, army badges, and [[train ticket]]s' whilst subject to Dutch trade blockades. Confusion and ruinous inflationary surges resulted from competing currencies; Japanese, new Dutch money, and Republican currencies were all used, often concurrently.{{sfn|Vickers|2005|p=101}}\n\nIndonesian independence was secured through a blend of both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without ''pemuda'' confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]], and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country's major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's '[[guided democracy]]', to political Islam, the origins of the Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nThe revolution destroyed a colonial administration ruled from the other side of the world, and dismantled with it the ''raja'', seen by many as obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population's poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.{{sfn|Reid|1974|pp=170\u2013171}}\n{{-}}\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n* [[East Sumatra revolution]]\n* [[History of Indonesia]]\n* [[List of high-ranking commanders of the Indonesian War of Independence]]\n* [[Timeline of the Indonesian National Revolution]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.1945-1950ubachsberg.nl/site/erevelden.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110100802/http://www.1945-1950ubachsberg.nl/site/erevelden.htm|website=1945-1950ubachsberg.nl |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite book| last1 =Ashton| first1 =Nigel John | last2 = Hellema| first2 =Duco| title =Unspoken Allies: Anglo-Dutch Relations Since 1780| publisher=Amsterdam University Press| year =2001| isbn =978-90-485-0585-2}}\n* {{cite journal| last =Bidien| first =Charles|title=Independence the Issue|journal=Far Eastern Survey|volume=14|issue=24|pages=345\u2013348|date=5 December 1945|doi=10.1525/as.1945.14.24.01p17062|jstor=3023219}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Bussemaker |first=H.Th. |title=Bersiap!

Growing up, his only passion was football.<ref name=kameraadjes/>\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Youth career===\nBiseswar's first football club was amateur club [[AFC DWS|DWS]]. He joined [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after a year. After five seasons with Ajax, he was deemed \"unmanageable\" and was released.<ref>{{cite news|title=Het jongensboek van een Amsterdams lefgozertje|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/het-jongensboek-van-een-amsterdams-lefgozertje~a681877/|newspaper=Volkskrant|language=nl |trans-title=The story of an Amsterdam boy with guts|date=21 November 2005|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref> Bisewar has stated that he was happy to leave Ajax, saying that \"Ajax thought I wasn't good enough and I wanted to leave myself. I didn't feel at ease, many friends were leaving and my relationship with the coach wasn't optimal. It was unfortunate, but there were no dreams in tatters.\"<ref name=\"kameraadjes\"/>\n\nBiseswar returned to former club DWS, before leaving again to play for [[Telstar (football club)|Telstar]]. After one season, Biseswar was asked to join the [[Feyenoord]] youth academy, a move he was happy to make: \"I visited them a few times and was quickly convinced.
