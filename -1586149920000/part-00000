By 5:00 pm the Texans captured 160 women and children and drove off the remaining pro-Union Indians. Later, pro-Confederate Indians arrived and continued the pursuit; allegedly as many as 700 people were killed or died of exposure.

On 25 February 1862, the Texans overpowered the Federal outpost, killing two and capturing one while losing two men wounded and one or two missing.

Each year, he has adopted a different theme for ''Monster Madness''. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was ''Godzillathon'', in which he reviewed all of the Godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was ''Monster Madness Three'', which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was ''Camp Cult'', which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as ''Troll 2''. 2011 was ''Sequel-A-Thon'', which dealt with horror sequels. And 2012 was ''80's-a-Thon'', which included only movies made in the 1980s. While the first five years of ''Monster Madness'' have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's ''80's-a-Thon'' series of ''Monster Madness'' was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of ''The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie''.

Each year, he has adopted a different theme for ''Monster Madness''. 2007 was the history of horror. 2008 was ''Godzillathon'', in which he reviewed all of the Godzilla films chronologically. 2009 was ''Monster Madness Three'', which dealt with a variety of popular and little known films of horror. 2010 was ''Camp Cult'', which dealt with both campy horror films as well as cult classic films, such as ''Troll 2''. 2011 was ''Sequel-A-Thon'', which dealt with horror sequels. And 2012 was ''80's-a-Thon'', which included only movies made in the 1980s. While the first five years of ''Monster Madness'' have been one film review per day for the entirety of the month of October 2012's ''80's-a-Thon'' series of ''Monster Madness'' was reduced to every other day of October due to the production of ''The Angry Video Game Nerd Movie''. Despite the decreased number of film reviews, the film reviews in ''80's-a-Thon'' were longer than previous reviews on ''Monster Madness''.<ref name=\"career\" /> With October 2013's ''Sequel-A-Thon 2'', ''Monster Madness'' has returned to one review per day. 2013 was ''Sequel-A-Thon 2'', which dealt with more horror sequels. The final 31 marathon ''Monster Madness'' series ran during October 2016. Rolfe expressed his desire to move onto other Halloween-themed projects and reviews in the future, but said that ''Monster Madness'' will always live on in some way.<ref>{{cite news | first=Mike | last=Matei | title=Monster Madness X Promo | website=Cinemassacre.com | date=2016-09-22 | url=https://cinemassacre.com/2016/09/22/monster-madness-x-promo/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023035023/https://cinemassacre.com/2016/09/22/monster-madness-x-promo/ | archive-date=October 23, 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, ''Son of Monster Madness'' debuted, which consisted simply of five new reviews, with the rest of October bulked by reuploads of older reviews previously not available on YouTube.\n\nOn May 17, 2016, James uploaded a video to Cinemassacre's YouTube channel in which he expressed unhappiness with the [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 ''Ghostbusters'' reboot film]] and how he planned on not seeing it or releasing a review. Rolfe criticized the film's lack of originality but had no problem with the female cast. This stance was criticized by some in the entertainment industry, with many theorizing that a significant portion of fan backlash against the movie was being grounded in sexism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sims |first=Davis |date=May 18, 2016 |title=The Ongoing Outcry Against the Ghostbusters Remake |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-sexist-outcry-against-the-ghostbusters-remake-gets-louder/483270/ |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725230551/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-sexist-outcry-against-the-ghostbusters-remake-gets-louder/483270/ |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was raised in New Jersey and has an Italian ethnic background.<ref>{{Cite AV Media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YneqewcVLVY&t=807s | title=Top 10 Popular Films I Don't Love | publisher=Cinemassacre | format=YouTube | date=September 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRolfe attended the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]] from 1999 to 2004.

In addition to his other siblings, Dietrich had a twin sister, [[Bonhoeffer family|Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz]]:  he and Sabine were the sixth and seventh children out of eight. His father was [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]] [[Karl Bonhoeffer]], noted for his criticism of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and his mother Paula Bonhoeffer, n\u00e9e von Hase, was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian [[Karl Hase|Karl von Hase]] and painter [[Stanislaus von  Kalckreuth]]. Bonhoeffer's family dynamic and his parents values enabled him to receive a high level of education and also encouraged his curiosity, which in turn impacted his ability to lead others around him, specifically in the church setting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forged In Crisis: The Making of Five Courageous Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2003|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=New York, NY|pages=287}}</ref> His oldest brother [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] became a chemist, and, along with [[Paul Harteck]], discovered the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] in 1929. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during World War I, when the twins were 12. The third Bonhoeffer child, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer|Klaus]], was a lawyer until he was executed for his involvement in the [[20 July plot]].{{sfn | Bonhoeffer | Barnett | Schulz | 2011 | p=581}}{{sfn | Bethge | Barnett | 1999 | p=18,625}}{{sfn | Root | 2014 | p=119}} \n\nBoth of Bonhoeffer's older sisters, [[Bonhoeffer family|Ursula Bonhoeffer Schleicher and Christel Bonhoeffer von Dohnanyi]], married men who were eventually executed by the Nazis. Christel was imprisoned by the Nazis but survived. Sabine and their youngest sister Susanne Bonhoeffer Dress each married men who survived Nazism. His cousin [[Karl-G\u00fcnther von Hase]] was the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nBonhoeffer completed his ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', the equivalent of both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. He went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree (Dr. theol.) from [[Berlin University]] in 1927, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]''.\n\n=== Studies in America ===\nStill too young to be ordained, at the age of twenty-four Bonhoeffer went to the United States in 1930 for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study and a teaching fellowship at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. Although Bonhoeffer found the American seminary not up to his exacting German standards (\"There is no theology here.\"),<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\">David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 45</ref> he had life-changing experiences and friendships. He studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and met Frank Fisher, a black fellow-seminarian who introduced him to [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], where Bonhoeffer taught [[Sunday school]] and formed a lifelong love for African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], a collection of which he took back to Germany. He heard [[Adam Clayton Powell Sr.]] preach the Gospel of Social Justice, and became sensitive to not only social injustices experienced by minorities, but also the ineptitude of the church to bring about integration.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html |work=PBS|title=Bonhoeffer Timeline}}</ref> \n\nBonhoeffer began to see things \"from below\"\u2014from the perspective of those who suffer oppression. He observed, \"Here one can truly speak and hear about sin and grace and the love of God...the Black Christ is preached with rapturous passion and vision.\" Later Bonhoeffer referred to his impressions abroad as the point at which he \"turned from phraseology to reality.\"<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\" /> He also learned to drive an automobile, although he failed the driving test three times.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=[[Mark Galli|Galli, Mark]] and Barbara | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3202.html |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Did You Know?| journal=Christian History| issue =32| date=1991}}</ref> He borrowed a 1924 Oldsmobile sedan from a member of the Greenville Community Church in Westchester County in order to drive to Mexico. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.greenvillechurch.org/dietrich-bohnoeffer-friend-of-greenville-community-church|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, friend of Greenville Community Church|website=Greenville Community Church|language=en-US|access-date=18 October 2019}} </ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R0211-316, Dietrich Bonhoeffer mit Sch\u00fclern.jpg|thumb|Dietrich Bonhoeffer on a weekend getaway with [[Confirmand#Protestant views|confirmands]] of Zion's Church congregation (1932)<ref>''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, pp. 31, 33. No ISBN.</ref>]]\n\nAfter returning to Germany in 1931, Bonhoeffer became a lecturer in [[systematic theology]] at the University of Berlin. Deeply interested in [[ecumenism]], he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the [[World Council of Churches]]) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone something of a personal conversion from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity to being a dedicated man of faith, resolved to carry out the teaching of Christ as he found it revealed in the Gospels.<ref name=\"Michael Balfour p216\">Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p. 216</ref> On 15 November 1931\u2014at the age of 25\u2014he was ordained at [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|Old-Prussian United]] {{ill|St. Matthew, Berlin-Tiergarten|de|Matth\u00e4uskirche (Berlin-Tiergarten)|St. Matthew}} in Berlin-Tiergarten.\n\n=== Confessing Church ===\nBonhoeffer's promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically altered with the Nazi ascension to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the ''F\u00fchrer'' (leader), who could very well turn out to be ''Verf\u00fchrer'' (mis-leader, or seducer). He was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible.<ref>Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', pp. 259\u201360</ref> In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply \"bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam a spoke in the wheel itself.\"<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 38</ref>\n\nIn November 1932, two months before the Nazi takeover, there had been an election for [[presbyter]]s and [[synod]]als (church officials) of the German ''Landeskirche'' (Protestant historical established churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic [[German Christian]] (Deutsche Christen) movement and Young Reformers\u2014a struggle which threatened to explode into [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials.\n\nDespite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming number of key church positions went to Nazi-supported Deutsche Christen people.<ref>Elizabeth Raum, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', p. 72</ref> The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|Westphalia]], and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Hanover]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The non-Nazi opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted \"intact churches,\" as opposed to the other so-called \"destroyed churches.\"\n\nIn opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict upon all pastoral services (baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.), but [[Karl Barth]] and others advised against such a radical proposal.<ref>{{Citation |date=June 2007 | contribution-url = http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2007/06/ten-theses-on-dietrich-bonhoeffer.html | title = Faith and Theology | contribution = Ten theses on Dietrich Bonhoeffer | publisher = [[Blogspot]]}}.</ref> In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and [[Hermann Sasse]] were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the [[Bethel Institution|Bethel Confession]],<ref name=\"Obendiek 1992 57\">Enno Obendiek, \u201eDie Theologische Erkl\u00e4rung von Barmen 1934: Hinf\u00fchrung\u201c, in: ''\u201e\u2026 den gro\u00dfen Zwecken des Christenthums gem\u00e4\u00df\u201c: Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992; Eine Handreichung f\u00fcr die Gemeinden'', Wilhelm H\u00fcffmeier (compilator) for the Kirchenkanzlei der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp.&nbsp;52\u201358 [57]. {{ISBN|3-7858-0346-X}}</ref> a new statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God's fidelity to Jews as His chosen people, the Bethel Confession was so watered down to make it more palatable that Bonhoeffer ultimately refused to sign it.<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 47</ref>\n\nIn September 1933, the national church synod at [[Wittenberg]] voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the [[Aryan paragraph]] within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of [[baptism]], [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] founded the ''[[Pfarrernotbund]]'' (Pastors' Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the [[Old Testament]] from the Bible, which was seen by many as [[heresy]], further swelling the ranks of the Emergency League.<ref>Robert P.

He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, \"I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: 'And what of the German Church?'\" Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his \"splendid theological armory\" while \"the house of your church is on fire,\" and chided him to return to Berlin \"by the next ship.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: London 1933\u20131935'', p. 40</ref>\n\nBonhoeffer, however, did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home; he hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niem\u00f6ller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with the Christian gospel. When Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Heckel|de}}\u2014the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs\u2014traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom,'' ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p. 19</ref>\n\n=== Underground seminaries ===\nIn 1935, Bonhoeffer was offered a well-sought-after opportunity to study non-violent resistance under [[Gandhi]] in his [[ashram]]. However, remembering Barth's rebuke, Bonhoeffer decided to return to Germany instead, where he was the head at an underground seminary in [[Szczecin-Zdroje|Finkenwalde]] for training Confessing Church pastors.  As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to Switzerland in 1935; Niem\u00f6ller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer's authorization to teach at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was revoked after he was denounced as a \"[[pacifist]] and enemy of the state\" by Theodor Heckel.[[File:Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Skulptur an der Hauptkirche Sankt Petri (Hamburg).JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], Hamburg]]Bonhoeffer's efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds. He found a great benefactor in [[Ruth von Kleist-Retzow]]. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer's former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter, [[Maria von Wedemeyer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/februaryweb-only/33.0a.html|title=Bonhoeffer in Love|author=Wendy Murray Zoba|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest. By August 1937, [[Himmler]] decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the Gestapo closed the seminary at Finkenwalde, and by November arrested 27 pastors and former students. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]],'' a study on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which he not only attacked \"cheap grace\" as a cover for ethical laxity, but also preached \"costly grace.\"\n\nBonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct \"seminary on the run\" supervision of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian [[Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania]]. The [[von Blumenthal]] family hosted the seminary on its estate of [[S\u0142onowice, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz]]. The pastors of Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later edited Bonhoeffer's ''Letters and Papers from Prison'') as vicars in their congregations.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\">''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Gestapo banned Bonhoeffer from Berlin. In summer 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate ([[Folwark|Vorwerk]]) of the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Tychowo, S\u0142awno County|Wendish Tychow]]. In March 1940, the Gestapo shut down the seminary there following the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\" /> Bonhoeffer's monastic communal life and teaching at Finkenwalde seminary formed the basis of his books, ''The Cost of Discipleship'' and ''Life Together.''\n\nBonhoeffer's sister, Sabine, along with her Jewish-classified husband Gerhard Leibholz and their two daughters, escaped to England by way of Switzerland in September 1940.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html | publisher = PBS | title = Bonhoeffer | contribution = Timeline}}.</ref>\n\n=== Return to the United States ===\nIn February 1938, Bonhoeffer made an initial contact with members of the [[German Resistance]] when his brother-in-law [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]] introduced him to a group seeking Hitler's overthrow at [[Abwehr]], the German military intelligence service.\n\nBonhoeffer also learned from Dohn\u00e1nyi that war was imminent and was particularly troubled by the prospect of being conscripted. As a committed pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and fight in his army, though not to do so was potentially a [[capital offense]]. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most Christians and their churches at the time.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\" />\n\nIt was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Amid much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]:\n{{quote|I have come to the conclusion that I made a mistake in coming to America. I must live through this difficult period in our national history with the people of Germany. I will have no right to participate in the reconstruction of Christian life in Germany after the war if I do not share the trials of this time with my people&nbsp;... Christians in Germany will have to face the terrible alternative of either willing the defeat of their nation in order that [[Christian civilization]] may survive or willing the victory of their nation and thereby destroying civilization.

In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer joined the [[Abwehr]], a German military intelligence organization. Dohn\u00e1nyi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service.<ref name=nyrb /> Bonhoeffer presumably knew about [[Operation Spark (1940)|various 1943 plots]] against Hitler through Dohn\u00e1nyi, who was actively involved in the planning.<ref name=nyrb>{{cite news|title=The Tragedy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/25/tragedy-dietrich-bonhoeffer-and-hans-von-dohnanyi/ | accessdate =12 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=25 October 2012| first1 =Elisabeth | last1 = Sifton| first2=Fritz | last2 = Stern}}</ref> In the face of Nazi atrocities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that \"the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1997) ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' . New York: Touchstone. p. 7.</ref> He did not justify his action but accepted that he was taking guilt upon himself as he wrote, \"When a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', p. 244</ref> (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said, \"The blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness.\"<ref>Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', 1975, p. 155</ref>)\n\nUnder cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the Western Allies in hope of garnering their support, and, through his ecumenical contacts abroad, to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. His visits to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland were camouflaged as legitimate intelligence activities for the Abwehr. In May 1942, he met Anglican [[Bishop George Bell]] of Chichester, a member of the [[House of Lords]] and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer's exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British foreign minister [[Sir Anthony Eden|Anthony Eden]]. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance.<ref>Slack, \"George Bell\", SCM, 1971, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Dohn\u00e1nyi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time Bonhoeffer worked on ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'' and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended ''Ethics'' as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943, Bonhoeffer and Dohn\u00e1nyi were arrested and imprisoned.\n\n=== Imprisonment ===\nOn 13 January 1943, Bonhoeffer had become engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=289|via=}}</ref> A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18.

Once he was in prison, however, Maria's status as fianc\u00e9e became invaluable, as it meant she could visit Bonhoeffer and correspond with him. While their relationship was troubled,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, OR|pages=380|via=}}</ref> she was a source of food and smuggled messages.<ref>{{Cite book|title=No Ordinary Men|last=Sifton|first=Elisabeth|publisher=New York Review Book|year=2013|isbn=978-1-59017-681-8|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/noordinarymendie0000sift/page/55 55]|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/noordinarymendie0000sift/page/55}}</ref> Bonhoeffer made [[Eberhard Bethge]] his heir, but Maria, in allowing her correspondence with Bonhoeffer to be published after her death, provided an invaluable addition to the scholarship.\n\nFor a year and a half, Bonhoeffer was imprisoned at [[Tegel]] military prison awaiting trial. There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to [[Eberhard Bethge]] and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in ''Letters and Papers from Prison''. One of those guards, a corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and \"disappear\" with him, and plans were made for that end. But Bonhoeffer declined it, fearing Nazi retribution against his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi, who were also imprisoned.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bonhoeffer,  Dietrich & Kelly, Geffrey B. (Editor)|title=A Testament to Freedom|page=43}}</ref>\n\nAfter the failure of the [[20 July Plot]] on Hitler's life in 1944 and the discovery in September 1944 of secret Abwehr documents relating to the conspiracy, Bonhoeffer was accused of association with the conspirators. He was transferred from the military prison Tegel in Berlin, where he had been held for 18 months, to the detention cellar of the house prison of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Security Head Office]], the Gestapo's high-security prison. In February 1945, he was secretly moved to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], and finally to [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]].\n\nOn 4 April 1945, the diaries of [[Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], head of the Abwehr, were discovered, and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that the Abwehr conspirators be destroyed.<ref name=PlottingHitler>{{cite book|year=1994|author=[[Joachim Fest|Fest, Joachim]]|isbn=978-0-297-81774-1|title=Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933\u20131945|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|title-link=Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933\u20131945}}</ref> Bonhoeffer was led away just as he concluded his final Sunday service and asked an English prisoner, [[Sigismund Payne Best|Payne Best]], to remember him to Bishop George Bell of Chichester if he should ever reach his home: \"This is the end\u2014for me the beginning of life.\"<ref name=\"Eberhard Bethge p 927\">{{cite book|author=Bethge, Eberhard |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography|page=927}}</ref>\n\n=== Execution ===\n[[File:Flossenb\u00fcrg April 9 1945 Memorial.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp, Arrestblock-Hof: Memorial to members of German resistance executed on 9 April 1945]]\nBonhoeffer was condemned to death on 8 April 1945 by SS judge [[Otto Thorbeck]] at a [[drumhead court-martial]] without witnesses, records of proceedings or a defense in [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]].<ref name=GermanResistance>{{cite book|year=1996|author=Peter Hoffman|isbn=978-0-7735-1531-4|title=The History of the German Resistance, 1933\u20131945|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press}}</ref> He was executed there by [[hanging]] at dawn on 9 April 1945, just two weeks before soldiers from the United States [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th]] and [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Infantry Divisions]] liberated the camp,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.97thdivision.com/flossenberg4.html|title=Flossenberg|work=97thdivision.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.97thid.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?show&flos&line=Flossenburg+Concentration+Camp&f=97thid/flossenburg&dpt=9&id=12817776922&cr=1 |title=Memories of the chaplain to the US 97th Infantry Division at the online Museum of the division in WWII |date=29 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215749/http://www.97thid.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?show&flos&line=Flossenburg+Concentration+Camp&f=97thid%2Fflossenburg&dpt=9&id=12817776922&cr=1 |archivedate=3 March 2016  }}</ref> three weeks before the Soviet capture of Berlin and a month before the surrender of Nazi Germany.\n\nBonhoeffer was stripped of his clothing and led naked into the execution yard where he was hanged, along with fellow conspirators Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], Canaris's deputy General [[Hans Oster]], military jurist General [[Karl Sack]], General [[Friedrich von Rabenau]],<ref>Wistrich, Robert (1995).

''  citation by Dietrich Bonhoeffer|alt=]]\n\nOvershadowed by the dramatic events of his life, Bonhoeffer's theology has nevertheless been influential. His theology has a fragmentary, unsystematic nature, due at least in part to his untimely death, and is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation and projection. So, for example, while his [[Christocentric]] approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, his commitment to justice and ideas about \"religionless Christianity\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://intersecting.weebly.com/blog/nones-dones-and-religionless-christianity-part-1 | title=Nones, Dones and Religionless Christianity, Part 1}}</ref> are emphasized by liberal Protestants.\n\nCentral to Bonhoeffer's theology is Christ, in whom God and the world are reconciled. Bonhoeffer's God is a suffering God, whose manifestation is found in this-worldliness. Bonhoeffer believed that the [[Incarnation]] of God in flesh made it unacceptable to speak of God and the world \"in terms of two spheres\"\u2014an implicit attack upon Luther's [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. Bonhoeffer stressed personal and collective piety and revived the idea of [[imitation of Christ]]. He argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.<ref>Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', p. 835</ref> Bonhoeffer insisted that the church, like the Christians, \"had to share in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world\" if it were to be a true church of Christ.\n\nIn his prison letters, Bonhoeffer raised tantalizing questions about the role of Christianity and the church in a \"world come of age,\" where human beings no longer need a metaphysical God as a stop-gap to human limitations; and mused about the emergence of a \"religionless Christianity,\" where God would be unclouded from metaphysical constructs of the previous 1900 years. Influenced by Barth's distinction between faith and religion, Bonhoeffer had a critical view of the phenomenon of religion and asserted that revelation abolished religion, which he called the \"garment\" of faith. Having witnessed the complete failure of the German Protestant church as an institution in the face of Nazism, he saw this challenge as an opportunity of renewal for Christianity.\n\nYears after Bonhoeffer's death, some Protestant thinkers developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the \"[[Death of God theology|Death of God]]\" movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics\u2014such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and others\u2014have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer's insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretation is more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the [[neo-orthodox]] school to which he belonged.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bonhoeffer also influenced [[Daniel Comboni|Comboni]] missionary Father [[Ezechiele Ramin]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.giovaniemissione.it/categoria-testimoni/2174/ezechiele-ramin/#biografia\n|title=La vita di Lele\n|language=it\n|publisher=Giovani e Missione\n|date=\n|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=Cori>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032001/http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 22 March 2012\n |title      = Ezechiele Ramin\n |language   = it\n |author     = Piera Cori\n |publisher  = Alla Tua Presenza\n |date       = 13 July 2010\n |accessdate = 31 March 2011\n}}</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nEnglish translations of Bonhoeffer's works, most of which were originally written in German, are available.

Bonhoeffer's dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as ''Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche''. In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and [[collective guilt]], it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.\n* ''Act and Being.

Bonhoeffer's second dissertation, written in 1929\u20131930 and published in 1931 as ''Akt und Sein'', deals with the consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the Reformation's insight into the origin sinfulness in the \"heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor.\" Bonhoeffer's thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology are explained.\n* ''Creation and Fall.

''Life Together'' is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer's meditation on the nature of Christian community. ''Prayerbook of the Bible'' is a classic meditation on the importance of the Psalms for ''Christian prayer''.

Writing fiction\u2014an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story\u2014occupied much of Bonhoeffer's first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fianc\u00e9e and dealing with his interrogation. \"There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,\" he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer's family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer's participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison.

Critical edition published under its original title ''Discipleship'': John D. Godsey (editor); Geffrey B. Kelly (editor). Fortress Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8006-8324-2}}. Bonhoeffer's most widely read book begins, \"Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace.\" That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church. First published in 1937 as ''Nachfolge'' (Discipleship), it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: what Jesus demanded of his followers\u2014and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.\n* ''Life Together''. The stimulus for the writing of ''[[Life Together]]'' was the closing of the preachers' seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer's thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the \"Brother's House\" there. ''Life Together'' was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as ''Gemeinsames Leben'', and first translated into English in 1954.

This is the culmination of Bonhoeffer's theological and personal odyssey, even though the book was not completed and was not the ''Ethics'' which Bonhoeffer intended to have published. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' (Edited originally by Eberhard Bethge; first English translation 1953 by SCM Press).

In addition to his other siblings, Dietrich had a twin sister, [[Bonhoeffer family|Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz]]:  he and Sabine were the sixth and seventh children out of eight. His father was [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]] [[Karl Bonhoeffer]], noted for his criticism of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and his mother Paula Bonhoeffer, n\u00e9e von Hase, was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian [[Karl Hase|Karl von Hase]] and painter [[Stanislaus von  Kalckreuth]]. Bonhoeffer's family dynamic and his parents values enabled him to receive a high level of education and also encouraged his curiosity, which in turn impacted his ability to lead others around him, specifically in the church setting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Forged In Crisis: The Making of Five Courageous Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2003|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=New York, NY|pages=287}}</ref> His oldest brother [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] became a chemist, and, along with [[Paul Harteck]], discovered the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] in 1929. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during World War I, when the twins were 12. The third Bonhoeffer child, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer|Klaus]], was a lawyer until he was executed for his involvement in the [[20 July plot]].{{sfn | Bonhoeffer | Barnett | Schulz | 2011 | p=581}}{{sfn | Bethge | Barnett | 1999 | p=18,625}}{{sfn | Root | 2014 | p=119}} \n\nBoth of Bonhoeffer's older sisters, [[Bonhoeffer family|Ursula Bonhoeffer Schleicher and Christel Bonhoeffer von Dohnanyi]], married men who were eventually executed by the Nazis. Christel was imprisoned by the Nazis but survived. Sabine and their youngest sister Susanne Bonhoeffer Dress each married men who survived Nazism. His cousin [[Karl-G\u00fcnther von Hase]] was the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nBonhoeffer completed his ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', the equivalent of both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. He went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree (Dr. theol.) from [[Berlin University]] in 1927, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]''.\n\n=== Studies in America ===\nStill too young to be ordained, at the age of twenty-four Bonhoeffer went to the United States in 1930 for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study and a teaching fellowship at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. Although Bonhoeffer found the American seminary not up to his exacting German standards (\"There is no theology here.\"),<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\">David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 45</ref> he had life-changing experiences and friendships. He studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and met Frank Fisher, a black fellow-seminarian who introduced him to [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], where Bonhoeffer taught [[Sunday school]] and formed a lifelong love for African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], a collection of which he took back to Germany. He heard [[Adam Clayton Powell Sr.]] preach the Gospel of Social Justice, and became sensitive to not only social injustices experienced by minorities, but also the ineptitude of the church to bring about integration.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html |work=PBS|title=Bonhoeffer Timeline}}</ref> \n\nBonhoeffer began to see things \"from below\"\u2014from the perspective of those who suffer oppression.

No ISBN.</ref>]]\n\nAfter returning to Germany in 1931, Bonhoeffer became a lecturer in [[systematic theology]] at the University of Berlin. Deeply interested in [[ecumenism]], he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the [[World Council of Churches]]) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone something of a personal conversion from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity to being a dedicated man of faith, resolved to carry out the teaching of Christ as he found it revealed in the Gospels.<ref name=\"Michael Balfour p216\">Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p. 216</ref> On 15 November 1931\u2014at the age of 25\u2014he was ordained at [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|Old-Prussian United]] {{ill|St. Matthew, Berlin-Tiergarten|de|Matth\u00e4uskirche (Berlin-Tiergarten)|St. Matthew}} in Berlin-Tiergarten.\n\n=== Confessing Church ===\nBonhoeffer's promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically altered with the Nazi ascension to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the ''F\u00fchrer'' (leader), who could very well turn out to be ''Verf\u00fchrer'' (mis-leader, or seducer). He was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible.<ref>Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', pp. 259\u201360</ref> In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply \"bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam a spoke in the wheel itself.\"<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 38</ref>\n\nIn November 1932, two months before the Nazi takeover, there had been an election for [[presbyter]]s and [[synod]]als (church officials) of the German ''Landeskirche'' (Protestant historical established churches). This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic [[German Christian]] (Deutsche Christen) movement and Young Reformers\u2014a struggle which threatened to explode into [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials.\n\nDespite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming number of key church positions went to Nazi-supported Deutsche Christen people.<ref>Elizabeth Raum, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', p. 72</ref> The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|Westphalia]], and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Hanover]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The non-Nazi opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted \"intact churches,\" as opposed to the other so-called \"destroyed churches.\"\n\nIn opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict upon all pastoral services (baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.), but [[Karl Barth]] and others advised against such a radical proposal.<ref>{{Citation |date=June 2007 | contribution-url = http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2007/06/ten-theses-on-dietrich-bonhoeffer.html | title = Faith and Theology | contribution = Ten theses on Dietrich Bonhoeffer | publisher = [[Blogspot]]}}.</ref> In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and [[Hermann Sasse]] were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the [[Bethel Institution|Bethel Confession]],<ref name=\"Obendiek 1992 57\">Enno Obendiek, \u201eDie Theologische Erkl\u00e4rung von Barmen 1934: Hinf\u00fchrung\u201c, in: ''\u201e\u2026 den gro\u00dfen Zwecken des Christenthums gem\u00e4\u00df\u201c: Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992; Eine Handreichung f\u00fcr die Gemeinden'', Wilhelm H\u00fcffmeier (compilator) for the Kirchenkanzlei der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp.&nbsp;52\u201358 [57]. {{ISBN|3-7858-0346-X}}</ref> a new statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God's fidelity to Jews as His chosen people, the Bethel Confession was so watered down to make it more palatable that Bonhoeffer ultimately refused to sign it.<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p. 47</ref>\n\nIn September 1933, the national church synod at [[Wittenberg]] voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the [[Aryan paragraph]] within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of [[baptism]], [[Martin Niem\u00f6ller]] founded the ''[[Pfarrernotbund]]'' (Pastors' Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the [[Old Testament]] from the Bible, which was seen by many as [[heresy]], further swelling the ranks of the Emergency League.<ref>Robert P.

He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, \"I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: 'And what of the German Church?'\" Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his \"splendid theological armory\" while \"the house of your church is on fire,\" and chided him to return to Berlin \"by the next ship.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: London 1933\u20131935'', p. 40</ref>\n\nBonhoeffer, however, did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home; he hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niem\u00f6ller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with the Christian gospel. When Bishop {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Heckel|de}}\u2014the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs\u2014traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom,'' ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p. 19</ref>\n\n=== Underground seminaries ===\nIn 1935, Bonhoeffer was offered a well-sought-after opportunity to study non-violent resistance under [[Gandhi]] in his [[ashram]]. However, remembering Barth's rebuke, Bonhoeffer decided to return to Germany instead, where he was the head at an underground seminary in [[Szczecin-Zdroje|Finkenwalde]] for training Confessing Church pastors.  As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to Switzerland in 1935; Niem\u00f6ller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer's authorization to teach at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was revoked after he was denounced as a \"[[pacifist]] and enemy of the state\" by Theodor Heckel.[[File:Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Skulptur an der Hauptkirche Sankt Petri (Hamburg).JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], Hamburg]]Bonhoeffer's efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds. He found a great benefactor in [[Ruth von Kleist-Retzow]]. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer's former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter, [[Maria von Wedemeyer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/februaryweb-only/33.0a.html|title=Bonhoeffer in Love|author=Wendy Murray Zoba|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest. By August 1937, [[Himmler]] decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the Gestapo closed the seminary at Finkenwalde, and by November arrested 27 pastors and former students. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]],'' a study on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which he not only attacked \"cheap grace\" as a cover for ethical laxity, but also preached \"costly grace.\"\n\nBonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct \"seminary on the run\" supervision of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian [[Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania]]. The [[von Blumenthal]] family hosted the seminary on its estate of [[S\u0142onowice, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz]]. The pastors of Gro\u00df Schl\u00f6nwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later edited Bonhoeffer's ''Letters and Papers from Prison'') as vicars in their congregations.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\">''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsst\u00e4tte Bonhoeffer Haus, 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1938, the Gestapo banned Bonhoeffer from Berlin. In summer 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate ([[Folwark|Vorwerk]]) of the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Tychowo, S\u0142awno County|Wendish Tychow]]. In March 1940, the Gestapo shut down the seminary there following the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\" /> Bonhoeffer's monastic communal life and teaching at Finkenwalde seminary formed the basis of his books, ''The Cost of Discipleship'' and ''Life Together.''\n\nBonhoeffer's sister, Sabine, along with her Jewish-classified husband Gerhard Leibholz and their two daughters, escaped to England by way of Switzerland in September 1940.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html | publisher = PBS | title = Bonhoeffer | contribution = Timeline}}.</ref>\n\n=== Return to the United States ===\nIn February 1938, Bonhoeffer made an initial contact with members of the [[German Resistance]] when his brother-in-law [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]] introduced him to a group seeking Hitler's overthrow at [[Abwehr]], the German military intelligence service.\n\nBonhoeffer also learned from Dohn\u00e1nyi that war was imminent and was particularly troubled by the prospect of being conscripted. As a committed pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and fight in his army, though not to do so was potentially a [[capital offense]]. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most Christians and their churches at the time.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p. 19\" />\n\nIt was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Amid much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]:\n{{quote|I have come to the conclusion that I made a mistake in coming to America.

In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer joined the [[Abwehr]], a German military intelligence organization. Dohn\u00e1nyi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service.<ref name=nyrb /> Bonhoeffer presumably knew about [[Operation Spark (1940)|various 1943 plots]] against Hitler through Dohn\u00e1nyi, who was actively involved in the planning.<ref name=nyrb>{{cite news|title=The Tragedy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/25/tragedy-dietrich-bonhoeffer-and-hans-von-dohnanyi/ | accessdate =12 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=25 October 2012| first1 =Elisabeth | last1 = Sifton| first2=Fritz | last2 = Stern}}</ref> In the face of Nazi atrocities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that \"the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1997) ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' . New York: Touchstone. p. 7.</ref> He did not justify his action but accepted that he was taking guilt upon himself as he wrote, \"When a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', p. 244</ref> (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said, \"The blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness.\"<ref>Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', 1975, p. 155</ref>)\n\nUnder cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the Western Allies in hope of garnering their support, and, through his ecumenical contacts abroad, to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. His visits to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland were camouflaged as legitimate intelligence activities for the Abwehr. In May 1942, he met Anglican [[Bishop George Bell]] of Chichester, a member of the [[House of Lords]] and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer's exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British foreign minister [[Sir Anthony Eden|Anthony Eden]]. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance.<ref>Slack, \"George Bell\", SCM, 1971, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Dohn\u00e1nyi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time Bonhoeffer worked on ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'' and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended ''Ethics'' as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943, Bonhoeffer and Dohn\u00e1nyi were arrested and imprisoned.\n\n=== Imprisonment ===\nOn 13 January 1943, Bonhoeffer had become engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-0656-3|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=289|via=}}</ref> A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18.

There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to [[Eberhard Bethge]] and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in ''Letters and Papers from Prison''. One of those guards, a corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and \"disappear\" with him, and plans were made for that end. But Bonhoeffer declined it, fearing Nazi retribution against his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi, who were also imprisoned.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bonhoeffer,  Dietrich & Kelly, Geffrey B.

''  citation by Dietrich Bonhoeffer|alt=]]\n\nOvershadowed by the dramatic events of his life, Bonhoeffer's theology has nevertheless been influential. His theology has a fragmentary, unsystematic nature, due at least in part to his untimely death, and is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation and projection. So, for example, while his [[Christocentric]] approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, his commitment to justice and ideas about \"religionless Christianity\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://intersecting.weebly.com/blog/nones-dones-and-religionless-christianity-part-1 | title=Nones, Dones and Religionless Christianity, Part 1}}</ref> are emphasized by liberal Protestants.\n\nCentral to Bonhoeffer's theology is Christ, in whom God and the world are reconciled. Bonhoeffer's God is a suffering God, whose manifestation is found in this-worldliness. Bonhoeffer believed that the [[Incarnation]] of God in flesh made it unacceptable to speak of God and the world \"in terms of two spheres\"\u2014an implicit attack upon Luther's [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. Bonhoeffer stressed personal and collective piety and revived the idea of [[imitation of Christ]]. He argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.<ref>Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', p. 835</ref> Bonhoeffer insisted that the church, like the Christians, \"had to share in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world\" if it were to be a true church of Christ.\n\nIn his prison letters, Bonhoeffer raised tantalizing questions about the role of Christianity and the church in a \"world come of age,\" where human beings no longer need a metaphysical God as a stop-gap to human limitations; and mused about the emergence of a \"religionless Christianity,\" where God would be unclouded from metaphysical constructs of the previous 1900 years. Influenced by Barth's distinction between faith and religion, Bonhoeffer had a critical view of the phenomenon of religion and asserted that revelation abolished religion, which he called the \"garment\" of faith. Having witnessed the complete failure of the German Protestant church as an institution in the face of Nazism, he saw this challenge as an opportunity of renewal for Christianity.\n\nYears after Bonhoeffer's death, some Protestant thinkers developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the \"[[Death of God theology|Death of God]]\" movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics\u2014such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and others\u2014have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer's insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretation is more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the [[neo-orthodox]] school to which he belonged.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Bonhoeffer also influenced [[Daniel Comboni|Comboni]] missionary Father [[Ezechiele Ramin]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.giovaniemissione.it/categoria-testimoni/2174/ezechiele-ramin/#biografia\n|title=La vita di Lele\n|language=it\n|publisher=Giovani e Missione\n|date=\n|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=Cori>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032001/http://www.pieracori.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307:ezechiele-ramin&catid=77:testimoni&Itemid=90\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 22 March 2012\n |title      = Ezechiele Ramin\n |language   = it\n |author     = Piera Cori\n |publisher  = Alla Tua Presenza\n |date       = 13 July 2010\n |accessdate = 31 March 2011\n}}</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nEnglish translations of Bonhoeffer's works, most of which were originally written in German, are available.

Bonhoeffer's dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as ''Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche''. In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and [[collective guilt]], it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.\n* ''Act and Being.

Bonhoeffer's second dissertation, written in 1929\u20131930 and published in 1931 as ''Akt und Sein'', deals with the consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the Reformation's insight into the origin sinfulness in the \"heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor.\" Bonhoeffer's thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology are explained.\n* ''Creation and Fall.

''Life Together'' is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer's meditation on the nature of Christian community.

Writing fiction\u2014an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story\u2014occupied much of Bonhoeffer's first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fianc\u00e9e and dealing with his interrogation. \"There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,\" he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer's family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer's participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison.

First published in 1937 as ''Nachfolge'' (Discipleship), it soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: what Jesus demanded of his followers\u2014and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.\n* ''Life Together''. The stimulus for the writing of ''[[Life Together]]'' was the closing of the preachers' seminary at Finkenwalde. The treatise contains Bonhoeffer's thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the \"Brother's House\" there. ''Life Together'' was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as ''Gemeinsames Leben'', and first translated into English in 1954. Harper San Francisco 1978 paperback: {{ISBN|0-06-060852-8}}\n* ''Ethics'' (1955 in English by SCM Press). Touchstone edition, 1995 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-81501-X}}. This is the culmination of Bonhoeffer's theological and personal odyssey, even though the book was not completed and was not the ''Ethics'' which Bonhoeffer intended to have published. Based on careful reconstruction of the manuscripts, freshly and expertly translated and annotated, the critical edition features an insightful introduction by Clifford Green and an afterword from the German edition's editors. Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' (Edited originally by Eberhard Bethge; first English translation 1953 by SCM Press). This edition translated by [[Reginald H. Fuller]] and Frank Clark from ''Widerstand und Ergebung: Briefe und Aufzeichnungen aus der Haft''. Munich: Christian Kaiser Verlag (1970). Touchstone 1997 paperback: {{ISBN|0-684-83827-3}}. In hundreds of letters, including letters written to his fianc\u00e9e, Maria von Wedemeyer (selected from the complete correspondence, previously published as ''Love Letters from Cell 92'' Ruth-Alice von Bismarck and Ulrich Kabitz (editors), Abingdon Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-687-01098-5}}), as well as official documents, short original pieces, and a few final sermons, the volume sheds light on Bonhoeffer's active resistance to and increasing involvement in the conspiracy against the Hitler regime; his arrest; and his long imprisonment. Finally, Bonhoeffer's many exchanges with his family, fianc\u00e9e, and closest friends, demonstrate the affection and solidarity that accompanied Bonhoeffer to his prison cell, concentration camp, and eventual death.\n* ''A Testament to Freedom: The Essential Writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer'' (1990).
