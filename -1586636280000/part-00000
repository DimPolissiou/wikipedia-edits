After its military pact with the United States in the 1950s, it intensively studied guerrilla warfare through engagement with the US military. In 1965, it decided that the conditions were ripe for a successful guerilla war in Kashmir. Code named '[[Operation Gibraltar]]',  companies were dispatched into Indian-administered Kashmir, the majority of whose members were ''razakars'' (volunteers) and ''mujahideen'' recruited from Pakistan-administered Kashmir and trained by the Army. These irregular forces were supported by officers and men from the paramilitary [[Northern Light Infantry]] and [[Azad Kashmir Regiment|Azad Kashmir Rifles]] as well as commandos from the [[Special Services Group]]. About 30,000 infiltrators are estimated to have been dispatched in August 1965 as part of the 'Operation Gibraltar'.{{sfn|Fair, Militant Challenge in Pakistan|2011|pp=109\u2013111}}\n\nThe plan was for the infiltrators to mingle with the local populace and incite them to rebellion.

India was ready to return them in exchange for a \"durable solution\" to the Kashmir issue. Diplomat [[J. N. Dixit]] states that the negotiations at Simla were painful and tortuous, and almost broke down. The deadlock was broken in a personal meeting between the Prime Ministers [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Indira Gandhi]], where Bhutto acknowledged that the Kashmir issue should be finally resolved and removed as a hurdle in India-Pakistan relations; that the cease-fire line, to be renamed the [[Line of Control]], could be gradually converted into a ''de jure'' border between India and Pakistan; and that he would take steps to integrate the Pakistani-controlled portions of Jammu and Kashmir into the federal territories of Pakistan.{{sfn|Dixit, India-Pakistan in War and Peace|2003|pp=228\u2013229}} However, he requested that the formal declaration of the Agreement should not include a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute as it would endanger his fledgling civilian government and bring in military and other hardline elements into power in Pakistan.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dixit, India-Pakistan in War and Peace|2003|pp=228\u2013229}}; {{harvtxt|Haqqani, Pakistan Between Mosque and Military|2010|pp=98\u201399}}; {{harvtxt|Subramaniam, India's Wars|2016|loc=Chapter 27}}; {{harvtxt|Ganguly, Crisis in Kashmir|1999|pp=60\u201363}}</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the [[Simla Agreement]] was formulated and signed by the two countries, whereby the countries resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations and to maintain the sanctity of the Line of Control.

Both countries subsequently made claims to Kashmir, based on the history and religious affiliations of the Kashmiri people. The [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], which lies strategically in the north-west of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan and China, was formerly ruled by Maharaja [[Hari Singh]] under the [[paramountcy]] of [[British Raj|British India]]. In geographical and legal terms, the Maharaja could have joined either of the two new countries. Although urged by the Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], to determine the future of his state before the transfer of power took place, Singh demurred. In October 1947, incursions by Pakistan took place leading to a [[1947 war|war]], as a result of which the state of Jammu and Kashmir remains divided between India and Pakistan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The latter includes a narrow strip of land called [[Azad Kashmir]] and the Northern Areas, comprising the [[Gilgit Agency]], [[Baltistan]], and the former kingdoms of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]]. Attempts to resolve the dispute through political discussions have been unsuccessful. In September 1965, [[1965 war|war]] again broke out between Pakistan and India. The United Nations called for another cease-fire, and peace was restored following the [[Tashkent Declaration]] in 1966, by which both nations returned to their original positions along the demarcated line. After the [[Indo-Pak War of 1971|1971 war]] and the creation of independent [[Bangladesh]] under the terms of the 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] between Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] of India and [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] of Pakistan, it was agreed that neither country would seek to alter the cease-fire line in Kashmir, which was renamed as the Line of Control, \"unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations\".\n\nNumerous violations of the Line of Control have occurred, including incursions by insurgents and Pakistani armed forces at Kargil leading to the [[Kargil war]]. There have also been sporadic clashes on the [[Siachen Glacier]], where the Line of Control is not demarcated and both countries maintain forces at altitudes rising to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, with the Indian forces serving at higher altitudes.\n\n===Indian view===\n[[File:Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh (1895 - 1961).jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] in October 1947 under which he acceded the [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|State of Jammu and Kashmir]] to the Union of India.]]\nIndia has officially stated that it believes Kashmir to be an integral part of India, though the then Prime Minister of India, [[Manmohan Singh]], stated after the [[2010 Kashmir Unrest]] that his government was willing to grant autonomy to the region within the purview of Indian constitution if there was consensus among political parties on this issue.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/bjp-challenges-pm-on-kashmir-autonomy-issue/ |title=PM MMS on Kashmir autonomy issue |last= |first= |date= |newspaper=|access-date= |work= |via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-11/india/28297162_1_autonomy-jammu-and-kashmir-bjp-questions | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712071508/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-11/india/28297162_1_autonomy-jammu-and-kashmir-bjp-questions | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 July 2012 |work=The Times of India |title=BJP questions PM's Kashmir autonomy remark |date=11 August 2010}}</ref> The Indian viewpoint is succinctly summarised by [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External affairs]], Government of India<ref name=meaindweb>{{cite web |url=http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/kashmirissue.htm |title=Ministry of External Affairs, India&nbsp;\u2013 Kashmir Issue |publisher=Meaindia.nic.in |accessdate=2 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616161619/http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/kashmirissue.htm |archivedate=16 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=meaindpdf>{{cite web |url=http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/19jk01.pdf |title=Kashmir: The true story, Ministry of External Affairs, India |accessdate=2 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106084737/http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/19jk01.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2007}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014\n* India holds that the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the [[Union of India]], signed by Maharaja Hari Singh (erstwhile ruler of the State) on 25 October 1947<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/freedom/0710jha2.htm |title=Excerpted from Kashmir 1947, Rival Versions of History, by Prem Shankar Jha, Oxford University Press, 1996 \u2013 An interview of Sam Manekshaw, the first field marshal in the Indian army, then chosen to accompany V P Menon on his historic mission to Kashmir. |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Chief Justice JSAnand\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jun/01jk.htm|title=Rediff On The NeT Special: The Real Kashmir Story|website=www.rediff.com}}</ref> and executed on 27 October 1947<ref name=\"Chief Justice JSAnand\"/> between the ruler of Kashmir and the Governor General of India was a legal act and completely valid in terms of the Government of India Act (1935), Indian Independence Act (1947) as well as under international law and as such was total and irrevocable.<ref name=meaindpdf/>\n* The [[Constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] had unanimously ratified the Maharaja's Instrument of Accession to India and adopted a constitution for the state that called for a perpetual merger of Jammu and Kashmir with the Union of India.

According to Bose, the Kashmiri Muslims had higher expectations from India which turned out to be a \"moderately successful\" democracy and it was in this context that Kashmiri Muslim rage spilled over after the rigging of the elections in 1987.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC |title=Kashmir: ROOTS OF CONFLICT, PATHS TO PEACE |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |isbn= 9780674028555|location= |pages=99\u2013100|date=June 2009 }}</ref> The residents of Azad Kashmir are also mostly Punjabi, differing in ethnicity from Kashmiris in the Indian administered section of the state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEqRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA153#v=onepage |title=The Territorial Management of Ethnic Conflict |date=2 August 2004 |publisher=Routledge |pages=153 |last1=Coakley |first1=John|isbn=9781135764425 }}</ref>\n\n====Gilgit-Baltistan====\nThe main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is constitutional status for the region as a fifth province of Pakistan.<ref name = indian_express>{{cite web |author=Nadeem |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gilgitbaltistan-a-question-of-autonomy/519428/1 |title=Gilgit-Baltistan: A question of autonomy |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name = gilgit_polls /> However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to the 1948 UN resolution.<ref name=gilgit_polls>{{cite news |last=Shigri |first=Manzar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AB1ZE20091112 |title=Pakistan's disputed Northern Areas go to polls |agency=Reuters |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=dawn_gilgit>{{cite web |url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |title=DAWN: Gilgit-Baltistan autonomy |work=Dawn |location=Pakistan |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035500/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |archivedate=1 June 2012|date=9 September 2009 }}</ref> In 2007, the [[International Crisis Group]] stated that \"Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream.

Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that they would be willing to accept alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the \"Chenab\" formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other side{{mdash}}effectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the [[Valley of Kashmir]], a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including [[Sajjad Lone]], have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the [[Kargil War]] and the subsequent [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks.

Since the Constituent Assembly did not make such a recommendation before its dissolution in 1957, the Article 370 has taken on the features of a \"permanent provision\" despite being titled a temporary provision in the Constitution.<ref>[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/j-k-high-court-says-article-370-is-permanent-cant-be-abrogated-repealed-or-amended/ Art 370 permanent\u2026cannot be repealed or amended: HC], The Indian Express, 12 October 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-importance-of-article-370/article7762192.ece The importance of Article 370], The Hindu, 15 October 2015.</ref>\n* [[Article 370]] has emerged as the biggest obstacle in front of plebiscite because of its complex procedure of amendment and opposition from the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com2\"/>\n* Article 370 allows its own death by permitting plebiscite. Article 370 was drafted while negotiations with Pakistan were still on. When Pakistan objected to Article 370 at the UN Commission Girija Shankar Bajpai, who was secretary general of Ministry of External Affairs, wrote to UNCIP in 1949 that Article 370 did not preclude plebiscite. Krishna Menon said to the UN Security Council in 1957 that if people of Kashmir voted to not stay with India then India's duty at that time would be to adopt those constitutional procedures which would enable separation of Kashmir from India. That procedure is contained in clause 3 of Article 370, a presidential order to declare that the Article 370 will cease to be operative.<ref name=\":3\">Noorani, A.

The Raja of Jammu [[Gulab Singh]], who was a vassal of the [[Sikh Empire]] and an influential noble in the Sikh court, sent expeditions to various border kingdoms and ended up encircling Kashmir by 1840.  Following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845{{ndash}}1846), Kashmir was ceded under the [[Treaty of Lahore]] to the [[East India Company]], which transferred it to Gulab Singh through the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]], in return for the payment of indemnity owed by the Sikh empire. Gulab Singh took the title of the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]. From then until the 1947 [[partition of India]], Kashmir was ruled by the Maharajas of the [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]].

Others fled to West Pakistan, some of whom made their way to the western districts of Poonch and Mirpur, which were [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|undergoing rebellion]].

Amanullah Khan moved to England and there NLF was renamed [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF).\n\nShortly after 1965 war, Kashmiri Pandit activist and writer, Prem Nath Bazaz wrote that the overwhelming majority of Kashmir's Muslims were unfriendly to India and wanted to get rid of the political setup, but did not want to use violence for this purpose.

Critics of Sheikh hold the view that he gave up the cherished goal of plebiscite for gaining Chief Minister's chair. He started talks with the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] for normalizing the situation in the region and came to an accord with her, called [[1974 Indira-Sheikh accord|1975 Indira-Sheikh accord]], by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in lieu of the people being given the right to self-rule by a democratically elected Government (as envisaged under [[article 370 of the Constitution of India]]), rather than the \"puppet government\" which is said to have ruled the state until then.<ref name=\":626\">{{Cite book |title=Abdullah, Sheikh; Taing, M.

On the other hand, Farooq Abdullah allied with the [[Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq|Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammed Farooq]] for the elections and charged that the state's autonomy had been eroded by successive Congress Party governments. The strategies yielded dividends and the Congress won 26 seats, while the NC secured 46.

Both countries subsequently made claims to Kashmir, based on the history and religious affiliations of the Kashmiri people. The [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], which lies strategically in the north-west of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan and China, was formerly ruled by Maharaja [[Hari Singh]] under the [[paramountcy]] of [[British Raj|British India]]. In geographical and legal terms, the Maharaja could have joined either of the two new countries. Although urged by the Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], to determine the future of his state before the transfer of power took place, Singh demurred. In October 1947, incursions by Pakistan took place leading to a [[1947 war|war]], as a result of which the state of Jammu and Kashmir remains divided between India and Pakistan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Bose offers a number of possible explanations for this. Azad Kashmir's strong pro-Pakistan allegiances and a relatively smaller population are suggested as reasons. But Bose believes that a stronger explanation was that Pakistan had itself been a military-bureaucratic state for most of its history without stable democratic institutions. According to Bose, the Kashmiri Muslims had higher expectations from India which turned out to be a \"moderately successful\" democracy and it was in this context that Kashmiri Muslim rage spilled over after the rigging of the elections in 1987.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC |title=Kashmir: ROOTS OF CONFLICT, PATHS TO PEACE |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |isbn= 9780674028555|location= |pages=99\u2013100|date=June 2009 }}</ref> The residents of Azad Kashmir are also mostly Punjabi, differing in ethnicity from Kashmiris in the Indian administered section of the state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEqRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA153#v=onepage |title=The Territorial Management of Ethnic Conflict |date=2 August 2004 |publisher=Routledge |pages=153 |last1=Coakley |first1=John|isbn=9781135764425 }}</ref>\n\n====Gilgit-Baltistan====\nThe main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is constitutional status for the region as a fifth province of Pakistan.<ref name = indian_express>{{cite web |author=Nadeem |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gilgitbaltistan-a-question-of-autonomy/519428/1 |title=Gilgit-Baltistan: A question of autonomy |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name = gilgit_polls /> However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to the 1948 UN resolution.<ref name=gilgit_polls>{{cite news |last=Shigri |first=Manzar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AB1ZE20091112 |title=Pakistan's disputed Northern Areas go to polls |agency=Reuters |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=dawn_gilgit>{{cite web |url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |title=DAWN: Gilgit-Baltistan autonomy |work=Dawn |location=Pakistan |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035500/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |archivedate=1 June 2012|date=9 September 2009 }}</ref> In 2007, the [[International Crisis Group]] stated that \"Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream.

Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that they would be willing to accept alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the \"Chenab\" formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other side{{mdash}}effectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the [[Valley of Kashmir]], a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including [[Sajjad Lone]], have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the [[Kargil War]] and the subsequent [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks.

This part of Upton-cum-Chalvey [[civil parishes in England|Civil Parish]] became [[List of sanitary districts in Buckinghamshire#Slough USD|Slough Urban Sanitary District]] in 1875. The functions of these two bodies were strengthened [[Local Government Act 1894|in 1894]], when [[Slough Urban District]] was created, [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] having been created in the previous decade. In 1930, there was a major extension westward of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]], and the area was divided into electoral wards for the first time (the new areas of Burnham (Beeches), Farnham (Royal) and Stoke (Poges) (commonly used suffixes) as well as the divisions of the old district Central, [[Chalvey]], [[Langley, Slough|Langley]] and [[Upton, Berkshire|Upton]]). In 1938, the town became a [[Municipal Borough]] by [[Royal Charter]].\n\nSlough was transferred to Berkshire in the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 local government reorganisation]]. The old Municipal Borough was abolished and not deemed part of an urban conglomeration, replaced by a non-city type second-tier authority ([[Non-metropolitan district]]), which was however made a Borough by the town's second Royal Charter. [[Britwell]] and [[Wexham Court]] became part of Slough at this time, with their civil [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]]. On 1 April 1995, the Borough of Slough expanded slightly into [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Surrey]], to take in [[Colnbrook]] and [[Poyle]] and merged their civil parish councils.\n\nSlough became a [[unitary authority]], on 1 April 1998. This coincided with the abolition of [[Berkshire County Council]] and the dissolution of its [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough Status]] received under its second Royal Charter. However, to enable the continued use of the word Borough, as in some other parts of Berkshire, Slough received its third Royal Charter in 1998.\n\nSince 2015, Slough has had a Youth Parliament to represent the views of younger people.\n\n===Town twinning===\nSlough is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|FRA}} '''[[Montreuil-sur-Mer|Montreuil]]''', France ''(since 1988)''<ref name=\"Archant twinning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns|title=British towns twinned with French towns|accessdate = 11 July 2013|work=Archant Community Media Ltd}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Red White Blue Slough.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Slough Trading Estate played a major part in making Slough an important business centre in South East England.]]\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Tesco Extra slough, Wellington Street.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Tesco]] Extra store, one of the largest in Europe\n|image2=Scottish & Southern Slough Power Station.jpg\n|caption2=The private power station for Slough Trading Estate.

The bricks for the building of [[Eton College]] were made in Slough. Later, as the Great West Road traffic increased, inns and pubs sprang up along the road to service the passing trade. Until the town developed as an industrial area, [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] were prominent in the local economy; the [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] apple was first raised in Colnbrook (not then within Slough) around 1825, and the [[dianthus]] \"Mrs Sinkins Pink\" was first raised at some point between 1868<ref>p20, ''The Changing Face of Slough'', Slough Museum, Breedon Books, Derby, 2003</ref> and 1883<ref>Fraser (1973), p. 100.</ref> by John Sinkins, the master of the [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] [[Poor Law Union|Union]] [[Workhouse]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plantprofile_pinks.shtml Plant profiles: Pinks, dianthus].

In 1847, he changed business and manufactured his [[:File:Ellimans-Universal-Embrocation-Slough-1897-Ad.png|''Elliman's Embrocation'']] and ''Royal Embrocation'' horse [[liniment]] at factories in Wellington Street and Chandos Street. Elliman became a major benefactor to the town, and is remembered today in the names of local roads and schools.\n\nIn September 1851, [[William Thomas Buckland]], an [[auctioneer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] from nearby [[Wraysbury]], began livestock sales in a field near the [[Slough railway station|''Great Western Road Railway Station'']] belonging to the ''North Star Inn''. Originally held on the first Tuesday of every month, the Cattle Market's popularity soon saw this increased to every Tuesday. A move to Wexham Street was necessitated by the postwar redevelopment of the town. The ''Slough Cattle Market'' was run by ''Messrs Buckland and Sons'' until its final closure in 1988.<ref>''The History of Buckland & Sons'' by Edward Barry Bowyer FRICS (1973).</ref>\n\nIn 1906, [[Horlicks|James Horlick]], one of the founders of the [[eponym]]ous [[malted milk]] company, opened a purpose-built red-brick factory near Slough Railway Station to manufacture his malted milk product. In 2015, the business was sold by Glaxo Smith Kline and in 2017, manufacturing at the site ceased altogether. The site is currently proposed to become residential making use of the original buildings as much as possible.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, [[Slough Estates Ltd]], the operator of the original [[Slough Trading Estate]], created and operated many more estates in the UK and abroad. The Slough Trading Estate meant that the town was largely insulated from many of the effects of [[recession]]. For many years, Slough's economy was mainly manufacturing-based.\n\nIn the last 20 or so years, there has been a major shift from a manufacturing to an information-based economy, with the closure of many factories (some of which had been in Slough for many decades). The factories are rapidly being replaced by office buildings. Hundreds of major companies have sited in Slough Trading Estate over the years, with its proximity to London [[Heathrow Airport]] and good motorway connections being attractive. In the 1960s, [[Gerry Anderson]]'s film company was based in Slough, and his [[Supermarionation]] series, including ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', were filmed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/15008144.Thunderbirds_return_to_their_Slough_home/|title=Thunderbirds return to their Slough home|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe UK headquarters of [[Mars, Incorporated]] is in Slough, the main factory having been established in 1932 by [[Forrest Mars Sr.]] and [[Frank C. Mars]]. It produced the [[Mars Bar]] in Slough over 70 years ago. One of the Mars factories has been demolished and some production has moved to the [[Czech Republic]]. The European head offices of major IT companies such as [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]], [[McAfee]], [[CA Technologies|Computer Associates]], [[PictureTel]] and Compusys (among others) are all in the town. [[O2 plc|O<sub>2</sub>]] is headquartered in the town across four buildings. The town is also home to the business support organisation [[Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce Group]] and [[National Foundation for Educational Research]], which is housed in the Mere.\n\nRecent new offices include those of [[Nintendo]], [[Black and Decker]] and [[Abbey business centres]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=502584 Location of registered office of Amazon.co.uk Ltd].

Until 1966, [[Citro\u00ebn]] assembled cars in a Liverpool Road factory (later used by ''Mars Confectionery''), and it retains its UK headquarters in the town. [[Ford of Britain|Ford]] built [[Ford D series|D Series]] and [[Ford Cargo|Cargo]] lorries at its factory in Langley (a former [[Hawker Aircraft]] site) from 1936 to the 1950s<ref>p120, ''The Changing Face of Slough'', Slough Museum, Breedon Books, Derby, 2003</ref>) until the site was redeveloped for housing in the 1990s.

Original villages that are now suburbs of Slough include [[Chalvey]], [[Cippenham]], [[Colnbrook]], [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], [[Poyle]], [[Upton, Slough|Upton]], and [[Wexham]].\n\nNamed neighbourhoods include Brands Hill, [[Britwell]], [[Huntercombe, Slough|Huntercombe]], Manor Park, [[Salt Hill]], Upton Lea and [[Windsor Meadows]]. The urban area merges into the neighbouring [[parishes]] of [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]], a small area of [[Taplow]] near [[Cippenham]], [[Farnham Royal]] and [[Stoke Poges]] which remain in the county of Buckinghamshire and [[Datchet]] which is also in Berkshire. [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] is narrowly [[buffer zone|buffered]] by the [[Jubilee River]] and by green space (mainly the college playing fields) from part of Slough, and the two areas formerly formed the Eton birth, marriages and deaths registration district.\n\n===Nearest places===\n{{Geographic location\n| title     = '''Nearest places'''\n| Centre    = Slough\n| North     = [[Farnham Royal]]\n| Northeast = [[Uxbridge]]\n| East      = [[West Drayton]]\n| Southeast = [[Heathrow Airport]]\n| South     = [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]]\n| Southwest = [[Dorney]]\n| West      = {{small|Across small parts of Burnham and [[Taplow]]}}<br>[[Maidenhead]]\n| Northwest = [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe nearest [[Met Office]] weather observing station to Slough is [[Heathrow Airport]], about {{convert|5|mi|0}} east of Slough town centre.

As returning to Poland (then in the [[Soviet Bloc]]) was not considered an option by many of the wartime refugees, many Polish families decided to settle in Slough. In time, a Polish-speaking [[Roman Catholic]] parish was established with its own church building. A new wave of Polish migration to Slough has followed since Poland became part of the [[European Union]].\n\nSlough Council elected the country's first black female mayor, [[Lydia Simmons]], in 1984.\n\nFigures from the 2011 census showed that 41.2% of Slough's population identified as Christian, 23.3% as Muslim, 10.6% as Sikh, 6.2% as Hindu, 0.5% as Buddhist, 0.1% as Jewish, 0.3% as having other religions, 12.1% as having no religion and 5.7% did not answer the question.

This part of Upton-cum-Chalvey [[civil parishes in England|Civil Parish]] became [[List of sanitary districts in Buckinghamshire#Slough USD|Slough Urban Sanitary District]] in 1875. The functions of these two bodies were strengthened [[Local Government Act 1894|in 1894]], when [[Slough Urban District]] was created, [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] having been created in the previous decade. In 1930, there was a major extension westward of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]], and the area was divided into electoral wards for the first time (the new areas of Burnham (Beeches), Farnham (Royal) and Stoke (Poges) (commonly used suffixes) as well as the divisions of the old district Central, [[Chalvey]], [[Langley, Slough|Langley]] and [[Upton, Berkshire|Upton]]). In 1938, the town became a [[Municipal Borough]] by [[Royal Charter]].\n\nSlough was transferred to Berkshire in the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 local government reorganisation]]. The old Municipal Borough was abolished and not deemed part of an urban conglomeration, replaced by a non-city type second-tier authority ([[Non-metropolitan district]]), which was however made a Borough by the town's second Royal Charter. [[Britwell]] and [[Wexham Court]] became part of Slough at this time, with their civil [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]]. On 1 April 1995, the Borough of Slough expanded slightly into [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Surrey]], to take in [[Colnbrook]] and [[Poyle]] and merged their civil parish councils.\n\nSlough became a [[unitary authority]], on 1 April 1998. This coincided with the abolition of [[Berkshire County Council]] and the dissolution of its [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough Status]] received under its second Royal Charter. However, to enable the continued use of the word Borough, as in some other parts of Berkshire, Slough received its third Royal Charter in 1998.\n\nSince 2015, Slough has had a Youth Parliament to represent the views of younger people.\n\n===Town twinning===\nSlough is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with:\n* {{flagicon|FRA}} '''[[Montreuil-sur-Mer|Montreuil]]''', France ''(since 1988)''<ref name=\"Archant twinning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns|title=British towns twinned with French towns|accessdate = 11 July 2013|work=Archant Community Media Ltd}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Red White Blue Slough.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Slough Trading Estate played a major part in making Slough an important business centre in South East England.]]\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Tesco Extra slough, Wellington Street.jpg\n|caption1=The [[Tesco]] Extra store, one of the largest in Europe\n|image2=Scottish & Southern Slough Power Station.jpg\n|caption2=The private power station for Slough Trading Estate.

The bricks for the building of [[Eton College]] were made in Slough. Later, as the Great West Road traffic increased, inns and pubs sprang up along the road to service the passing trade. Until the town developed as an industrial area, [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] were prominent in the local economy; the [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] apple was first raised in Colnbrook (not then within Slough) around 1825, and the [[dianthus]] \"Mrs Sinkins Pink\" was first raised at some point between 1868<ref>p20, ''The Changing Face of Slough'', Slough Museum, Breedon Books, Derby, 2003</ref> and 1883<ref>Fraser (1973), p. 100.</ref> by John Sinkins, the master of the [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] [[Poor Law Union|Union]] [[Workhouse]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plantprofile_pinks.shtml Plant profiles: Pinks, dianthus].

In 1847, he changed business and manufactured his [[:File:Ellimans-Universal-Embrocation-Slough-1897-Ad.png|''Elliman's Embrocation'']] and ''Royal Embrocation'' horse [[liniment]] at factories in Wellington Street and Chandos Street. Elliman became a major benefactor to the town, and is remembered today in the names of local roads and schools.\n\nIn September 1851, [[William Thomas Buckland]], an [[auctioneer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] from nearby [[Wraysbury]], began livestock sales in a field near the [[Slough railway station|''Great Western Road Railway Station'']] belonging to the ''North Star Inn''. Originally held on the first Tuesday of every month, the Cattle Market's popularity soon saw this increased to every Tuesday. A move to Wexham Street was necessitated by the postwar redevelopment of the town. The ''Slough Cattle Market'' was run by ''Messrs Buckland and Sons'' until its final closure in 1988.<ref>''The History of Buckland & Sons'' by Edward Barry Bowyer FRICS (1973).</ref>\n\nIn 1906, [[Horlicks|James Horlick]], one of the founders of the [[eponym]]ous [[malted milk]] company, opened a purpose-built red-brick factory near Slough Railway Station to manufacture his malted milk product. In 2015, the business was sold by Glaxo Smith Kline and in 2017, manufacturing at the site ceased altogether. The site is currently proposed to become residential making use of the original buildings as much as possible.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, [[Slough Estates Ltd]], the operator of the original [[Slough Trading Estate]], created and operated many more estates in the UK and abroad. The Slough Trading Estate meant that the town was largely insulated from many of the effects of [[recession]]. For many years, Slough's economy was mainly manufacturing-based.\n\nIn the last 20 or so years, there has been a major shift from a manufacturing to an information-based economy, with the closure of many factories (some of which had been in Slough for many decades). The factories are rapidly being replaced by office buildings. Hundreds of major companies have sited in Slough Trading Estate over the years, with its proximity to London [[Heathrow Airport]] and good motorway connections being attractive. In the 1960s, [[Gerry Anderson]]'s film company was based in Slough, and his [[Supermarionation]] series, including ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', were filmed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/15008144.Thunderbirds_return_to_their_Slough_home/|title=Thunderbirds return to their Slough home|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe UK headquarters of [[Mars, Incorporated]] is in Slough, the main factory having been established in 1932 by [[Forrest Mars Sr.]] and [[Frank C. Mars]]. It produced the [[Mars Bar]] in Slough over 70 years ago. One of the Mars factories has been demolished and some production has moved to the [[Czech Republic]]. The European head offices of major IT companies such as [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]], [[McAfee]], [[CA Technologies|Computer Associates]], [[PictureTel]] and Compusys (among others) are all in the town. [[O2 plc|O<sub>2</sub>]] is headquartered in the town across four buildings. The town is also home to the business support organisation [[Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce Group]] and [[National Foundation for Educational Research]], which is housed in the Mere.\n\nRecent new offices include those of [[Nintendo]], [[Black and Decker]] and [[Abbey business centres]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=502584 Location of registered office of Amazon.co.uk Ltd].

Previously, tests confirmed only at designated hospitals were considered \"presumed\" rather than \"confirmed\".\n\nThe increase of deaths on April 3 corresponds to a retroactive classification of about 20 deaths as being caused by [[SARS-CoV-2]] following autopsy.\n\n=== Quebec new cases per day ===\n{{Graph:Chart\n|width=650\n|colors=#FF6347\n|showValues= offset:2\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|type=rect\n|x=Feb 28,Feb29-Mar4, Mar 5, Mar 6, Mar 7, Mar 8, Mar 9, Mar 10, Mar 11, Mar 12, Mar 13, Mar 14, Mar 15, Mar 16, Mar 17, Mar 18, Mar 19, Mar 20, Mar 21, Mar 22,Mar 23, Mar 24, Mar 25,Mar 26,Mar 27,Mar 28,Mar 29,Mar 30, Mar 31,Apr 1, Apr 2, Apr 3, Apr 4,Apr 5, Apr 6, Apr 7, Apr 8, Apr 9, Apr 10, Apr 11\n|yAxisTitle=No. of new cases\n|legend=Legend\n|y1=1,0,1,1,0,1,0,3,1,9,0,7,15,11,24,20,27,18,42,38,409, 412, 299, 290, 392, 477, 342, 590, 732,449, 907, 583, 896, 947, 636, 760, 691, 881, 765, 615\n|y1Title=New cases per day\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n}}\n\n=== Montreal region new cases per day ===\n{{Graph:Chart\n|width=650\n|colors=#FF6347\n|showValues= offset:2\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|type=rect\n|x = Mar 14, Mar 15, Mar 16, Mar 17, Mar 18, Mar 19, Mar 20, Mar 21, Mar 22, Mar 23, Mar 24, Mar 25, Mar 26, Mar 27, Mar 28, Mar 29, Mar 30, Mar 31, Apr 1, Apr 2, Apr 3, Apr 4, Apr 5, Apr 6, Apr 7, Apr 8, Apr 9, Apr 10, Apr 11\n|yAxisTitle=No. of new cases\n|legend=Legend\n|y1 = 1, 2, 8, 4, 2, 4, 3, 10, 5, 219, 174, 164, 179, 189, 248, 142, 251, 379, 106, 545, 195, 424, 452, 264, 430, 368, 487, 355, 244\n|y1Title=New cases per day\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n}}\n\n=== Comparison to government projection ===\nA document released on March 16 showed some early government projections of the estimated number of cases, assuming that the restrictions then in place would not change.
