He is best remembered for having produced one of the earliest maps of [[Mars]] in 1867 from 27 drawings by the English observer [[William Rutter Dawes]]. His map was later superseded by those of [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Antoniadi]] and his nomenclature was dropped (for instance, his \"Kaiser Sea\" became [[Syrtis Major Planum]]).\n\nHe used old drawings of Mars dating back to 1666 to try to determine the [[sidereal day]] of Mars.  His final estimate, in 1873, was 24h 37m 22.713s, very close to the modern value of 24h 37m 22.663s.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Proctor, Richard A. | title = A New Determination of the Diurnal Rotation of the Planet Mars | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | date = 1867 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 309\u2013312 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0027//0000309.000.html|bibcode = 1867MNRAS..27..309P | doi=10.1093/mnras/27.9.309}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Proctor, Richard A. | title = Rotation of Mars | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | date = 1867 | volume = 28 | issue = 28 | pages = 37\u201339 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0028//0000037.000.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Proctor, Richard A. | title = The Rotation-period of Mars | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | date = 1867 | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 552\u2013558 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0033//0000552.000.html | doi = 10.1093/mnras/33.9.552 |bibcode = 1873MNRAS..33..552P }}</ref> Nevertheless, [[Frederik Kaiser]]'s value of 24h 37m 22.622s is closer, by 0.012 seconds in 88,642.688 seconds, a very small difference in the error of both computations.\n\nThe crater [[Proctor (Martian crater)|Proctor]] on Mars is named after him.\n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Richard_Proctor_Vanity_Fair_3_March_1883.jpg|thumb|left|<center>\"Astronomy\"<br>Richard Proctor as caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 3 March 1883</center>]]\nHe was a delicate child, and, his father dying in 1850, his mother attended herself to his education.

He graduated in 1860 as 23rd wrangler.<ref>{{acad|id=PRCR856RA|name=Proctor, Richard Anthony}}</ref> His marriage while still an undergraduate probably accounted for his low place in the tripos.\n\nHe then read for the bar, but turned to [[astronomy]] and authorship instead, and in 1865 published an article on the ''Colours of Double Stars'' in the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]''. His first book ''[[Saturn]] and its System'' was published in the same year, at his own expense. This work contains an elaborate account of the phenomena presented by the planet; but although favourably received by astronomers, it had no great sale. He intended to follow it up with similar treatises on [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[comet]]s and [[meteor]]s, [[star]]s, and [[nebula]]e, and had in fact commenced a monograph on Mars, when the failure of a [[New Zealand]] bank deprived him of an independence which would have enabled him to carry out his scheme without anxiety as to its commercial success or failure.\n\nBeing thus obliged to depend upon his writings for the support of his family, and having learned by the fate of his ''Saturn and its System'' that the general public are not attracted by works requiring arduous study, he cultivated a more popular style. He wrote for a number of periodicals; and although he has stated that he would at this time willingly have turned to stone-breaking on the roads, or any other form of hard and honest but unscientific labour, if a modest competence had been offered him in any such direction, he attained a high degree of popularity, and his numerous works had a wide influence in familiarising the public with the main facts of astronomy.\n\nHis earlier efforts were, however, not always successful. His ''Handbook of the Stars'' (1866) was refused by Messrs Longmans and Messrs Macmillan, but being privately printed, it sold fairly well. For his ''[[Half-Hours with the Telescope]]'' (1868), which eventually reached a 20th edition, he received originally \u00a325 from Messrs Hardwick. Although teaching was uncongenial to him he took pupils in mathematics, and held for a time the position of mathematical coach for Woolwich and Sandhurst.\n\nHis literary standing meantime improved, and he became a regular contributor to ''[[The Intellectual Observer]]'', ''[[Chamber's Journal]]'' and the ''[[Popular Science Review]]''. In 1870 appeared his ''[[Other Worlds Than Ours (Proctor book)|Other Worlds Than Ours]]'',<ref>Richard A.

([http://hdl.handle.net/2027/chi.57121156 Digital Copy])</ref> in which he discussed the question of the plurality of worlds in the light of new facts. This was followed by a long series of popular treatises in rapid succession, amongst the more important of which are ''Light Science for Leisure Hours'' and ''The Sun'' (1871); ''The Orbs around Us'' and ''Essays on Astronomy'' (1872); ''The Expanse of Heaven'', ''The Moon'' and ''The Borderland of Science'' (1873); ''The Universe and the Coming Transits'' and ''Transits of Venus'' (1874); ''Our Place among Infinities'' (1875); [https://archive.org/details/mythsmarvelsofas00procuoft ''Myths and Marvels of Astronomy'' (1877)]; ''The Universe of Stars'' (1878); ''Flowers of the Sky'' (1879); ''The Poetry of Astronomy'' (1880); ''Easy Star Lessons'' and ''Familiar Science Studies'' (1882); [https://archive.org/details/mysteriesoftimes00proc ''Mysteries of Time and Space (1883) - Digital Copy]''; [https://archive.org/details/greatpyramidobse00proc \"The Great Pyramid\" (1883) - Digital Copy]; ''The Universe of Suns'' (1884); ''The Seasons'' (1885); ''Other Suns than Ours'' and ''Half-Hours with the Stars'' (1887).\n\nIn 1881 he founded ''[[Knowledge (magazine)|Knowledge]]'', a popular weekly magazine of science (converted into a monthly in 1885), which had a considerable circulation. In it he wrote on a great variety of subjects, including chess and whist.\n\nHe was also the author of the articles on astronomy in the ''[[American Cyclopaedia]]'' and the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', and was well known as a popular lecturer on astronomy in England, [[United States|America]] and Australia.\n\n[[Image:Proctor Mars Map.jpg|right|thumb|Proctor's map of Mars]]\n\nElected a fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1866, he became honorary secretary in 1872, and contributed eighty-three separate papers to its Monthly Notices. Of these the more noteworthy dealt with the distribution of stars, [[star cluster]]s and nebulae, and the construction of the [[sidereal universe]]. He was an expert in all that related to map-drawing, and published two star-atlases. A chart on an [[isographic projection]], exhibiting all the stars contained in the [[Bonner Durchmusterung]], was designed to show the laws according to which the stars down to the 9\u201310th magnitude are distributed over the northern heavens.

While the complete hormonal mechanisms are still being understood, it is now widely accepted that  this is a hormonal procedure in addition to restriction and malabsorption properties.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gastric bypass is a permanent procedure that helps patients reset hunger and satiety and by altering stomach and small intestine handle the food that is eaten to achieve and maintain weight loss goals. After the surgery, the stomach will be smaller and there will be an increase in baseline satiety hormones, to help the patient will feel full with less food.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe gastric bypass had been the most commonly performed operation for weight loss in the United States, and approximately 140,000 gastric bypass procedures were performed in 2005. Its market share has decreased since then and by 2011, the frequency of gastric bypass was thought to be less than 50% of the weight loss surgery market. \n<ref name=\"SMD\"/>\n\nA factor in the success of any bariatric surgery is strict post-surgical adherence to a healthy pattern of eating.\n\nThere are certain patients who cannot tolerate the malabsorption and dumping syndrome associated with gastric bypass. In such patients, although earlier considered to be an irreversible procedure, there are instances where gastric bypass procedure can be partially reversed.\n\n[[Image:Sleeve gastrectomy duodenal switch.png|thumb|Diagram of a sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal switch.]]\n\n====Sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal switch====\nA variation of the biliopancreatic diversion includes a [[duodenal switch]]. The part of the [[stomach]] along its greater curve is resected. The stomach is \"tubulized\" with a residual volume of about 150 ml. This volume reduction provides the food intake restriction component of this operation. This type of gastric resection is anatomically and functionally irreversible. The stomach is then disconnected from the duodenum and connected to the distal part of the [[small intestine]]. The duodenum and the upper part of the small intestine are reattached to the rest at about 75\u2013100&nbsp;cm from the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Citation|title=Gastric Sleeve Surgery Steps & Procedure|url=https://www.alobariatriccenter.com/gastric-sleeve-surgical-steps/}}.

Mean patient age was 34, with a mean BMI of 35. Follow-up visits for the assessment of safety and weight loss were scheduled at regular intervals in the postoperative period. No major complications were reported among the 66 patients. Weight loss outcomes are comparable to [[gastric bypass]].\n\nThe study describes gastric sleeve plication (also referred to as [[gastric imbrication]] or [[laparoscopic greater curvature plication]]) as a restrictive technique that eliminates the complications associated with adjustable [[gastric banding]] and vertical [[sleeve gastrectomy]]\u2014it does this by creating restriction without the use of implants and without gastric resection (cutting) and staples.\n\n===Mixed procedures===\nMixed procedures apply block and restrict at the same time.\n\n[[Image:Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.png|thumb|Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.]]\n\n====Gastric bypass surgery====\n{{Main|Gastric bypass surgery}}\n\nA common form of [[gastric bypass surgery]] is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, designed to alter the gut hormones that control hunger and satiety. While the complete hormonal mechanisms are still being understood, it is now widely accepted that  this is a hormonal procedure in addition to restriction and malabsorption properties<ref name=\":0\" />. Gastric bypass is a permanent procedure that helps patients reset hunger and satiety and by altering stomach and small intestine handle the food that is eaten to achieve and maintain weight loss goals. After the surgery, the stomach will be smaller and there will be an increase in baseline satiety hormones, to help the patient will feel full with less food<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe gastric bypass had been the most commonly performed operation for weight loss in the United States, and approximately 140,000 gastric bypass procedures were performed in 2005. Its market share has decreased since then and by 2011, the frequency of gastric bypass was thought to be less than 50% of the weight loss surgery market. \n<ref name=\"SMD\"/>\n\nA factor in the success of any bariatric surgery is strict post-surgical adherence to a healthy pattern of eating.\n\nThere are certain patients who cannot tolerate the malabsorption and dumping syndrome associated with gastric bypass. In such patients, although earlier considered to be an irreversible procedure, there are instances where gastric bypass procedure can be partially reversed.\n\n[[Image:Sleeve gastrectomy duodenal switch.png|thumb|Diagram of a sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal switch.]]\n\n====Sleeve gastrectomy with duodenal switch====\nA variation of the biliopancreatic diversion includes a [[duodenal switch]]. The part of the [[stomach]] along its greater curve is resected. The stomach is \"tubulized\" with a residual volume of about 150 ml. This volume reduction provides the food intake restriction component of this operation. This type of gastric resection is anatomically and functionally irreversible. The stomach is then disconnected from the duodenum and connected to the distal part of the [[small intestine]]. The duodenum and the upper part of the small intestine are reattached to the rest at about 75\u2013100&nbsp;cm from the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{Citation|title=Gastric Sleeve Surgery Steps & Procedure|url=https://www.alobariatriccenter.com/gastric-sleeve-surgical-steps/}}. Like the Roux en Y Bypass, it is now understood that it's results are largely due to a significant alteration in gut hormones that control hunger and satiety, in addition to its restriction and malabsorption properties<ref name=\":0\" />. The addition of the sleeve gastrectomy, causes further gut hormone set- point alterations by reducing levels of the hunger hormone, Ghrelin<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n====Implantable gastric stimulation====\nThis procedure where a device similar to a heart pacemaker that is implanted by a surgeon, with the electrical leads stimulating the external surface of the stomach, is being studied in the USA. Electrical stimulation is thought to modify the activity of the [[enteric nervous system]] of the stomach, which is interpreted by the brain to give a sense of satiety, or fullness. Early evidence suggests that it is less effective than other forms of bariatric surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pardo JV, Sheikh SA, Kuskowski MA, Surerus-Johnson C, Hagen MC, Lee JT, Rittberg BR, Adson DE | title = Weight loss during chronic, cervical vagus nerve stimulation in depressed patients with obesity: an observation | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 1756\u20139 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17563762 | pmc = 2365729 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803666 }}</ref>\n\n==Subsequent procedures==\nAfter a person successfully loses weight following bariatric surgery, they are usually left with excess skin.

This diet is continued until the gastrointestinal tract has recovered somewhat from the surgery.  The next stage provides a blended or pureed sugar-free diet for at least two weeks. This may consist of high protein, liquid or soft foods such as protein shakes, soft meats, and dairy products. Foods high in carbohydrates are usually avoided when possible during the initial weight loss period.\n\nPost-surgery, overeating is curbed because exceeding the capacity of the stomach causes [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. Diet restrictions after recovery from surgery depend in part on the type of surgery.  Many patients will need to take a daily [[multivitamin]] pill for life to compensate for reduced absorption of essential nutrients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tucker ON, Szomstein S, Rosenthal RJ | title = Nutritional consequences of weight-loss surgery | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 499\u2013514, xii | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17509392 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcna.2007.01.006 }}</ref>  Because patients cannot eat a large quantity of food, physicians typically recommend a diet that is relatively high in protein and low in fats and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].\n\n=== Fluid recommendations ===\nIt is very common, within the first month post-surgery, for a patient to undergo volume depletion and dehydration.

An education in reading and religion was required for children by the [[Massachusetts School Law of 1642]]. This law was later strengthened by the famous [[Old Deluder Satan Law|Old Deluder Satan Act]]. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore it was considered necessary that all children be taught how to read. <ref name=Harper/> Dame schools fulfilled this requirement when parents were unable to educate their young children in their own home. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom they would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers and religious beliefs. These women received ''\"''tuition''\"'' in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included, and often did not exceed, a [[hornbook]], primer, [[Psalter]] and [[Bible]].<ref name=\"Harper\">Harper, Elizabeth P. \"Dame Schools\".

The number we found to be actually on the books was 2,535,462, thus leaving 120,305 children without any school instruction whatever.\n</blockquote>\nThey looked at the previous year's data and found that 2,213,694 children of the poorer classes were in elementary day schools. But of this number: \n*573,536 were attending private schools, such as dame schools where a woman provided child care facilities and a little reading, writing and arithmetic in her own home. These failed to give the children an education which would be serviceable to them in later life. \n*The other 1,549,312 children were attending public elementary day schools belonging to the religious denominations (church schools), but all but 19.3% were under 12, so were in primary departments.

The education provided by these schools ranged from basic to exceptional.<ref>Perlmann, Joel, and Robert Margo. Women's work?: American schoolteachers, 1650-1920.

Transformations in schooling: historical and comparative perspectives. New York: Macmillan (2007), 91.</ref>\n\nMotivated by the religious needs of [[Puritan]] society and their own economic needs, some colonial women in 17th century rural New England opened small, private schools in their homes to teach reading and catechism to young children. An education in reading and religion was required for children by the [[Massachusetts School Law of 1642]]. This law was later strengthened by the famous [[Old Deluder Satan Law|Old Deluder Satan Act]]. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore it was considered necessary that all children be taught how to read. <ref name=Harper/> Dame schools fulfilled this requirement when parents were unable to educate their young children in their own home. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom they would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers and religious beliefs. These women received ''\"''tuition''\"'' in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included, and often did not exceed, a [[hornbook]], primer, [[Psalter]] and [[Bible]].<ref name=\"Harper\">Harper, Elizabeth P. \"Dame Schools\".

Due to its broad and persistent prevalence throughout antiquity as a mysterious disease of diverse symptomatic outcomes, leishmaniasis has been dubbed with various names ranging from \"white leprosy\" to \"[[black fever]]\".

They independently visualised microscopic single-celled parasites (later called Leishman-Donovan bodies) living within the cells of infected human organs. The parasitic genus would later be classed as [[trypanosomatid]] [[protozoans]] under the [[phylogenetic]] designation, ''[[Leishmania donovani]]''. Several species have since been classified and grouped under two major subgenera i.e. ''Leishmania Viannia'' (generally located in the [[Neotropics]])  or ''Leishmania Leishmania'' (generally located in the [[Paleotropics]], with the major exception of the ''[[Leishmania mexicana|L. mexicana]]'' subgroup).\n\n==Epidemiology==\n''Leishmania'' currently affects 6 million people in 98 countries.

Depending on the stage of their life cycle, they exist in two structural variants, as:<ref name=dna>{{cite web|title=Morphology and Life Cycle|url=http://dna.kdna.ucla.edu/parasite_course-old/leish_files/subchapters/morphology%20and%20life%20cycle.htm|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Pulvertaft|first=RJ|author2=Hoyle, GF |title=Stages in the life-cycle of Leishmania donovani.|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=1960|volume=54|issue=2|pages=191\u20136|doi=10.1016/0035-9203(60)90057-2|pmid=14435316}}</ref>  \n#The '''amastigote''' form is found in the mononuclear phagocytes and circulatory systems of humans. It is an intracellular and nonmotile form, being devoid of external flagella. The short flagellum is embedded at the anterior end without projecting out. It is oval in shape, and measures 3\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m in length and 1\u20133&nbsp;\u00b5m in breadth. The kinetoplast and basal body lie towards the anterior end.\n#The '''promastigote''' form is found in the [[alimentary tract]] of sandflies. It is an extracellular and motile form. It is considerably larger and highly elongated, measuring 15-30&nbsp;\u00b5m in length and 5&nbsp;\u00b5m in width. It is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. A long flagellum (about the body length) is projected externally at the anterior end. The nucleus lies at the centre, and in front of it are the kinetoplast and the basal body.\n[[File:Leish amastig macrofago.jpg|thumb|''L. infantum'' amastigote forms]]\n\n==Evolution==\nThe details of the evolution of this genus are debated, but ''Leishmania'' apparently evolved from an ancestral trypanosome lineage. The oldest lineage is that of the [[Bodonidae]], followed by ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', the latter being confined to the African continent. ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' groups with [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s from bats, South American mammals, and [[kangaroo]]s suggest an origin in the Southern Hemisphere. These clades are only distantly related.\n\nThe remaining clades in this tree are ''[[Blastocrithidia]]'', ''[[Herpetomonas]]'', and ''[[Phytomonas]]''. The four genera ''[[Leptomonas]]'', ''[[Crithidia]]'', ''Leishmania'', and ''[[Endotrypanum]]'' form the terminal branches, suggesting a relatively recent origin.

They share the same main morphological features, including a single [[flagellum]] which has an invagination, the flagellar pocket, at its base, a [[kinetoplast]], which is found in the single [[mitochondrion]], and a subpelicular array of microtubules, which make up the main part of the [[cytoskeleton]].\n\n===Lipophosphoglycan coat===\n''Leishmania'' possesses a [[lipophosphoglycan]] coat over the outside of the cell. Lipophosphoglycan is a trigger for [[TLR 2|toll-like receptor 2]], a signalling receptor involved in triggering an [[innate immune system|innate immune response]] in mammals.\n\nThe precise structure of lipophosphoglycan varies depending on the species and [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]] stage of the parasite. The glycan component is particularly variable and different lipophosphoglycan variants can be used as a [[molecular marker]] for different lifecycle stages. [[Lectin]]s, a group of [[plant]] [[proteins]] which bind different glycans, are often used to detect these lipophosphoglycan variants. For example, [[peanut agglutinin]] binds a particular lipophosphoglycan found on the surface of the infective form of ''L. major''.\n\nLipophosphoglycan is used by the parasite to promote its survival in the host and the mechanisms by which the parasite does this center around modulating the immune response of the host. This is vital, as the ''Leishmania'' parasites live within [[macrophages]] and need to prevent the macrophages from killing them. Lipophosphoglycan has a role in resisting the [[complement system]], inhibiting the [[oxidative burst]] response, inducing an [[inflammation]] response and preventing [[Natural Killer T cell|natural killer T cells]] recognising that the macrophage is infected with the ''Leishmania'' parasite.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This location enables it to avoid the action of the [[humoral immune response]] (because the pathogen is safely inside a cell and outside the open bloodstream), and furthermore it may prevent the immune system from destroying its host through nondanger surface signals which discourage [[apoptosis]]. The primary cell types ''Leishmania'' infiltrates are [[phagocytosis|phagocytotic]] cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vannier-Santos|first=MA|author2=Martiny A |author3=de Souza W.|title=Cell biology of Leishmania spp.: invading and evading.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=August 2002|pages=297\u2013318|pmid=11860368|volume=8|issue=4|doi=10.2174/1381612023396230}}</ref>\n\nUsually, a phagocytotic immune cell like a macrophage will ingest a pathogen within an enclosed [[endosome]] and then fill this endosome with enzymes which digest the pathogen. However, in the case of ''Leishmania'', these enzymes have no effect, allowing the parasite to multiply rapidly. This uninhibited growth of parasites eventually overwhelms the host macrophage or other immune cell, causing it to die.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=William E.|title=Infectious Diseases and the Immune System|journal=Scientific American|volume=269|issue=3|date=September 1993|pages=94\u201395|bibcode=1993SciAm.269c..90P|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0993-90}}</ref>\n\nTransmitted by the [[sandfly]], the [[protozoan]] [[parasitism|parasites]] of ''L. major'' may switch the strategy of the first immune defense from eating/inflammation/killing to eating/no inflammation/no killing of their host [[phagocyte]] and corrupt it for their own benefit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} They use the willingly phagocytosing polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) rigorously as a tricky hideout, where they [[cell growth|proliferate]] unrecognized from the immune system and enter the long-lived [[macrophages]] to establish a \"hidden\" [[infection]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n===Uptake and survival===\n[[File:Leishmaniasis life cycle diagram en.svg|thumb|579px|center|Lifecycle of ''Leishmania'']]\n\nUpon [[microbial]] infection, PMNs move out from the bloodstream  through the vessels\u2019 endothelial layer, to the site of the infected tissue (dermal tissue after fly bite). They immediately initiate the first immune response and phagocytize the invader by recognition of foreign and activating surfaces on the parasite. Activated PMN secrete  [[chemokines]],  [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]] particularly, to attract further [[granulocytes]] and stimulate phagocytosis. Further, ''L. major'' increases the secretion of IL-8 by PMNs. This mechanism is observed during infection with other [[obligate intracellular parasites]], as well. For microbes like these,  multiple intracellular survival mechanisms exist. Surprisingly, the coinjection of apoptotic and viable pathogens causes by far a more fulminate course of disease than injection of only viable parasites. When the anti-inflammatory signal [[phosphatidylserine]] usually found on apoptotic cells, is exposed on the surface of dead parasites, ''L. major'' switches off the [[oxidative burst]], thereby preventing killing and degradation of the viable pathogen.\n\nIn the case of  ''Leishmania'', progeny are not generated in PMNs, but in this way they can survive and persist untangled in the primary site of infection. The promastigote forms also release ''Leishmania'' chemotactic factor (LCF) to actively recruit neutrophils, but not other [[leukocytes]], for instance [[monocytes]] or [[NK cells]]. In addition to that, the production of [[interferon gamma]] (IFN\u03b3)-inducible protein 10 (IP10) by PMNs is blocked in attendance of   ''Leishmania'', what involves the shut down of inflammatory and protective immune response by NK and [[Th1 cell]]  recruitment. The pathogens stay viable during phagocytosis since their primary hosts, the PMNs, expose apoptotic cell-associated molecular pattern (ACAMP) signaling \"no pathogen\".\n\n===Persistency and attraction===\nThe lifespan of [[neutrophil granulocytes]] is quite short. They circulate in [[bloodstream]] for about 6 to 10 hours after leaving [[bone marrow]], whereupon they undergo spontaneous [[apoptosis]]. Microbial pathogens have been reported to influence cellular apoptosis by different strategies. Obviously because of the inhibition of [[caspase]]3-activation, ''L. major'' can induce the delay of neutrophils apoptosis and extend their lifespan for at least 2\u20133 days. The fact of extended lifespan is very beneficial for the development of infection because the final host cells for these parasites are macrophages, which normally migrate to the sites of infection within two or three days. The pathogens are not dronish; instead they take over the command at the primary site of infection. They induce the production by PMNs of the chemokines MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 ([[macrophage inflammatory protein]]) to recruit macrophages.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |vauthors=Laskay T, etal | year = 2003\n | title = Neutrophil granulocytes \u2013 Trojan horses for ''Leishmania major'' and other intracellular microbes?\n | journal = Trends in Microbiology\n | volume = 11\n | issue = 5\n | pages = 210\u20134\n | doi = 10.1016/S0966-842X(03)00075-1\n | pmid = 12781523\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Silent phagocytosis theory ===\nTo save the integrity of the surrounding tissue from the [[toxic]] cell components and [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s contained in neutrophils, the apoptotic PMNs are silently cleared by macrophages. Dying PMNs expose the \"eat me\"-signal [[phosphatidylserine]] which is transferred to the outer leaflet of the [[plasma membrane]] during apoptosis. By reason of delayed apoptosis, the parasites that persist in PMNs are taken up into macrophages, employing an absolutely [[physiology|physiological]] and nonphlogistic process. The strategy of this \"silent phagocytosis\" has the following advantages for the parasite:\n\n* Taking up apoptotic cells silences macrophage killing activity leading to a survival of the pathogens.\n* Pathogens inside of PMNs have no direct contact to the macrophage surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], because they can not see the parasite inside the apoptotic cell. So, the activation of the phagocyte for immune activation does not occur.\n\nHowever, studies have shown this is unlikely, as the pathogens are seen to leave apoptopic cells and no evidence is known of macrophage uptake by this method.\n\n== Molecular biology ==\nAn important aspect of the ''Leishmania'' protozoan is its [[glycoconjugate]] layer of [[lipophosphoglycan]] (LPG).  This is held together with a phosphoinositide membrane anchor, and has a tripartite structure consisting of a lipid domain, a neutral hexasaccharide, and a phosphorylated galactose-mannose, with a termination in a neutral cap.  Not only do these parasites develop postphlebotomus digestion, but it is also thought to be essential to oxidative bursts, thus allowing passage for infection. Characteristics of intracellular digestion include an [[endosome]] fusing with a [[lysosome]], releasing acid [[hydrolase]]s which degrade [[DNA]], [[RNA]], proteins and [[carbohydrates]].\n\n== Genomics ==\n[[File:Leishmania tropica 7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Leishmania tropica]]'']]\n\nThe genomes of four ''Leishmania'' species (''L. major'', ''L. infantum'', ''L. donovani'' and ''L. braziliensis'') have been sequenced, revealing more than 8300 protein-coding and 900 [[RNA]] genes. Almost 40% of protein-coding genes fall into 662 families containing between two and 500 members. Most of the smaller gene families are tandem arrays of one to three genes, while the larger gene families are often dispersed in tandem arrays at different [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] throughout the [[genome]].  Each of the 35 or 36 [[chromosome]]s is organized into a small number of gene clusters of tens-to-hundreds of genes on the same DNA strand.  These clusters can be organized in head-to-head (divergent) or tail-to-tail (convergent) fashion, with the latter often separated by [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]] and/or [[snRNA]] genes.  Transcription of protein-coding genes initiates bidirectionally in the divergent strand-switch regions between gene clusters and extends poly[[cistron]]ically through each gene cluster before terminating in the strand-switch region separating convergent clusters.  ''Leishmania'' [[telomere]]s are usually relatively small, consisting of a few different types of repeat sequence.  Evidence can be found for recombination between several different groups of telomeres.  The ''L. major'' and ''L. infantum'' genomes contain only about 50 copies of inactive degenerated ''Ingi''/L1Tc-related elements (DIREs), while ''L. braziliensis'' also contains several telomere-associated transposable elements and spliced leader-associated retroelements.  The ''Leishmania'' genomes share a conserved core proteome of about 6200 genes with the related trypanosomatids ''Trypanosoma brucei''  and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'', but around 1000 ''Leishmania''-specific genes are known, which are mostly randomly distributed throughout the genome.  Relatively few (about 200) species-specific differences in gene content exist between the three sequenced ''Leishmania'' genomes, but about 8% of the genes appear to be evolving at different rates between the three species, indicative of different selective pressures that could be related to disease pathology.

They independently visualised microscopic single-celled parasites (later called Leishman-Donovan bodies) living within the cells of infected human organs. The parasitic genus would later be classed as [[trypanosomatid]] [[protozoans]] under the [[phylogenetic]] designation, ''[[Leishmania donovani]]''. Several species have since been classified and grouped under two major subgenera i.e. ''Leishmania Viannia'' (generally located in the [[Neotropics]])  or ''Leishmania Leishmania'' (generally located in the [[Paleotropics]], with the major exception of the ''[[Leishmania mexicana|L. mexicana]]'' subgroup).\n\n==Epidemiology==\n''Leishmania'' currently affects 6 million people in 98 countries.

The oldest lineage is that of the [[Bodonidae]], followed by ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', the latter being confined to the African continent. ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' groups with [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s from bats, South American mammals, and [[kangaroo]]s suggest an origin in the Southern Hemisphere. These clades are only distantly related.\n\nThe remaining clades in this tree are ''[[Blastocrithidia]]'', ''[[Herpetomonas]]'', and ''[[Phytomonas]]''. The four genera ''[[Leptomonas]]'', ''[[Crithidia]]'', ''Leishmania'', and ''[[Endotrypanum]]'' form the terminal branches, suggesting a relatively recent origin.

They share the same main morphological features, including a single [[flagellum]] which has an invagination, the flagellar pocket, at its base, a [[kinetoplast]], which is found in the single [[mitochondrion]], and a subpelicular array of microtubules, which make up the main part of the [[cytoskeleton]].\n\n===Lipophosphoglycan coat===\n''Leishmania'' possesses a [[lipophosphoglycan]] coat over the outside of the cell. Lipophosphoglycan is a trigger for [[TLR 2|toll-like receptor 2]], a signalling receptor involved in triggering an [[innate immune system|innate immune response]] in mammals.\n\nThe precise structure of lipophosphoglycan varies depending on the species and [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]] stage of the parasite. The glycan component is particularly variable and different lipophosphoglycan variants can be used as a [[molecular marker]] for different lifecycle stages. [[Lectin]]s, a group of [[plant]] [[proteins]] which bind different glycans, are often used to detect these lipophosphoglycan variants. For example, [[peanut agglutinin]] binds a particular lipophosphoglycan found on the surface of the infective form of ''L. major''.\n\nLipophosphoglycan is used by the parasite to promote its survival in the host and the mechanisms by which the parasite does this center around modulating the immune response of the host. This is vital, as the ''Leishmania'' parasites live within [[macrophages]] and need to prevent the macrophages from killing them. Lipophosphoglycan has a role in resisting the [[complement system]], inhibiting the [[oxidative burst]] response, inducing an [[inflammation]] response and preventing [[Natural Killer T cell|natural killer T cells]] recognising that the macrophage is infected with the ''Leishmania'' parasite.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This location enables it to avoid the action of the [[humoral immune response]] (because the pathogen is safely inside a cell and outside the open bloodstream), and furthermore it may prevent the immune system from destroying its host through nondanger surface signals which discourage [[apoptosis]]. The primary cell types ''Leishmania'' infiltrates are [[phagocytosis|phagocytotic]] cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vannier-Santos|first=MA|author2=Martiny A |author3=de Souza W.|title=Cell biology of Leishmania spp.: invading and evading.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=August 2002|pages=297\u2013318|pmid=11860368|volume=8|issue=4|doi=10.2174/1381612023396230}}</ref>\n\nUsually, a phagocytotic immune cell like a macrophage will ingest a pathogen within an enclosed [[endosome]] and then fill this endosome with enzymes which digest the pathogen. However, in the case of ''Leishmania'', these enzymes have no effect, allowing the parasite to multiply rapidly. This uninhibited growth of parasites eventually overwhelms the host macrophage or other immune cell, causing it to die.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=William E.|title=Infectious Diseases and the Immune System|journal=Scientific American|volume=269|issue=3|date=September 1993|pages=94\u201395|bibcode=1993SciAm.269c..90P|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0993-90}}</ref>\n\nTransmitted by the [[sandfly]], the [[protozoan]] [[parasitism|parasites]] of ''L. major'' may switch the strategy of the first immune defense from eating/inflammation/killing to eating/no inflammation/no killing of their host [[phagocyte]] and corrupt it for their own benefit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} They use the willingly phagocytosing polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) rigorously as a tricky hideout, where they [[cell growth|proliferate]] unrecognized from the immune system and enter the long-lived [[macrophages]] to establish a \"hidden\" [[infection]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n===Uptake and survival===\n[[File:Leishmaniasis life cycle diagram en.svg|thumb|579px|center|Lifecycle of ''Leishmania'']]\n\nUpon [[microbial]] infection, PMNs move out from the bloodstream  through the vessels\u2019 endothelial layer, to the site of the infected tissue (dermal tissue after fly bite). They immediately initiate the first immune response and phagocytize the invader by recognition of foreign and activating surfaces on the parasite. Activated PMN secrete  [[chemokines]],  [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]] particularly, to attract further [[granulocytes]] and stimulate phagocytosis. Further, ''L. major'' increases the secretion of IL-8 by PMNs. This mechanism is observed during infection with other [[obligate intracellular parasites]], as well. For microbes like these,  multiple intracellular survival mechanisms exist. Surprisingly, the coinjection of apoptotic and viable pathogens causes by far a more fulminate course of disease than injection of only viable parasites. When the anti-inflammatory signal [[phosphatidylserine]] usually found on apoptotic cells, is exposed on the surface of dead parasites, ''L. major'' switches off the [[oxidative burst]], thereby preventing killing and degradation of the viable pathogen.\n\nIn the case of  ''Leishmania'', progeny are not generated in PMNs, but in this way they can survive and persist untangled in the primary site of infection. The promastigote forms also release ''Leishmania'' chemotactic factor (LCF) to actively recruit neutrophils, but not other [[leukocytes]], for instance [[monocytes]] or [[NK cells]]. In addition to that, the production of [[interferon gamma]] (IFN\u03b3)-inducible protein 10 (IP10) by PMNs is blocked in attendance of   ''Leishmania'', what involves the shut down of inflammatory and protective immune response by NK and [[Th1 cell]]  recruitment. The pathogens stay viable during phagocytosis since their primary hosts, the PMNs, expose apoptotic cell-associated molecular pattern (ACAMP) signaling \"no pathogen\".\n\n===Persistency and attraction===\nThe lifespan of [[neutrophil granulocytes]] is quite short. They circulate in [[bloodstream]] for about 6 to 10 hours after leaving [[bone marrow]], whereupon they undergo spontaneous [[apoptosis]]. Microbial pathogens have been reported to influence cellular apoptosis by different strategies. Obviously because of the inhibition of [[caspase]]3-activation, ''L. major'' can induce the delay of neutrophils apoptosis and extend their lifespan for at least 2\u20133 days. The fact of extended lifespan is very beneficial for the development of infection because the final host cells for these parasites are macrophages, which normally migrate to the sites of infection within two or three days. The pathogens are not dronish; instead they take over the command at the primary site of infection. They induce the production by PMNs of the chemokines MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 ([[macrophage inflammatory protein]]) to recruit macrophages.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |vauthors=Laskay T, etal | year = 2003\n | title = Neutrophil granulocytes \u2013 Trojan horses for ''Leishmania major'' and other intracellular microbes?\n | journal = Trends in Microbiology\n | volume = 11\n | issue = 5\n | pages = 210\u20134\n | doi = 10.1016/S0966-842X(03)00075-1\n | pmid = 12781523\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Silent phagocytosis theory ===\nTo save the integrity of the surrounding tissue from the [[toxic]] cell components and [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s contained in neutrophils, the apoptotic PMNs are silently cleared by macrophages. Dying PMNs expose the \"eat me\"-signal [[phosphatidylserine]] which is transferred to the outer leaflet of the [[plasma membrane]] during apoptosis. By reason of delayed apoptosis, the parasites that persist in PMNs are taken up into macrophages, employing an absolutely [[physiology|physiological]] and nonphlogistic process. The strategy of this \"silent phagocytosis\" has the following advantages for the parasite:\n\n* Taking up apoptotic cells silences macrophage killing activity leading to a survival of the pathogens.\n* Pathogens inside of PMNs have no direct contact to the macrophage surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], because they can not see the parasite inside the apoptotic cell. So, the activation of the phagocyte for immune activation does not occur.\n\nHowever, studies have shown this is unlikely, as the pathogens are seen to leave apoptopic cells and no evidence is known of macrophage uptake by this method.\n\n== Molecular biology ==\nAn important aspect of the ''Leishmania'' protozoan is its [[glycoconjugate]] layer of [[lipophosphoglycan]] (LPG).  This is held together with a phosphoinositide membrane anchor, and has a tripartite structure consisting of a lipid domain, a neutral hexasaccharide, and a phosphorylated galactose-mannose, with a termination in a neutral cap.  Not only do these parasites develop postphlebotomus digestion, but it is also thought to be essential to oxidative bursts, thus allowing passage for infection. Characteristics of intracellular digestion include an [[endosome]] fusing with a [[lysosome]], releasing acid [[hydrolase]]s which degrade [[DNA]], [[RNA]], proteins and [[carbohydrates]].\n\n== Genomics ==\n[[File:Leishmania tropica 7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Leishmania tropica]]'']]\n\nThe genomes of four ''Leishmania'' species (''L. major'', ''L. infantum'', ''L. donovani'' and ''L. braziliensis'') have been sequenced, revealing more than 8300 protein-coding and 900 [[RNA]] genes. Almost 40% of protein-coding genes fall into 662 families containing between two and 500 members. Most of the smaller gene families are tandem arrays of one to three genes, while the larger gene families are often dispersed in tandem arrays at different [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] throughout the [[genome]].  Each of the 35 or 36 [[chromosome]]s is organized into a small number of gene clusters of tens-to-hundreds of genes on the same DNA strand.  These clusters can be organized in head-to-head (divergent) or tail-to-tail (convergent) fashion, with the latter often separated by [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]] and/or [[snRNA]] genes.  Transcription of protein-coding genes initiates bidirectionally in the divergent strand-switch regions between gene clusters and extends poly[[cistron]]ically through each gene cluster before terminating in the strand-switch region separating convergent clusters.  ''Leishmania'' [[telomere]]s are usually relatively small, consisting of a few different types of repeat sequence.  Evidence can be found for recombination between several different groups of telomeres.  The ''L. major'' and ''L. infantum'' genomes contain only about 50 copies of inactive degenerated ''Ingi''/L1Tc-related elements (DIREs), while ''L. braziliensis'' also contains several telomere-associated transposable elements and spliced leader-associated retroelements.  The ''Leishmania'' genomes share a conserved core proteome of about 6200 genes with the related trypanosomatids ''Trypanosoma brucei''  and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'', but around 1000 ''Leishmania''-specific genes are known, which are mostly randomly distributed throughout the genome.  Relatively few (about 200) species-specific differences in gene content exist between the three sequenced ''Leishmania'' genomes, but about 8% of the genes appear to be evolving at different rates between the three species, indicative of different selective pressures that could be related to disease pathology.  About 65% of protein-coding genes currently lack functional assignment.<ref name=MylerP/>\n\n''Leishmania'' species produce several different [[heat shock protein]]s.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===[[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]]===\n(September 10\u201311, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Campaign Davis's Cross Roads.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863]]\nBragg intended to attack General James S. Negley's isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army at that location. He ordered the divisions of Thomas Hindman and Patrick Cleburne to concentrate together and launch a joint attack under Hindman's command. Due to delays in conveying orders, Cleburne's division failed to arrive in time on the 10th, while Thomas reinforced the isolated division with the rest of his corps including the Lightning Brigade. After the two divisions were united the next day, they failed to launch a coordinated attack on Thomas' positions and were repulsed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nJust before the start of the battle, on 18 Spetember, the Lightning Brigade played a crucial role. At Alexander's Bridge to the south, the brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position.

Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007).

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS/>\n\n===[[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]]===\n(September 10\u201311, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Campaign Davis's Cross Roads.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863]]\nBragg intended to attack General James S. Negley's isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army at that location. He ordered the divisions of Thomas Hindman and Patrick Cleburne to concentrate together and launch a joint attack under Hindman's command. Due to delays in conveying orders, Cleburne's division failed to arrive in time on the 10th, while Thomas reinforced the isolated division with the rest of his corps including the Lightning Brigade. After the two divisions were united the next day, they failed to launch a coordinated attack on Thomas' positions and were repulsed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nJust before the start of the battle, on 18 Spetember, the Lightning Brigade played a crucial role. At Alexander's Bridge to the south, the brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007).

The species is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and inhabits [[Old-growth forest|primary]] and [[secondary forest]]s, including seasonally inundated [[swamp forest]]s.

Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]] and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat.

The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.\n\nActing on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society\u2019s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | title = Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee}}</ref>\n\nWith grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the Zoological Society also has been working to:\n*Survey the bonobo population and its habitat to find ways to help protect these apes\n*Develop antipoaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo's Salonga National Park, a UN World Heritage site\n*Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes \u2013 the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.\n*Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo\n\nStarting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.<ref>Chapin, Mac, (November/December 2004), [http://watha.org/in-depth/EP176A.pdf Vision for a Sustainable World], WORLDWATCH magazine</ref>\n\nThe bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [[African Wildlife Foundation]], and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Basankusu]], DR Congo \u2013 base for bonobo research and conservation\n* [[Bonobo Conservation Initiative]]\n* [[Chimpanzee genome project]]\n* [[Claudine Andr\u00e9]]\n* [[Great ape personhood]]\n* [[Great Ape Project]]\n* [[Kanzi]] \u2013 a captive bonobo who uses language\n* [[List of apes]] \u2013 notable individual nonhuman apes\n* [[Lola ya Bonobo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- CurrBiol17:619,17:1663. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Books===\n* [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, Frans]], and [[Frans Lanting]], ''Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape'', [[University of California Press]], 1997. {{ISBN|0-520-20535-9}}; {{ISBN|0-520-21651-2}} (trade paperback)\n* [[Takayoshi Kano|Kano, Takayoshi]], ''The Last Ape: Pygmy Chimpanzee Behavior and Ecology,'' Stanford, CA: [[Stanford University Press]], 1992.\n* [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh|Savage-Rumbaugh, Sue]], and [[Roger Lewin]], ''Kanzi: The Ape at the Brink of the Human Mind'', [[John Wiley & Sons|John Wiley]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-471-58591-2}}; {{ISBN|0-471-15959-X}} (trade paperback)\n* [[Vanessa Woods|Woods, Vanessa]], ''Bonobo Handshake'', Gotham Books, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-59240-546-6}}\n* Sandin, Jo, ''Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy'', Zoological Society of Milwaukee & The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc., 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9794151-0-4}}\n* [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, Frans]], ''The Bonobo and the Atheist'', [[W.

The bonobo is found in a {{Convert|500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area of the [[Congo Basin]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Central Africa. The species is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and inhabits [[Old-growth forest|primary]] and [[secondary forest]]s, including seasonally inundated [[swamp forest]]s. Because of political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos, there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.\n\nAlong with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to [[human]]s.<ref name=\"NYT-20160910\" /> As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the [[Congo River]] 1.5\u20132 million years ago possibly led to the [[speciation]] of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]] and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. Bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but is almost certainly much shorter.<ref>Rowe, N.

The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.\n\nActing on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society\u2019s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | title = Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee}}</ref>\n\nWith grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the Zoological Society also has been working to:\n*Survey the bonobo population and its habitat to find ways to help protect these apes\n*Develop antipoaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo's Salonga National Park, a UN World Heritage site\n*Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes \u2013 the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.\n*Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo\n\nStarting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.<ref>Chapin, Mac, (November/December 2004), [http://watha.org/in-depth/EP176A.pdf Vision for a Sustainable World], WORLDWATCH magazine</ref>\n\nThe bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [[African Wildlife Foundation]], and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Basankusu]], DR Congo \u2013 base for bonobo research and conservation\n* [[Bonobo Conservation Initiative]]\n* [[Chimpanzee genome project]]\n* [[Claudine Andr\u00e9]]\n* [[Great ape personhood]]\n* [[Great Ape Project]]\n* [[Kanzi]] \u2013 a captive bonobo who uses language\n* [[List of apes]] \u2013 notable individual nonhuman apes\n* [[Lola ya Bonobo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- CurrBiol17:619,17:1663. -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Books===\n* [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, Frans]], and [[Frans Lanting]], ''Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape'', [[University of California Press]], 1997. {{ISBN|0-520-20535-9}}; {{ISBN|0-520-21651-2}} (trade paperback)\n* [[Takayoshi Kano|Kano, Takayoshi]], ''The Last Ape: Pygmy Chimpanzee Behavior and Ecology,'' Stanford, CA: [[Stanford University Press]], 1992.\n* [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh|Savage-Rumbaugh, Sue]], and [[Roger Lewin]], ''Kanzi: The Ape at the Brink of the Human Mind'', [[John Wiley & Sons|John Wiley]], 1994. {{ISBN|0-471-58591-2}}; {{ISBN|0-471-15959-X}} (trade paperback)\n* [[Vanessa Woods|Woods, Vanessa]], ''Bonobo Handshake'', Gotham Books, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-59240-546-6}}\n* Sandin, Jo, ''Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy'', Zoological Society of Milwaukee & The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc., 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9794151-0-4}}\n* [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, Frans]], ''The Bonobo and the Atheist'', [[W.

The last renaming took place in 1924 after King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who had taken the ''[[Pseudonym#Noms de guerre|nom de guerre]]'' \"Mrkonji\u0107\" while fighting in the uprising (1875\u201378) against the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435 (\u041c. \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434).jpg|thumb|right|Church of Saint Sava]]\n[[Image:\u0422\u0432\u0440\u0452\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0446 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bo\u010dac fortress]]\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Mrkonji\u0107 Grad was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn [[World War II]], the town became renowned by the first meeting of [[ZAVNOBiH]] on 25 November 1943, when Bosnia and Herzegovina was proclaimed as a common republic of [[Bosnian Serbs|Serbs]], [[Bosnian Croats|Croats]] and [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]].\n\nDuring the Bosnian War from 1992 to 1995, the town was within the territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs. The town is also known for the [[Mrkonji\u0107 Grad incident]] where the USAF lost one F-16 in June 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307200103/http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/DenyFlight/DenyFlightFactSheet.htm|title=AFSOUTH Fact sheets|date=2011-03-07|work=AF South Nato|access-date=2016-08-06}}</ref>{{cbignore}} The pilot of the jet, [[Scott O'Grady]], was stranded in the area for six days before being rescued by [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]].

The embedded cis-acting elements devoted to coronavirus replication constitute a small fraction of the total genome, but this is presumed to be a reflection of the fact that coronaviruses have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses. The boundaries of cis-acting elements essential to replication are fairly well-defined, and the [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|RNA secondary structures]] of these regions are understood. However, how these cis-acting structures and sequences interact with the viral replicase and host cell components to allow RNA synthesis is not well understood.<ref name=Thiel>{{cite book | author = Thiel V (editor) | title = Coronaviruses: Molecular and Cellular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cor | isbn = 978-1-904455-16-5}}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"groot\"/>\n\n== Genome packaging ==\n\nThe assembly of infectious coronavirus particles requires the selection of viral genomic RNA from a cellular pool that contains an abundant excess of non-viral and viral RNAs. Among the seven to ten specific viral mRNAs synthesized in virus-infected cells, only the full-length genomic RNA is packaged efficiently into coronavirus particles. Studies have revealed cis-acting elements and trans-acting viral factors involved in the coronavirus genome [[encapsidation]] and packaging. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of genome selection and packaging is critical for developing antiviral strategies and viral expression vectors based on the coronavirus genome.<ref name=Thiel/><ref name=\"groot\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Medicine|Viruses}}\n* [[Bat-borne virus]]\n* [[Zoonosis]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{Commons category|Coronaviridae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Orthocoronavirinae}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Alwan A, Mahjour J, Memish ZA | title = Novel coronavirus infection: time to stay ahead of the curve | journal = Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal = La Revue De Sante De La Mediterranee Orientale = Al-Majallah Al-Sihhiyah Li-Sharq Al-Mutawassit | volume = 19 Suppl 1 | pages = S3\u20134 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23888787 | doi = 10.26719/2013.19.supp1.S3 | url = http://www.emro.who.int/emhj-volume-19-2013/volume-19-supplement-1-coronavirus/volume-19-supplement-1-coronavirus.htm }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Laude H, Rasschaert D, Delmas B, Godet M, Gelfi J, Charley B | title = Molecular biology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 23 | issue = 1-4 | pages = 147\u201354 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2169670 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1135(90)90144-K }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Sola I, Alonso S, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga S, Balasch M, Plana-Dur\u00e1n J, Enjuanes L | title = Engineering the transmissible gastroenteritis virus genome as an expression vector inducing lactogenic immunity | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 77 | issue = 7 | pages = 4357\u201369 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12634392 | pmc = 150661 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.77.7.4357-4369.2003 }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Tajima M | title = Morphology of transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs.
