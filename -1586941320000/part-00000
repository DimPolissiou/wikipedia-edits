2007) was a British politician, diplomat and businessman.\n\nLord Jellicoe was the only son but sixth and youngest child of [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe]], who was a [[First World War]] naval commander, commander at the Battle of [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]], and [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]], and his wife Florence Gwendoline (died 1964), who was the second daughter of [[Sir Charles Cayzer, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Cayzer]], 1st [[Baronet|Bt.]], of [[Gartmore]], [[Perthshire]]. George Jellicoe was one of the longest-serving parliamentarians in the world, being a member of the [[House of Lords]] for 68 years (1939\u20132007).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Early life==\nJellicoe was born at Hatfield and was christened on 29 July 1918 by the [[Most Reverend|Most Rev.]] and [[The Right Honourable|Right Hon.]] [[Cosmo Lang]], 89th [[Archbishop of York]], while [[George V of Great Britain and Ireland|King George V]] (represented by [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Stanley Colville|Sir Stanley Colville]]) and HRH [[Princess Patricia of Connaught]] (later known as Lady Patricia Ramsay) stood sponsor as two of his godparents. The others were: Miss Lilian Lear, Admiral [[Lionel Halsey|Sir Lionel Halsey]] (Third Sea Lord), Mr. Eustace Burrows (cousin), [[Baron Rotherwick|Major Herbert Cayzer]] (uncle), and [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] Frederick G. G. Jellicoe (uncle, and Rector of [[New Alresford]]).\n\nMuch of his childhood was spent at St Lawrence Hall, near [[Ventnor]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]; at [[St Peter's Court]], a prep school at [[Broadstairs]], Kent; in London; and in the [[Dominion of New Zealand]], where his father was [[viceroy]] with the title of [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] between 1921 and 1924. He was educated at [[Winchester College]], where he was styled and known as [[Earl Jellicoe|Viscount Brocas]]. He won the Vere Herbert Smith history prize and secured an exhibition to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (matriculated 1936. BA, Modern History tripos 1939, but awarded 1966). He was chairman of the [[Pitt Club]], and his tutor [[Steven Runciman]] became a lifelong friend.\n\n==Second World War==\nIn October 1939, the young Jellicoe was a cadet in the first wartime intake at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|RMC, Sandhurst]].<ref>Windmill, Lorna Almonds.

He served with '' L Detachment'' (from April 1942) (with some of the above and [[Stephen Hastings]]), which was the nucleus of the [[Special Air Service]]. He was [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in despatches]] thrice, and wounded (bullet in shoulder) once whilst with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, in 22 (Guards) Brigade in the Western Desert in January 1941. He won the DSO in November 1942 for [[Operation Albumen|operating on a raid]] that claimed to have blown up more than 20 German aircraft ([[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88s]]) on [[Heraklion]] airfield, Crete, that June:\n<blockquote>\nHis cool and resolute leadership, skill and courage throughout this very hazardous operation were mainly responsible for the high measure of success achieved. He&nbsp;... placed charges on the enemy aircraft and brought off the survivors after the four [[Free French Forces|Free French]] members of the party had been betrayed and killed or captured.<ref>''[[London Gazette]]'', 5 November 1942, quoted from L. Almonds Windmill, page 49</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn September 1943, Jellicoe was sent to the Italian-held island of [[Rhodes]] to negotiate with the Italian Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]] for the surrender of his forces to the Allies. However, negotiations were pre-empted by a surprise German attack on the island on 9 September. He was able to escape from Rhodes during the resulting chaos while the Italian garrison was captured by the German invasion force. This was part of the [[Dodecanese Campaign]].\n\nIn 1943, he was named Commander of the [[Special Boat Service|Special Boat Regiment ''Middle East'']] and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was eventually promoted to brigadier.<ref>Churchill's secret warriors. Damien Lewis 2014.</ref> For the remainder of the war, his SBS command conducted secretive and dangerous operations along the coasts of Italy and Yugoslavia. In 1944, he won the MC for one of these actions. At the end of the war, Jellicoe was among the first Allied soldiers to enter German-occupied [[Athens]], beating the communist-controlled guerrillas [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]], to create a pro-Allied presence in the capital.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2300414.ece |date=24 February 2007 |title=Earl Jellicoe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119112513/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2300414.ece |archive-date=19 November 2007 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] }}</ref>\n\nYears later, when First Lord of the Admiralty, Jellicoe told at least one reporter, \"The only serious military distinction I ever achieved was having a new type of assault boat named after me. It was called I am ashamed to say, the Jellicoe Inflatable Intruder Mark One.\"\n\nIn March 1944, Lord Jellicoe married Patricia Christine O'Kane (October 1917 \u2013 March 2012),<ref>{{cite web|title=Patricia Christine Jellicoe (n\u00e9e O'Kane), Countess Jellicoe (1917\u20132012)|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp85238/patricia-christine-jellicoe-nee-okane-countess-jellicoe|publisher=National Portrait Gallery}}</ref> who was employed at the [[British Embassy]] in [[Beirut]]. She had been born and raised in [[Shanghai]] and was the daughter of a [[Greenock]]-born Irish father and an English mother. Patricia, Countess Jellicoe (popularly known as Patsy Jellicoe), would remain married to Lord Jellicoe until 1966, when they divorced. They had two sons and two daughters together, the eldest son being the [[Earl Jellicoe|3rd Earl Jellicoe]].\n\n==HM Foreign Service 1947\u20131958==\nSoon after the war Lord Jellicoe joined His Majesty's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Service]], (appointed a Foreign Service Officer, Grade 8 in the Senior Branch of the Foreign Service, 10 September 1947). He served in London (German political department, Third Secretary); [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (Third Secretary, when [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]] of the [[Cambridge Five|''Cambridge five'']] was Head of Chancery, and then as one of the 11 Second Secretaries with [[Kim Philby|H. A. R. Philby]], seeing [[NATO]] signed on 4 April 1949, all when [[Oliver Franks, Baron Franks|Sir Oliver Franks]] was Ambassador); transferred to [[Brussels]] 10 September 1951 (Head of Chancery) acted as Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in 1952); London (no. 2 in Northern department in charge of the Soviet Desk from September 1953); and Baghdad from January 1956 (First Secretary and Deputy Secretary General of [[Baghdad Pact|the Baghdad Pact]] Organisation). The [[Suez Crisis]] (from July 1956) wrecked everything the Pact was trying to achieve; Jellicoe was appalled by British policy and came close to resigning (L. Windmill p.&nbsp;136).\n\nJellicoe eventually left the Foreign Office in March 1958, after marital difficulties had caused an impasse (February 1958, [[Permanent Secretary]] Sir Derek Hoyar-Millar wrote; 'You have a choice of ceasing your relationship with this lady [Philippa Dunne] or changing your job'). He became a director of the Cayzer dynasty's [[Clan Line]] Steamers (cargo ships), and [[Union-Castle Line|Union Castle Steamship Co.]] (passengers).\n\nHowever, enthusiasm for his mother's family's businesses ultimately gave way to the call of the [[Palace of Westminster]], where, back from [[Iraq]], he took the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath]] in the [[House of Lords|Lords]] on 3 December 1957, in the Third Session of the [[41st Parliament of the United Kingdom|41st Parliament]].\n\n==House of Lords and 1960s==\n[[File:JellicoeGrin.jpg|thumb|Jellicoe during a skiing holiday.]]\n[[File:JellicoeSkiing.jpg|thumb|Jellicoe skiing in France.]]\nHaving first sat in parliament on 25 July 1939, Jellicoe waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech in the [[House of Lords]] during a debate entitled \"The International Situation: The Middle East\". He spoke from the [[cross-bencher|Cross-Benches]] about the Baghdad Pact and Iraq:\n{{quote|...&nbsp;Having lately lived for a year or so in [[Baghdad]] I confess that I have not been untouched by the charm of that ugly yet fascinating city, and, if I may say so, of the diverse peoples of Iraq&nbsp;... Like all your Lordships, I felt, and feel, a deep sense of shock, indeed revulsion, at the brutal butchery of the young King and his family, and of that great, and greatly human, statesman, [[Nuri as-Said|Nuri Pasha]]. I have also been shocked by the tendency which one sees current at the moment to write off the Nuri regime as decadent, feudal and corrupt. That picture, in my view, is a travesty of the truth&nbsp;... As part of the admirable development programme which the Nuri regime was carrying through there was a large schools programme. These schools were built for the purpose your Lordships might expect-to educate Iraqis in. But the Iraqis did not believe that; they thought-it was a very widespread belief which one could not eradicate-that these schools were camouflaged barracks intended for the British Army when they reoccupied Iraq. These are the sorts of 'ingrowing toenails' in the Iraqi consciousness which I feel we must try to eradicate, to draw out&nbsp;...}}\n\nBy October 1958 he had joined the Conservatives, in the Lords a natural home for such a ''distinctly pink''<ref>[[Piers Dixon]] in Philip Ziegler & Desmond Seward (eds): ''Brooks's: A Social History'', 1991.</ref>{{clarification needed|date=May 2019}} [[British Whig Party|Whig]], who gave him the honour of moving \"an humble Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech\"\n{{quote|My Lords, I am acutely, indeed somewhat painfully, conscious of the great honour which the noble Earl [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]]'' (i.e. Alec Douglas-Home)'', the Leader of the House, has done me in inviting me to move the humble Address to Her Majesty. The last time that I addressed your Lordships' House was from the platonic sanctity of the Cross-Benches. I then had the aesthetic pleasure of seeing your Lordships in profile: I now have the equal pleasure of seeing some of your Lordships full face. I do not know why I find myself in this particular hot spot this afternoon. I can only surmise that the noble Earl, fishing for a good large Tory trout, cast over the Cross-Benches for an ex-Ambassador and hooked an ex-First Secretary by mistake.}}\n\nOn 7 May 1959, he asked a prescient starred question on the Planning of Motorways:\n{{quote|...&nbsp;Just as the Roman roads are with us to-day, so these great new roads may be with our successors 1,000 years hence. With this in mind, can my noble friend assure us, first, that the advice of the Advisory Committee [on the Landscape Treatment of Trunk Roads] to which he referred will in all cases in future be sought at a very early stage in the planning of these new roads;  and, secondly, that permanent professional advice will be enlisted from the outset at the planning, the reconnaissance stage, in order to ensure that these great new roads blend as harmoniously as possible with the land-scape through which they pass?}}\n\nOn 20 July 1959 he initiated a debate on ''Western Aid for Uncommitted Countries'', and by January 1961 he was a [[Lord-in-waiting]] to H.M. the Queen, a Government Whip, in [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]]'s administration. He was Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Local Government June 1961 \u2013 July 1962; Minister of State, Home Office July 1962 \u2013 October 1963; [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] October 1963 \u2013 April 1964; [[Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy]] April\u2013October 1964; delegate to the [[Council of Europe]] and the Western European Union (WEU) 1965\u20131967; president of the National Federation of Housing Societies 1965\u20131970; a governor of the [[Centre for Environmental Studies]] 1967\u20131970; chairman of the British Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution at Sea 1968; chairman of the third International Conference on oil pollution of the sea 1968; an hon. vice-president of [[Tory Reform Group|PEST]] (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism); and deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Lords 1967\u20131970. From April 1967 Lords Jellicoe and [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Carrington]] represented the Conservatives in the Lords on the Inter-Party conference group on Lords' reform, which came up with the unsuccessful Parliament (No.2) Bill (1968\u20131969). Leading the debate for the (Conservative) Opposition in November 1968 Jellicoe said:\n{{quote|We hold that a grave constitutional change of this kind should not be brought into effect in the dying years of a discredited Government&nbsp;... a viable Upper House has an essential part to play in our parliamentary structure. We now have a quite considerable constitutional prize in our grasp, the opportunity to build a really viable Upper House on the basis of a broad consensus of support from all Parties&nbsp;... (19 November 1968, Hansard via L. Windmill).}}\n\nDuring the late 1960s he worked in the [[City of London]] where he became chairman of British Reserve Insurance and a director of [[S. G. Warburg & Co.|S G Warburg (Finance and Development) Ltd]].\n\n==Cabinet minister and resignation==\nIn [[Edward Heath|Ted Heath's]] [[Conservative Government 1970-1974|administration]] he was Minister in charge for the Civil Service Department (CSD), [[Lord Privy Seal]] (as such he was eighth on the [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|Roll of The Lords]]) and [[Leader of the House of Lords]] from 20 June 1970 until 24 May 1973.\n\nHaving earlier re-established relations with the miners' union leaders in February 1972, Heath appointed Jellicoe \"energy supremo\" to restore power supplies around the time of the [[Three-Day Week]] and had him set up and chair a Civil Contingencies Unit, which was, when an internal crisis arose, to operate through \"COBRA\" ([[Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms]]).\n\nIn June 1972 Jellicoe was sent to lead [[Concorde]]'s first sales expedition. As Alan Trengove in ''My Lord, the super salesman'', in the Australian ''The Sun'' of 22 June 1972 put it,\n{{quote|There has probably never been a sales team [122 strong] quite like the aristocratic British contingent that is trying to sell the Anglo-French supersonic Concorde to Qantas&nbsp;... The earl is an astute salesman who has obviously done his homework&nbsp;... He has the stamina to address a couple of press conferences each day as well as make daily speeches&nbsp;... cultivate politicians, DCA personnel and Qantas bosses. At fifty-four, the earl looks a rugged character. He has a strong broad chin and speaks with a directness that appeals to Australians&nbsp;... Inevitably, he is beginning to be known in Australia as 'Aeroplane Jellicoe'. If he can land the Concorde deal with Qantas, they may soon be singing in Britain:\n::''I like Aeroplane Jellicoe''\n::''Aeroplane Jellicoe for me.''\n::''I like it for dinner, like it for tea,''\n::''Aeroplane Jellicoe has goodness for me''.}}\n\nTrengove considered [[George Edwards (aviation)|Sir George Edwards]] and Sir Geoffrey Tuttle \"equally impressive members of the sales team\". (Supersonic flights were on the prototype Concorde G-BSST, certificate signed by [[Brian Trubshaw]], and dated 15 June 1972). Jellicoe, with the help of his very experienced Chief Whip, the second [[Earl St Aldwyn|Earl St. Aldwyn]], steered the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|''European Communities Act'' (1972)]] through the Lords, allowing no amendments. The ''Industrial Relations Act'' was another legislative highlight.\n\nIn May 1973 Jellicoe admitted \"some casual affairs\" with [[call girl]]s (from ''Mayfair Escorts'') in the wake of an accidental confusion with [[Antony Lambton|Lord Lambton]]'s prostitution scandal.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alvin |last=Shuster |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/27/archives/a-proper-government-scandal-britain.html |title=A Proper Government Scandal; Britain |date=27 May 1973 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref> The name Jellicoe seems to have emerged as a result of a connection between Lambton, the madame Norma Levy, and a tenement house or community hall in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] in the London district of St. Pancras called ''Jellicoe'' Hall or House, after Basil Jellicoe (1899\u20131935) the housing reformer, and priest. The word Jellicoe was seen in Levy's notebook, and a connection was assumed to the Minister rather than the building; a structure named after the earl's distant cousin, and one that may have been opened by the Admiral himself in June 1928.\n\nThe resignation ended Jellicoe's third career in government service. After the resignation (over his marginal involvement in a minor indiscretion) [[Richard Crossman]], writing in ''The Times'', 30 May 1973 (page 18), described Jellicoe as:\n{{quote|...&nbsp;among the bravest, ablest, most decent members of the Heath Government&nbsp;... [B]ut need the Prime Minister have got rid of Lord Jellicoe in such peremptory style? Could he not have refused his resignation until all the facts were available?}}\n\nOn return from the Whitsun recess, tributes were paid in the Lords to their departed leader: The (Labour Party) Opposition leader and Jellicoe's predecessor as Lord Privy Seal, [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]] said:\n{{quote|Lord Jellicoe&nbsp;... has been as good a leader of this House as we have known [cheers].. I don't think we can let him go \u2013 though happily this is not an epitaph \u2013 without expressing our very deep sorrow to the House and to the country [cheers]&nbsp;... with immense thoroughness, patience and personal sensitivity Lord Jellicoe fulfilled his role as Leader of your Lordships House [cheers]&nbsp;... we [Lords Byers and Shackleton] found him an admirable open-minded and wise colleague; my Lords, I believe that we and the country have suffered a grievous loss&nbsp;... (Hansard, 5 June 1973, and ''The Times'', 6 June 1973, for the cheers)}}\n\nLord Byers for the Liberal Party added: \"we regret bitterly his resignation&nbsp;... He was a reforming innovator and the House owes a great deal more than it probably knows to the interest he took in this House and to his initiatives.\" (Hansard, 5 June 1973)\n\nFrom the Cross-Benches [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang|Lord Strang]] added:\n{{quote|To some of us it had been a comfort to have had Lord Jellicoe as Leader. I doubt whether he realises how much we shall miss him. We have been deeply saddened by what has happened. The outstanding record of his achievements will not be dimmed; our warm regard for him will remain. (Hansard, 5 June 1973)}}\n\nWilliam Kendall, general secretary of the [[Civil and Public Services Association]] said:\n{{quote|In our union we respected him as a tough, capable and fair negotiator'' (quoted from ''The Times'', 25 May 1973, page 2); or, as Daniel McGeachie (of ''The Daily Express'') reported on 25 May 1973, ''He was a man in the Macmillan mould&nbsp;... [H]e gave the impression of a solid and straightforward approach to life, to the cut and thrust of debate-but at the same time he was an extraordinarlily subtle person.}}\n\nIn July 1973 the [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Diplock]] Commission, which had been set up to look into the security implications of Lambton and Jellicoe's adventures, concluded its section on Jellicoe (paragraph 24):\n{{quote|...&nbsp;it was Lord Jellicoe's misfortune that his use of 'call girls' happened to come to light at the particular moment that it did, when the attention of the Press was focused on the private conduct of Ministers in connection with the entirely separate case of Lord Lambton.}}\n\n==Business and post-government public career==\nLoss of government office soon seemed somewhat serendipitous. With no estates to distract him Jellicoe was free to re-join [[S. G. Warburg & Co.]] (1 October 1973), and with the help of [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]], who was soon to retire from the board, he became a non-executive director of the sugar company [[Tate & Lyle]] 1973\u20131993. Thanks in the main to Sir Saxon Tate, and presumedly because he had succeeded as chairman (until June 1978) of their subsidiary Tunnel Refineries, the family made him Tate & Lyle's first non-family chairman 1978\u20131983. Having revived and retrenched Tate & Lyle Jellicoe became chairman of Booker Tate, 1988\u201391.\n\nOther non-governmental jobs include: chairman of engineering plant company the Davy Corporation (Davy McKee) (now subsumed into [[Aker Kv\u00e6rner]]) 1985\u20131990; director [[Sotheby's]] Holdings 1973\u20131993; Morgan Crucible 1974\u201388; [[Smiths Group|Smiths Industries Ltd]] 1973\u20131986; S. G. Warburg & Co 1964\u20131970, 1973\u20131988. He was president of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1979\u20131982. He succeeded [[Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick|Lord Limerick]] as chairman of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]'s [[British Overseas Trade Board]] (BOTB) 1983\u20131986, for which he was knighted. That was followed by chairmanship (1986\u20131990) and then the presidency (1990\u20131995) of the East European Trade Council (EETC). He was chairman of the Greek Fund Ltd 1988\u20131994 ([[Schroders]]) and of European Capital Ltd 1991\u20131995.\n\nLord Jellicoe was chairman of the council of [[King's College London]] (KCL) 1974\u20131983; chairman of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) 1982\u20131990; a trustee of the National Aids Trust (alongside the likes of [[Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman|Lord Goodman]], [[David Puttnam]] and [[Robert Maxwell]]);\npresident of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) (and of the Institute of British Geographers (IBG) after amalgamation) 1993\u20131997; president of the [[Anglo-Hellenic League]] 1978\u20131986; president of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] Trust 1987\u20131994; president of the UK [[Crete]] Veterans Association 1991\u20132001; president of the [[British Heart Foundation]] (BHF) 1992\u20131995; [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Southampton University]] 1984\u20131995, and has been closely associated with research and higher education. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1990.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nIn 1995 he helped found [[Hakluyt & Company]], a strategic intelligence and advisory firm, for which he was a director 1996\u20132000. He was president of the SAS Regimental Association 1996\u20132000, when he became its patron. Jellicoe was a member of the Onassis International Prizes Committee (1983\u20131992); a vice-president of The European-Atlantic Group and of the [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron Society]]; he was on the board of the Hellenic College London; patron of the City of Southampton Society; a patron of the Greek Archaeological Committee (UK); one of five patrons of The Community Foundation for Wiltshire and Swindon; a director of The Landscape Foundation (now dormant); patron of Friends of The Royal Hospital School; patron of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology; a member of the World Innovation Fund (WIF) and an associate member of INEED.{{Clarify|name of organization|date=January 2018}} In 2002 he became a patron of ''The Second World War Experience Centre'' in [[Leeds]].\n\n==Later state contributions==\nBack in the Lords and affairs of state; he was chairman of the Select Committee on Committees (1990\u20131993) and President of the [[Parliamentary and Scientific Committee]] (1980\u20131983). In 1983 he was author of the '''Jellicoe Report''' which reviewed the ''Operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976''. ''The Times'' saw this appointment as the end of nine years penance in the political wilderness.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1973 Jellicoe had averaged 90 House of Lords daily attendances per parliamentary session. From 1973 to 1989 his attendance plummeted to a meagre average of nine appearances per session. However, between 1990 and 2001 he turned up a conscientious average of 72 visits per session. He maintained this rate until early 2006, though Jellicoe's last full speech in the Lords was made as part of the ''Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech'' (the Queen's Speech debate) on 28 October 1996, his subject was [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo961028/text/61028-06.htm#61028-06_spnew0|title=Lords Hansard text for 28 Oct 1996 (161028-06) |publisher=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords, Westminster }}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed his hereditary automatic entitlement to attend and sit in the House of Lords, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Jellicoe of Southampton''', of [[Southampton]] in the County of Hampshire, so that he could continue to be summoned<blockquote>1. Earl Jellicoe (Lord Jellicoe of Southampton) \u2014The Rt Hon. George Patrick John Rushworth Earl Jellicoe, having been created Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, for life by Letters Patent dated 6 o'clock in the forenoon of 17th&nbsp;November 1999, took and subscribed the oath pursuant to statute.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55676 |page=12465 |date=23 November 1999 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLord Jellicoe remained an active member of the House of Lords for the rest of his life. He died on 22 February 2007, six weeks shy of his 89th birthday.\n\nAt his death, Lord Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, and arguably the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having succeeded his father on 20 November 1935 and come of age and sat first in parliament on 25 July 1939. Because he waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech, a few peers (viz. [[Robert Shirley, 13th Earl Ferrers|Earl Ferrers]] and [[David Renton, Baron Renton|Lords Renton]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Carrington]], [[Denis Healey|Healey]], and [[David Kenworthy, 11th Baron Strabolgi|Strabolgi]]) could have been considered to have been active parliamentarians longer. Moreover, at the time of his death, on the Privy Council only the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] (1951) and Lords [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Carrington]] (1959), [[Bill Deedes|Deedes]] and [[David Renton, Baron Renton|Renton]] (both 1962) had served longer.\n\n==Character==\nIn May 1973, at the time of his resignation from the government, friends are quoted as saying:\n{{quote|If he has a fault it is because he wears his weaknesses on his sleeve. He is too frank. I suppose though, that is no bad thing. He was not flamboyant but he was a hedonist. He is the sort of non-pompous person who does not try to hide his weaknesses. (quoted from Christopher Sweeney's article in ''The Times'', 25 May 1973, page 2)}}\n\nIn July 1970, as one of the first people to be [[Breathalyzer|breathalized]], he was banned from driving for a year and fined 75 pounds with 20 guineas costs for ''having consumed more than the permitted level of alcohol'' in Old Brompton Road at 4 a.m. on 21 March 1970. The trouble was that his new [[Reliant Scimitar]] had a stiff gearbox, or so his story went. Luck saw to it that the case came after the General Election and the ban coincided with the arrival of his right to a full-time government car. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 2000, his friend, the former [[British Ambassador to the United States]], [[Nicholas Henderson|Sir Nicholas Henderson]], wrote:\n{{quote|George is a man of moods. He is not complicated but a many-sided character. There are in fact four Georges: there is George the First, the unabstemious, boisterous [[Lothario]], with a leer like a rou\u00e9 in a [[Peter Arno]] cartoon, blessed with an iron constitution and athletic prowess that enabled him to have been on the verge of the British Olympic ski and sleigh teams; then we have Hero George, the dashing man of action, a leader who whether descending by parachute or commanding by sea, kept the enemy on tenterhooks in the Eastern Mediterranean throughout the war; thirdly, there is George the aesthete and sightseer, who, with little finger raised, will speak discerningly of paintings, mosaics and furniture, a great patron of the arts, his talent as a collector manqu\u00e9 only due to lack of funds, which has not prevented some bold purchases; and finally we have pensive George, scholar and public servant, concerned to promote the national interest, high-minded, cautious and conscientious&nbsp;... [A] striking and irrepressible feature of that character has been his easy communion with members of the opposite sex, and this may have been prefigured by an early experience. He spent some time as a small boy in New Zealand where his father was Governor-General. George wanted to become a [[cub scout|wolf cub]], but no pack was available, so instead he joined the [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]]. He got on very well with them.

He won the Vere Herbert Smith history prize and secured an exhibition to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (matriculated 1936. BA, Modern History tripos 1939, but awarded 1966). He was chairman of the [[Pitt Club]], and his tutor [[Steven Runciman]] became a lifelong friend.\n\n==Second World War==\nIn October 1939, the young Jellicoe was a cadet in the first wartime intake at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|RMC, Sandhurst]].<ref>Windmill, Lorna Almonds.

He served with '' L Detachment'' (from April 1942) (with some of the above and [[Stephen Hastings]]), which was the nucleus of the [[Special Air Service]]. He was [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in despatches]] thrice, and wounded (bullet in shoulder) once whilst with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, in 22 (Guards) Brigade in the Western Desert in January 1941. He won the DSO in November 1942 for [[Operation Albumen|operating on a raid]] that claimed to have blown up more than 20 German aircraft ([[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88s]]) on [[Heraklion]] airfield, Crete, that June:\n<blockquote>\nHis cool and resolute leadership, skill and courage throughout this very hazardous operation were mainly responsible for the high measure of success achieved.

However, negotiations were pre-empted by a surprise German attack on the island on 9 September. He was able to escape from Rhodes during the resulting chaos while the Italian garrison was captured by the German invasion force. This was part of the [[Dodecanese Campaign]].\n\nIn 1943, he was named Commander of the [[Special Boat Service|Special Boat Regiment ''Middle East'']] and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was eventually promoted to brigadier.<ref>Churchill's secret warriors. Damien Lewis 2014.</ref> For the remainder of the war, his SBS command conducted secretive and dangerous operations along the coasts of Italy and Yugoslavia. In 1944, he won the MC for one of these actions.

She had been born and raised in [[Shanghai]] and was the daughter of a [[Greenock]]-born Irish father and an English mother. Patricia, Countess Jellicoe (popularly known as Patsy Jellicoe), would remain married to Lord Jellicoe until 1966, when they divorced. They had two sons and two daughters together, the eldest son being the [[Earl Jellicoe|3rd Earl Jellicoe]].\n\n==HM Foreign Service 1947\u20131958==\nSoon after the war Lord Jellicoe joined His Majesty's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Service]], (appointed a Foreign Service Officer, Grade 8 in the Senior Branch of the Foreign Service, 10 September 1947). He served in London (German political department, Third Secretary); [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (Third Secretary, when [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]] of the [[Cambridge Five|''Cambridge five'']] was Head of Chancery, and then as one of the 11 Second Secretaries with [[Kim Philby|H.

The [[Suez Crisis]] (from July 1956) wrecked everything the Pact was trying to achieve; Jellicoe was appalled by British policy and came close to resigning (L. Windmill p.&nbsp;136).\n\nJellicoe eventually left the Foreign Office in March 1958, after marital difficulties had caused an impasse (February 1958, [[Permanent Secretary]] Sir Derek Hoyar-Millar wrote; 'You have a choice of ceasing your relationship with this lady [Philippa Dunne] or changing your job'). He became a director of the Cayzer dynasty's [[Clan Line]] Steamers (cargo ships), and [[Union-Castle Line|Union Castle Steamship Co.]] (passengers).\n\nHowever, enthusiasm for his mother's family's businesses ultimately gave way to the call of the [[Palace of Westminster]], where, back from [[Iraq]], he took the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath]] in the [[House of Lords|Lords]] on 3 December 1957, in the Third Session of the [[41st Parliament of the United Kingdom|41st Parliament]].\n\n==House of Lords and 1960s==\n[[File:JellicoeGrin.jpg|thumb|Jellicoe during a skiing holiday.]]\n[[File:JellicoeSkiing.jpg|thumb|Jellicoe skiing in France.]]\nHaving first sat in parliament on 25 July 1939, Jellicoe waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech in the [[House of Lords]] during a debate entitled \"The International Situation: The Middle East\". He spoke from the [[cross-bencher|Cross-Benches]] about the Baghdad Pact and Iraq:\n{{quote|...&nbsp;Having lately lived for a year or so in [[Baghdad]] I confess that I have not been untouched by the charm of that ugly yet fascinating city, and, if I may say so, of the diverse peoples of Iraq&nbsp;... Like all your Lordships, I felt, and feel, a deep sense of shock, indeed revulsion, at the brutal butchery of the young King and his family, and of that great, and greatly human, statesman, [[Nuri as-Said|Nuri Pasha]]. I have also been shocked by the tendency which one sees current at the moment to write off the Nuri regime as decadent, feudal and corrupt. That picture, in my view, is a travesty of the truth&nbsp;... As part of the admirable development programme which the Nuri regime was carrying through there was a large schools programme. These schools were built for the purpose your Lordships might expect-to educate Iraqis in. But the Iraqis did not believe that; they thought-it was a very widespread belief which one could not eradicate-that these schools were camouflaged barracks intended for the British Army when they reoccupied Iraq. These are the sorts of 'ingrowing toenails' in the Iraqi consciousness which I feel we must try to eradicate, to draw out&nbsp;...}}\n\nBy October 1958 he had joined the Conservatives, in the Lords a natural home for such a ''distinctly pink''<ref>[[Piers Dixon]] in Philip Ziegler & Desmond Seward (eds): ''Brooks's: A Social History'', 1991.</ref>{{clarification needed|date=May 2019}} [[British Whig Party|Whig]], who gave him the honour of moving \"an humble Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech\"\n{{quote|My Lords, I am acutely, indeed somewhat painfully, conscious of the great honour which the noble Earl [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]]'' (i.e. Alec Douglas-Home)'', the Leader of the House, has done me in inviting me to move the humble Address to Her Majesty.

I can only surmise that the noble Earl, fishing for a good large Tory trout, cast over the Cross-Benches for an ex-Ambassador and hooked an ex-First Secretary by mistake.}}\n\nOn 7 May 1959, he asked a prescient starred question on the Planning of Motorways:\n{{quote|...&nbsp;Just as the Roman roads are with us to-day, so these great new roads may be with our successors 1,000 years hence. With this in mind, can my noble friend assure us, first, that the advice of the Advisory Committee [on the Landscape Treatment of Trunk Roads] to which he referred will in all cases in future be sought at a very early stage in the planning of these new roads;  and, secondly, that permanent professional advice will be enlisted from the outset at the planning, the reconnaissance stage, in order to ensure that these great new roads blend as harmoniously as possible with the land-scape through which they pass?}}\n\nOn 20 July 1959 he initiated a debate on ''Western Aid for Uncommitted Countries'', and by January 1961 he was a [[Lord-in-waiting]] to H.M. the Queen, a Government Whip, in [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]]'s administration. He was Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Local Government June 1961 \u2013 July 1962; Minister of State, Home Office July 1962 \u2013 October 1963; [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] October 1963 \u2013 April 1964; [[Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy]] April\u2013October 1964; delegate to the [[Council of Europe]] and the Western European Union (WEU) 1965\u20131967; president of the National Federation of Housing Societies 1965\u20131970; a governor of the [[Centre for Environmental Studies]] 1967\u20131970; chairman of the British Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution at Sea 1968; chairman of the third International Conference on oil pollution of the sea 1968; an hon. vice-president of [[Tory Reform Group|PEST]] (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism); and deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Lords 1967\u20131970. From April 1967 Lords Jellicoe and [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Carrington]] represented the Conservatives in the Lords on the Inter-Party conference group on Lords' reform, which came up with the unsuccessful Parliament (No.2) Bill (1968\u20131969). Leading the debate for the (Conservative) Opposition in November 1968 Jellicoe said:\n{{quote|We hold that a grave constitutional change of this kind should not be brought into effect in the dying years of a discredited Government&nbsp;... a viable Upper House has an essential part to play in our parliamentary structure. We now have a quite considerable constitutional prize in our grasp, the opportunity to build a really viable Upper House on the basis of a broad consensus of support from all Parties&nbsp;... (19 November 1968, Hansard via L. Windmill).}}\n\nDuring the late 1960s he worked in the [[City of London]] where he became chairman of British Reserve Insurance and a director of [[S. G. Warburg & Co.|S G Warburg (Finance and Development) Ltd]].\n\n==Cabinet minister and resignation==\nIn [[Edward Heath|Ted Heath's]] [[Conservative Government 1970-1974|administration]] he was Minister in charge for the Civil Service Department (CSD), [[Lord Privy Seal]] (as such he was eighth on the [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|Roll of The Lords]]) and [[Leader of the House of Lords]] from 20 June 1970 until 24 May 1973.\n\nHaving earlier re-established relations with the miners' union leaders in February 1972, Heath appointed Jellicoe \"energy supremo\" to restore power supplies around the time of the [[Three-Day Week]] and had him set up and chair a Civil Contingencies Unit, which was, when an internal crisis arose, to operate through \"COBRA\" ([[Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms]]).\n\nIn June 1972 Jellicoe was sent to lead [[Concorde]]'s first sales expedition. As Alan Trengove in ''My Lord, the super salesman'', in the Australian ''The Sun'' of 22 June 1972 put it,\n{{quote|There has probably never been a sales team [122 strong] quite like the aristocratic British contingent that is trying to sell the Anglo-French supersonic Concorde to Qantas&nbsp;... The earl is an astute salesman who has obviously done his homework&nbsp;... He has the stamina to address a couple of press conferences each day as well as make daily speeches&nbsp;... cultivate politicians, DCA personnel and Qantas bosses. At fifty-four, the earl looks a rugged character. He has a strong broad chin and speaks with a directness that appeals to Australians&nbsp;... Inevitably, he is beginning to be known in Australia as 'Aeroplane Jellicoe'. If he can land the Concorde deal with Qantas, they may soon be singing in Britain:\n::''I like Aeroplane Jellicoe''\n::''Aeroplane Jellicoe for me.''\n::''I like it for dinner, like it for tea,''\n::''Aeroplane Jellicoe has goodness for me''.}}\n\nTrengove considered [[George Edwards (aviation)|Sir George Edwards]] and Sir Geoffrey Tuttle \"equally impressive members of the sales team\". (Supersonic flights were on the prototype Concorde G-BSST, certificate signed by [[Brian Trubshaw]], and dated 15 June 1972). Jellicoe, with the help of his very experienced Chief Whip, the second [[Earl St Aldwyn|Earl St. Aldwyn]], steered the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|''European Communities Act'' (1972)]] through the Lords, allowing no amendments. The ''Industrial Relations Act'' was another legislative highlight.\n\nIn May 1973 Jellicoe admitted \"some casual affairs\" with [[call girl]]s (from ''Mayfair Escorts'') in the wake of an accidental confusion with [[Antony Lambton|Lord Lambton]]'s prostitution scandal.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alvin |last=Shuster |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/27/archives/a-proper-government-scandal-britain.html |title=A Proper Government Scandal; Britain |date=27 May 1973 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref> The name Jellicoe seems to have emerged as a result of a connection between Lambton, the madame Norma Levy, and a tenement house or community hall in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] in the London district of St. Pancras called ''Jellicoe'' Hall or House, after Basil Jellicoe (1899\u20131935) the housing reformer, and priest. The word Jellicoe was seen in Levy's notebook, and a connection was assumed to the Minister rather than the building; a structure named after the earl's distant cousin, and one that may have been opened by the Admiral himself in June 1928.\n\nThe resignation ended Jellicoe's third career in government service. After the resignation (over his marginal involvement in a minor indiscretion) [[Richard Crossman]], writing in ''The Times'', 30 May 1973 (page 18), described Jellicoe as:\n{{quote|...&nbsp;among the bravest, ablest, most decent members of the Heath Government&nbsp;... [B]ut need the Prime Minister have got rid of Lord Jellicoe in such peremptory style? Could he not have refused his resignation until all the facts were available?}}\n\nOn return from the Whitsun recess, tributes were paid in the Lords to their departed leader: The (Labour Party) Opposition leader and Jellicoe's predecessor as Lord Privy Seal, [[Edward Shackleton, Baron Shackleton|Lord Shackleton]] said:\n{{quote|Lord Jellicoe&nbsp;... has been as good a leader of this House as we have known [cheers].. I don't think we can let him go \u2013 though happily this is not an epitaph \u2013 without expressing our very deep sorrow to the House and to the country [cheers]&nbsp;... with immense thoroughness, patience and personal sensitivity Lord Jellicoe fulfilled his role as Leader of your Lordships House [cheers]&nbsp;... we [Lords Byers and Shackleton] found him an admirable open-minded and wise colleague; my Lords, I believe that we and the country have suffered a grievous loss&nbsp;... (Hansard, 5 June 1973, and ''The Times'', 6 June 1973, for the cheers)}}\n\nLord Byers for the Liberal Party added: \"we regret bitterly his resignation&nbsp;... He was a reforming innovator and the House owes a great deal more than it probably knows to the interest he took in this House and to his initiatives.\" (Hansard, 5 June 1973)\n\nFrom the Cross-Benches [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang|Lord Strang]] added:\n{{quote|To some of us it had been a comfort to have had Lord Jellicoe as Leader. I doubt whether he realises how much we shall miss him. We have been deeply saddened by what has happened. The outstanding record of his achievements will not be dimmed; our warm regard for him will remain. (Hansard, 5 June 1973)}}\n\nWilliam Kendall, general secretary of the [[Civil and Public Services Association]] said:\n{{quote|In our union we respected him as a tough, capable and fair negotiator'' (quoted from ''The Times'', 25 May 1973, page 2); or, as Daniel McGeachie (of ''The Daily Express'') reported on 25 May 1973, ''He was a man in the Macmillan mould&nbsp;... [H]e gave the impression of a solid and straightforward approach to life, to the cut and thrust of debate-but at the same time he was an extraordinarlily subtle person.}}\n\nIn July 1973 the [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Diplock]] Commission, which had been set up to look into the security implications of Lambton and Jellicoe's adventures, concluded its section on Jellicoe (paragraph 24):\n{{quote|...&nbsp;it was Lord Jellicoe's misfortune that his use of 'call girls' happened to come to light at the particular moment that it did, when the attention of the Press was focused on the private conduct of Ministers in connection with the entirely separate case of Lord Lambton.}}\n\n==Business and post-government public career==\nLoss of government office soon seemed somewhat serendipitous. With no estates to distract him Jellicoe was free to re-join [[S. G. Warburg & Co.]] (1 October 1973), and with the help of [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]], who was soon to retire from the board, he became a non-executive director of the sugar company [[Tate & Lyle]] 1973\u20131993. Thanks in the main to Sir Saxon Tate, and presumedly because he had succeeded as chairman (until June 1978) of their subsidiary Tunnel Refineries, the family made him Tate & Lyle's first non-family chairman 1978\u20131983. Having revived and retrenched Tate & Lyle Jellicoe became chairman of Booker Tate, 1988\u201391.\n\nOther non-governmental jobs include: chairman of engineering plant company the Davy Corporation (Davy McKee) (now subsumed into [[Aker Kv\u00e6rner]]) 1985\u20131990; director [[Sotheby's]] Holdings 1973\u20131993; Morgan Crucible 1974\u201388; [[Smiths Group|Smiths Industries Ltd]] 1973\u20131986; S. G. Warburg & Co 1964\u20131970, 1973\u20131988. He was president of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1979\u20131982. He succeeded [[Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick|Lord Limerick]] as chairman of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]'s [[British Overseas Trade Board]] (BOTB) 1983\u20131986, for which he was knighted. That was followed by chairmanship (1986\u20131990) and then the presidency (1990\u20131995) of the East European Trade Council (EETC). He was chairman of the Greek Fund Ltd 1988\u20131994 ([[Schroders]]) and of European Capital Ltd 1991\u20131995.\n\nLord Jellicoe was chairman of the council of [[King's College London]] (KCL) 1974\u20131983; chairman of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) 1982\u20131990; a trustee of the National Aids Trust (alongside the likes of [[Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman|Lord Goodman]], [[David Puttnam]] and [[Robert Maxwell]]);\npresident of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) (and of the Institute of British Geographers (IBG) after amalgamation) 1993\u20131997; president of the [[Anglo-Hellenic League]] 1978\u20131986; president of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] Trust 1987\u20131994; president of the UK [[Crete]] Veterans Association 1991\u20132001; president of the [[British Heart Foundation]] (BHF) 1992\u20131995; [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Southampton University]] 1984\u20131995, and has been closely associated with research and higher education. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1990.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nIn 1995 he helped found [[Hakluyt & Company]], a strategic intelligence and advisory firm, for which he was a director 1996\u20132000. He was president of the SAS Regimental Association 1996\u20132000, when he became its patron. Jellicoe was a member of the Onassis International Prizes Committee (1983\u20131992); a vice-president of The European-Atlantic Group and of the [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron Society]]; he was on the board of the Hellenic College London; patron of the City of Southampton Society; a patron of the Greek Archaeological Committee (UK); one of five patrons of The Community Foundation for Wiltshire and Swindon; a director of The Landscape Foundation (now dormant); patron of Friends of The Royal Hospital School; patron of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology; a member of the World Innovation Fund (WIF) and an associate member of INEED.{{Clarify|name of organization|date=January 2018}} In 2002 he became a patron of ''The Second World War Experience Centre'' in [[Leeds]].\n\n==Later state contributions==\nBack in the Lords and affairs of state; he was chairman of the Select Committee on Committees (1990\u20131993) and President of the [[Parliamentary and Scientific Committee]] (1980\u20131983). In 1983 he was author of the '''Jellicoe Report''' which reviewed the ''Operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976''. ''The Times'' saw this appointment as the end of nine years penance in the political wilderness.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1973 Jellicoe had averaged 90 House of Lords daily attendances per parliamentary session. From 1973 to 1989 his attendance plummeted to a meagre average of nine appearances per session. However, between 1990 and 2001 he turned up a conscientious average of 72 visits per session. He maintained this rate until early 2006, though Jellicoe's last full speech in the Lords was made as part of the ''Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech'' (the Queen's Speech debate) on 28 October 1996, his subject was [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo961028/text/61028-06.htm#61028-06_spnew0|title=Lords Hansard text for 28 Oct 1996 (161028-06) |publisher=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords, Westminster }}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed his hereditary automatic entitlement to attend and sit in the House of Lords, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Jellicoe of Southampton''', of [[Southampton]] in the County of Hampshire, so that he could continue to be summoned<blockquote>1.

He died on 22 February 2007, six weeks shy of his 89th birthday.\n\nAt his death, Lord Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, and arguably the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having succeeded his father on 20 November 1935 and come of age and sat first in parliament on 25 July 1939. Because he waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech, a few peers (viz. [[Robert Shirley, 13th Earl Ferrers|Earl Ferrers]] and [[David Renton, Baron Renton|Lords Renton]], [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Carrington]], [[Denis Healey|Healey]], and [[David Kenworthy, 11th Baron Strabolgi|Strabolgi]]) could have been considered to have been active parliamentarians longer. Moreover, at the time of his death, on the Privy Council only the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] (1951) and Lords [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Carrington]] (1959), [[Bill Deedes|Deedes]] and [[David Renton, Baron Renton|Renton]] (both 1962) had served longer.\n\n==Character==\nIn May 1973, at the time of his resignation from the government, friends are quoted as saying:\n{{quote|If he has a fault it is because he wears his weaknesses on his sleeve. He is too frank. I suppose though, that is no bad thing. He was not flamboyant but he was a hedonist. He is the sort of non-pompous person who does not try to hide his weaknesses. (quoted from Christopher Sweeney's article in ''The Times'', 25 May 1973, page 2)}}\n\nIn July 1970, as one of the first people to be [[Breathalyzer|breathalized]], he was banned from driving for a year and fined 75 pounds with 20 guineas costs for ''having consumed more than the permitted level of alcohol'' in Old Brompton Road at 4 a.m. on 21 March 1970. The trouble was that his new [[Reliant Scimitar]] had a stiff gearbox, or so his story went. Luck saw to it that the case came after the General Election and the ban coincided with the arrival of his right to a full-time government car. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 2000, his friend, the former [[British Ambassador to the United States]], [[Nicholas Henderson|Sir Nicholas Henderson]], wrote:\n{{quote|George is a man of moods.

''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved March 18, 2014.\n</ref> Born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], Mayer attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], but disenrolled and moved to [[Atlanta]] in 1997 with [[Clay Cook]]. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest Festival]], he was signed to [[Aware Records]], and then [[Columbia Records]], which released his first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Inside Wants Out]]''. His following two full-length albums\u2014''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)\u2014did well commercially, achieving [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] status. In 2003, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for the single \"[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]\".\n\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the [[blues]] and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as [[B. B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released a live album in 2005 called ''[[Try!]]'', and his third studio album ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' in 2006. Both albums received critical acclaim, and ''Continuum'' earned Mayer a [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007]] [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. He also won [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Waiting on the World to Change]]\". That album was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' in 2009, a return to pop, with a [[Battle Studies World Tour]].\n\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'', which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]]. However, the discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'', which incorporates [[country music]] influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://music.yahoo.com/photos/top-new-acts-since-2000-1403561474-slideshow/| title=USA: Top 20 New Acts Since 2000| website=Yahoo!

[[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. \n \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed \"Althea\" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with \" [[Truckin']].\" Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:\n\n{{Quote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\n\nI look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time. But I am really eager to get back out with John-boy and chase the music around, get to know each other. When that dream came to me, it was at about that point that I started to realize that I was feeling comfortable with knowing that John had moved, musically speaking \u2013 being able to intuit the songs.

Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest Festival]], he was signed to [[Aware Records]], and then [[Columbia Records]], which released his first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Inside Wants Out]]''. His following two full-length albums\u2014''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)\u2014did well commercially, achieving [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] status. In 2003, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for the single \"[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]\".\n\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the [[blues]] and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as [[B. B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released a live album in 2005 called ''[[Try!]]'', and his third studio album ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' in 2006. Both albums received critical acclaim, and ''Continuum'' earned Mayer a [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007]] [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. He also won [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Waiting on the World to Change]]\". That album was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' in 2009, a return to pop, with a [[Battle Studies World Tour]].\n\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'', which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]]. However, the discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'', which incorporates [[country music]] influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://music.yahoo.com/photos/top-new-acts-since-2000-1403561474-slideshow/| title=USA: Top 20 New Acts Since 2000| website=Yahoo!

[[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. \n \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed \"Althea\" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with \" [[Truckin']].\" Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:\n\n{{Quote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\n\nI look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time.

Silver, gold, color enamel, tempera. Collection V.Logvinenko]]\nAfter Igor\u2019s death at the hands of the Drevlians, Olga assumed the throne because her three-year-old son Svyatoslav was too young to rule. The Drevlians, emboldened by their success in ambushing and killing the king, sent a messenger to Olga proposing that she marry his murderer, [[Mal (prince)|Prince Mal]]. Twenty Drevlian negotiators boated to Kiev to pass along their king\u2019s message and to ensure Olga\u2019s compliance. They arrived in her court and told the queen why they were in Kiev: \u201cto report that they had slain her husband...and that Olga should come and marry their Prince Mal.\u201d<ref name=\":3\">Cross, Samuel Hazzard, Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor, and Nestor. ''The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text.'' Mediaeval Academy of America No. 60. Cambridge, Mass.: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953''.'' 79-80 (line 6453).</ref> Olga responded:<blockquote>Your proposal is pleasing to me\u2019 indeed, my husband cannot rise again from the dead. But I desire to honor you tomorrow in the presence of my people. Return now to your boat, and remain there with an aspect of arrogance. I shall send for you on the morrow, and you shall say, \u2018We will not ride on horses nor go on foot\u2019 carry us in our boat.\u2019 And you shall be carried in your boat.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>When the Drevlians returned the next day, they waited outside Olga's court to receive the honor she had promised. When they repeated the words she had told them to say, the people of Kiev rose up, carrying the Drevlians in their boat. The ambassadors believed this was a great honor, as if they were being carried by [[palanquin]]. The people brought them into the court where they were dropped into the trench Olga had ordered dug the day before and buried alive. It is written that Olga bent down to watch them as they were buried and \u201cinquired whether they found the honor to their taste.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOlga then sent a message to the Drevlians that they should send \u201ctheir distinguished men to her in Kiev, so that she might go to their Prince with due honor.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The Drevlians, unaware of the fate of the first diplomatic party, gathered another party of men to send \u201cthe best men who governed the land of Dereva.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> When they arrived, Olga commanded her people to draw them a bath and invited the men to appear before her after they had bathed. When the Drevlians entered the bathhouse, Olga had it set on fire from the doors, so that all the Drevlians within burned to death.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOlga sent another message to the Drevlians, this time ordering them to \u201cprepare great quantities of mead in the city where you killed my husband, that I may weep over his grave and hold a funeral feast for him.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> When Olga and a small group of attendants arrived at Igor's tomb, she did indeed weep and hold a funeral feast. The Drevlians sat down to join them and began to drink heavily. When the Drevlians were drunk, she ordered her followers to kill them, \u201cand went about herself egging on her retinue to the massacre of the Drevlians.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', five thousand Drevlians were killed on this night, but Olga returned to Kiev to prepare an army to finish off the survivors.\n\nThe initial conflict between the armies of the two nations went very well for the forces of Kievan Rus\u2019, who won the battle handily and drove the survivors back into their cities. Olga then led her army to Iskorosten (what is today [[Korosten]]), the city where her husband had been slain, and laid siege to the city. The siege lasted for a year without success, when Olga thought of a plan to trick the Drevlians. She sent them a message: \u201cWhy do you persist in holding out? All your cities have surrendered to me and submitted to tribute, so that the inhabitants now cultivate their fields and their lands in peace. But you had rather tide of hunger, without submitting to tribute.\u201d<ref name=\":4\">''Primary Chronicle'' 80-1 (line 6454).</ref> The Drevlians responded that they would submit to tribute, but that they were afraid she was still intent on avenging her husband. Olga answered that the murder of the messengers sent to Kiev, as well as the events of the feast night, had been enough for her. She then asked them for a small request: \u201cGive me three pigeons...and three sparrows from each house.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> The Drevlians rejoiced at the prospect of the siege ending for so small a price, and did as she asked.\n\nOlga then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulphur bound with small pieces of cloth to each bird. At nightfall, Olga told her soldiers to set the pieces aflame and release the birds. They returned to their nests within the city, which subsequently set the city ablaze. As the ''Primary Chronicle'' tells it: \u201cThere was not a house that was not consumed, and it was impossible to extinguish the flames, because all the houses caught fire at once.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> As the people fled the burning city, Olga ordered her soldiers to catch them, killing some of them and giving the others as slaves to her followers. She left the remnant to pay tribute.\n\n==== Governance ====\nOlga remained [[regent]] ruler of Kievan Rus with the support of the army and her people. She changed the system of tribute gathering ([[poliudie]]) in the first legal reform recorded in Eastern Europe. She continued to evade proposals of marriage, defended the city during the [[Siege of Kiev (968)|Siege of Kiev]] in 968, and saved the power of the throne for her son.\n\nAfter her dramatic subjugation of the Drevlians, the ''Primary Chronicle'' recounts how Olga \u201cpassed through the land of Dereva, accompanied by her son and her retinue, establishing laws and tribute. Her trading posts and hunting-reserves are there still.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> As queen, Olga established trading-posts and collected tribute along the Msta and the Luga rivers. She established hunting grounds, boundary posts, towns, and trading-posts across the empire. Olga's work helped to centralize state rule with these trade centers, called [[Pogost|''pogosti'']], which served as administrative centers in addition to their mercantile roles. Olga's network of ''pogosti'' would prove important in the ethnic and cultural unification of the Russian nation, and her border posts began the establishment of national boundaries for the kingdom.\n\nDuring her son's prolonged military campaigns, she remained in charge of Kiev, residing in the castle of [[Vyshhorod|Vyshgorod]] with her grandsons.\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe ''Primary Chronicle'' does not go into additional detail about Olga's time as regent, but does tell the story of her conversion to Christianity and subsequent effect on the acceptance of Christianity in Eastern Europe.\n[[File:Lemko_Church_of_Saints_Vladimir_and_Olga.jpg|right|thumb|267x267px|The [[Lemko]] church of Saints Vladimir and Olga, now located at the [[Museum of National Folk Architecture and Rural Life]] in [[Lviv]]]]\n\n==== Conversion ====\nIn the 950s, Olga traveled to [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Byzantine Empire, to visit Emperor Constantine VII.<ref>Thomas J. Craughwell, ''Saints Behaving Badly: The Cutthroats, Crooks, Trollops, Con Men, and Devil-Worshippers Who Became Saints'', 86.</ref> Once in Constantinople, Olga converted to Christianity with the assistance of the Emperor and the [[Patriarch]]. While the ''Primary Chronicle'' does not divulge Olga's motivation for her visit or conversion, it does go into great detail on the conversion process, in which she was baptized and instructed in the ways of Christianity:<blockquote>The reigning Emperor was named Constantine, son of Leo. Olga came before him, and when he saw that she was very fair of countenance and wise as well, the Emperor wondered at her intellect. He conversed with her and remarked that she was worthy to reign with him in his city. When Olga heard his words, she replied that she was still a pagan, and that if he desired to baptize her, he should perform this function himself; otherwise, she was unwilling to accept baptism. The Emperor, with the assistance of the Patriarch, accordingly baptized her. When Olga was enlightened, she rejoiced in soul and body. The Patriarch, who instructed her in the faith, said to her, \u2018Blessed art thou among the women of Rus\u2019, for thou hast loved the light, and quit the darkness. The sons of Rus\u2019 shall bless thee to the last generation of thy descendants.\u2019 He taught her the doctrine of the Church, and instructed her in prayer and fasting, in almsgiving, and in the maintenance of chastity. She bowed her head, and like a sponge absorbing water, she eagerly drank in his teachings. The Princess bowed before the Patriarch, saying, \u2018Through thy prayers, Holy Father, may I be preserved from the crafts and assaults of the devil!\u2019 At her baptism she was christened Helena, after the ancient Empress, mother of Constantine the Great. The Patriarch then blessed her and dismissed her.<ref name=\":5\">''Primary Chronicle'' 82.</ref></blockquote>While the ''Primary Chronicle'' notes that Olga was christened with the name \u201cHelena\u201d after the ancient [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] (the mother of [[Constantine the Great]]), Jonathan Shepard argues that Olga's baptismal name comes from the contemporary emperor's wife, Helena.<ref>Jonathan Shepard, \"The Origins of Rus\u2019 (c.900\u20131015),\" ed. Maureen Perrie (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 58.</ref>\n\nThe observation that Olga was \u201cworthy to reign with him in his city\u201d suggests that the emperor was interested in marrying her. While the ''Chronicle'' explains Constantine's desire to take Olga as his wife as stemming from the fact that she was \u201cfair of countenance and wise as well,\u201d marrying Olga could certainly have helped him gain power over Rus\u2019. The ''Chronicle'' recounts that Olga asked the emperor to baptize her knowing that his baptismal sponsorship, by the rules of spiritual kinship, would make marriage between them a kind of spiritual incest.<ref>Francis Butler, \"Ol'Ga's Conversion and the Construction of Chronicle Narrative,\" ''The Russian Review'' 67, no. 2 (April 2008): 240.</ref> Though her desire to become Christian may have been genuine, this request was also a way for her to maintain political independence.  After the baptism, when Constantine repeated his marriage proposal, Olga answered that she could not marry him since Church law forbade a goddaughter to marry her godfather:<blockquote>After her baptism, the Emperor summoned Olga and made known to her that he wished her to become his wife. But she replied, \u2018How can you marry me, after yourself baptizing me and calling me your daughter? For among Christians that is unlawful, as you yourself must know.\u2019 Then the Emperor said, \u2018Olga, you have outwitted me.\u2019 He gave her many gifts of gold, silver, silks, and various vases, and dismissed her, still calling her his daughter.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>Francis Butler argues that the story of the proposal was a literary embellishment, describing an event that is highly unlikely to have ever actually occurred.<ref>Francis Butler, \"Ol'Ga's Conversion and the Construction of Chronicle Narrative,\" 234.</ref> In fact, at the time of her baptism, Constantine already had an empress. In addition to uncertainty over the truth of the ''Chronicle''\u2019s telling of events in Constantinople, there is controversy over the details of her conversion to Christianity.<ref>Omeljan Pritsak, \"When and Where Was Ol'ga Baptized?\" ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 9, no. 1/2 (June 1985): 5-24.</ref> According to Russian sources, she was baptized in Constantinople in 957. Byzantine sources, however, indicate that she was a Christian prior to her 957 visit. It seems likely that she was baptized in Kiev around 955 and, following a second christening in Constantinople, took the Christian name Helen. Olga was not the first person from Rus\u2019 to convert from her pagan ways-- there were Christians in Igor's court who had taken oaths at the St. Elias Church in Kiev for the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (945)|Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty]] in 945--but she was the most powerful Rus\u2019 individual to undergo baptism during her life.<ref>\"Olga (c. 890\u2013969),\" Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia, 2002, <nowiki>https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/olga-c-890-969</nowiki>.</ref>\n\n==== Efforts to Christianize Kievan Rus' ====\n''The Primary'' ''Chronicle'' reports that Olga received the Patriarch's blessing for her journey home, and that once she arrived, she unsuccessfully attempted to convert her son to Christianity:<blockquote>Now Olga dwelt with her son Svyatoslav, and she urged him to be baptized, but he would not listen to her suggestion, though when any man wished to be baptized, he was not hindered, but only mocked. For to the infidels, the Christian faith is foolishness. They do not comprehend it, because they walk in darkness and do not see the glory of God. Their hearts are hardened, and they can neither hear with their ears nor see with their eyes. For Solomon has said, \u2018The deeds of the unrighteous are far from wisdom. Inasmuch as I have called you, and ye heard me not, I sharpened my words, and ye understood not. But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would have none of my reproach. For they have hated knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah they have not chosen. They would none of my counsel, but despised all my reproof.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>This passage highlights the hostility towards Christianity in Kievan Rus\u2019 in the tenth century. In the ''Chronicle,'' Svyatoslav declares that his followers would \u201claugh\u201d if he were to accept Christianity.<ref name=\":5\" /> While Olga tried to convince her son that his followers would follow his example if he converted, her efforts were in vain. However, her son agreed not to persecute those in his kingdom who did convert, which marked a crucial turning point for Christianity in the area.<ref name=\":7\">Addison Nugent, \"Meet the Murderous Viking Princess Who Brought the Faith to Eastern Europe.\"</ref> Despite the resistance of her people to Christianity, Olga built churches in Kiev, Pskov, and elsewhere.<ref>Craughwell, ''Saints Behaving Badly: The Cutthroats, Crooks, Trollops, Con Men, and Devil-Worshippers Who Became Saints,'' 88.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Holy Roman Emperor ====\nSeven Latin sources document Olga's embassy to Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 959. The continuation of [[Regino of Pr\u00fcm]] mentions that the envoys requested the emperor to appoint a bishop and priests for their nation. The chronicler accuses the envoys of lies, commenting that their trick was not exposed until later. [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] says that the first [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], Saint [[Adalbert (Archbishop of Magdeburg)|Adalbert of Magdeburg]], before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus' (''Rusciae'') as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagan allies of [[Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev|Svyatoslav I]]. The same data is repeated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]].\n\n== Death ==\nAccording to the ''Primary Chronicle'', Olga died from illness in 969, soon after the [[Pechenegs|Pechenegs']] siege of the city.<ref>Ciaran Conliffe, \"Saint Olga, Queen of Kiev,\" HeadStuff, May 10, 2016, , <nowiki>https://www.headstuff.org/culture/history/saint-olga-queen-of-kiev/</nowiki>.</ref> When Svyatoslav announced plans to move his throne to the Danube region, the ailing Olga convinced him to stay with her during her final days. Only three days later, she passed away and her family and all of Kievan Rus\u2019 wept:<blockquote>Svyatoslav announced to his mother and his boyars, \u2018I do not care to remain in Kiev, but should prefer to live in Perya-slavets on the Danube, since that is the centre of my realm, where all riches are concentrated; gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from Greece, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, and from Rus\u2019 furs, wax, honey, and slaves.\u2019 But Olga made reply, \u2018You behold me in my weakness. Why do you desire to depart from me?\u2019 For she was already in precarious health. She thus remonstrated with him and begged him first to bury her and then to go wheresoever he would. Three days later Olga died. Her son wept for her with great mourning, as did likewise her grandsons and all the people. They thus carried her out, and buried her in her tomb. Olga had given command not to hold a funeral feast for her, for she had a priest who performed the last rites over the sainted Princess.<ref name=\":8\">''Primary Chronicle'' 86.</ref></blockquote>Although he disapproved of his mother's Christian tradition, Svyatoslav heeded Olga's request that her priest, Gregory, conduct a Christian funeral without the ritual pagan burial feast.<ref name=\":6\">\"Olga (c. 890\u2013969),\" Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia, 2002, <nowiki>https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/olga-c-890-969</nowiki>.</ref> Her tomb remained in Kiev for over two centuries, but was destroyed by the Mongolian-Tatar armies of Batu Khan in 1240.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Sainthood ===\nAt the time of her death, it seemed that Olga's attempt to make Kievan Rus\u2019 a Christian territory had been a failure. Nonetheless, Olga's Christianizing mission would be brought to fruition by her grandson, [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]], who officially adopted [[Christianity]] in 988.<ref name=\":6\" /> The ''Primary Chronicle'' highlights Olga's holiness in contrast to the pagans around her during her life as well as the significance of her decision to convert to Christianity:<blockquote>Olga was the precursor of the Christian land, even as the day-spring precedes the sun and as the dawn precedes the day. For she shone like the moon by night, and she was radiant among the infidels like a pearl in the mire, since the people were soiled, and not yet purified of their sin by holy baptism. But she herself was cleansed by this sacred purification\u2026. She was the first from Rus\u2019 to enter the kingdom of God, and the son of Rus\u2019 thus praise her as their leader, for since her death she has interceded with God in their behalf.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>In 1547, nearly 600 years after her 969 death, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] named Olga a saint.<ref name=\":7\" /> Because of her proselytizing influence, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]], and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] call Saint Olga by the honorific Isap\u00f3stolos, \"Equal to the Apostles\". She is also a saint in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. Olga's feast day is July 11th, the date of her death.<ref>Michael S.

But the question of Olga as a historical figure and character in the ''Primary Chronicle'' has been taken up in recent years.\n\nOlga's historical characterization as a vengeful princess, juxtaposed with her estimation within the Orthodox tradition as a saint, has produced a variety of modern interpretations of her story. Scholars tend to be more conservative with their interpretations, focusing on what the ''Primary Chronicle'' makes explicit: Olga's role in the spread of Christianity to Eastern Europe and Russia. These texts, generally speaking, focus on Olga's role as advisor to her son, whose decision not to persecute Christians in the Kievan Rus' was a pivotal moment in the religious history of Russia and its neighboring lands. Academic work on Olga tends not to dwell on the narrative twists and turns of her story, instead focusing on extracting historical facts from the story.\n\nModern publications, however, have focused on her as an historical character. Journalists have penned articles with titles ranging from \u201cSaint Olga of Kiev is the Best Warrior Princess You Never Knew\u201d<ref>Natasha Sheldon, \"Saint Olga of Kiev Is the Best Warrior Princess You Never Knew,\" HistoryCollection.co, February 12, 2018, <nowiki>https://historycollection.co/saint-olga-kiev-best-warrior-princess-never-knew/</nowiki>.</ref> to \u201cMeet the Murderous Viking Princess Who Brought the Faith to Eastern Europe.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> These texts, written for a broader audience, tend to focus on Olga's exploits as a sort of historical drama. Her Viking heritage is always brought up, and often used as an explanation for her fiery spirit and military accomplishments. Authors focus on the most dramatic details of her story: her murder of two Drevlian negotiating groups, her wily deception of the Drevlian ruler, and her ultimate conquest of his people. A number of sources make her out to be a proto-feminist figure, a woman who did not allow contemporaneous expectations of gender roles to lock her out of the leadership role. Because there is little evidence to support the idea that Olga's rule was ever questioned by her people, this characterization of her rule is a [[medievalism]] \u2014 that is, an assumption made about history based not on facts but on preconceptions about the past, in this case the rigid relationship between gender and medieval rulership.\n\nThough a number of these contemporary sources refer to Olga as a \u201cwarrior princess,\u201d there is little evidence to suggest she actually participated in the fighting and killing of her enemies. Based on historical precedent, it is more likely that she was a commander of troops, a sort of general or commander-in-chief, than a warrior of particular skill. These assertions have still made their way into the public imagination, however, as evidenced by the appropriation of her image in the Eastern European heavy metal scene.\n\nThis duality of Olga's character \u2014 on the one hand a venerated saint, on the other a bloodthirsty commander of troops \u2014 has made her an attractive figure for subversive artists. Her image has been taken up in the heavy metal scene in some cases, most notably as the muse and cover figure for [[A Perfect Absolution]], a concept album by French band [[Gorod (band)|Gorod]] about Olga of Kiev.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Illuminations from the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Chronicle]]\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438.jpg|Olga's revenge for her husband's death\nFile:Radzivill Olga-Avenge-to-Drevlians.jpg|Fourth revenge of Olga: Burning of Derevlian capital [[Korosten|Iskorosten]]\nFile:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0451\u043c \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0411\u0430\u0433\u0440\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u043c (2).jpg|''Reception of Olga by Constantine VII''\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pskov Airport|Princess Olga Pskov Airport]]\n* [[Order of Princess Olga]] (established in [[Ukraine]] in 1997)\n* [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']]\n*[[A Perfect Absolution]] - concept album by French band [[Gorod (band)|Gorod]] about Olga of Kiev\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |title=Kievan Russia |first=George |last=Vernadsky |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1948 |ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Olga of Kiev}}\n\n* [http://orthodoxwiki.org/Olga_of_Kiev Olga of Kiev - OrthodoxWiki]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef\n| before = [[Igor of Kiev]]\n}}\n{{s-ttl\n| title = [[Rulers of Kievan Rus|Princess of Kiev]]<br> <small>as Regent</small>\n| years = 945\u2013960s\n}}\n{{s-aft\n| after = [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav the Brave]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Catholic saints}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Olga}}\n[[Category:Kievan Rus' princesses]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:Varangians]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian saints]]\n[[Category:Russian saints]]\n[[Category:969 deaths]]\n[[Category:Rurik dynasty]]\n[[Category:10th-century rulers in Europe]]\n[[Category:10th-century women rulers]]\n[[Category:Christian female saints of the Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Christian royal saints]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic royal saints]]\n[[Category:10th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian women in politics]]\n[[Category:10th-century princes in Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:Burials at the Church of the Tithes]]\n\n== Something ==\n\nGoodbye\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name            = [[Saint Olga]]\n|title           = Grand Princess of Kiev, Equal to the Apostles\n|image           = St Olga by Nesterov in 1892.jpg\n|caption         = <small>''Saint Olga'' by [[Mikhail Nesterov]]</small>\n|reign           = 945\u2013960\n|predecessor     = [[Igor of Kiev|Igor I]]\n|successor       = [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav the Brave]]\n|spouse          = [[Igor of Kiev|Igor I]]\n|issue           = [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav the Brave]]\n|dynasty         = [[Rurik Dynasty]] (by marriage)\n|birth_date      = c. 890\u2013925\n|birth_place     = [[Pskov]]\n|death_date      = 969\n|death_place     = [[Kiev]] \n}}\n\n'''Saint Olga''' ({{lang-cu|\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430}}, [[Old Norse]]: ''{{lang|non|Helga}}''; born c. 890\u2013925, in [[Pskov]]{{sfn|Vernadsky|1948|p=39}} \u2013 died 969 AD in [[Kiev]]) was a [[regent]] of [[Kievan Rus']] for her son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] from 945 until 960.

The Drevlians had joined Kievan Rus\u2019 in military campaigns against the [[Byzantine Empire]] and paid [[tribute]] to Igor's predecessors. They stopped paying tribute upon Oleg's death and instead gave money to a local warlord. In 945, Igor set out to the Drevlian capital, Iskorosten (today known as [[Korosten]] in northern Ukraine), to force the tribe to pay tribute to Kievan Rus\u2019.<ref name=\":2\" /> Confronted by Igor's larger army, the Drevlians backed down and paid him.

Silver, gold, color enamel, tempera. Collection V.Logvinenko]]\nAfter Igor\u2019s death at the hands of the Drevlians, Olga assumed the throne because her three-year-old son Svyatoslav was too young to rule. The Drevlians, emboldened by their success in ambushing and killing the king, sent a messenger to Olga proposing that she marry his murderer, [[Mal (prince)|Prince Mal]]. Twenty Drevlian negotiators boated to Kiev to pass along their king\u2019s message and to ensure Olga\u2019s compliance. They arrived in her court and told the queen why they were in Kiev: \u201cto report that they had slain her husband...and that Olga should come and marry their Prince Mal.\u201d<ref name=\":3\">Cross, Samuel Hazzard, Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor, and Nestor. ''The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text.'' Mediaeval Academy of America No. 60. Cambridge, Mass.: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953''.'' 79-80 (line 6453).</ref> Olga responded:<blockquote>Your proposal is pleasing to me\u2019 indeed, my husband cannot rise again from the dead. But I desire to honor you tomorrow in the presence of my people. Return now to your boat, and remain there with an aspect of arrogance. I shall send for you on the morrow, and you shall say, \u2018We will not ride on horses nor go on foot\u2019 carry us in our boat.\u2019 And you shall be carried in your boat.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>When the Drevlians returned the next day, they waited outside Olga's court to receive the honor she had promised. When they repeated the words she had told them to say, the people of Kiev rose up, carrying the Drevlians in their boat. The ambassadors believed this was a great honor, as if they were being carried by [[palanquin]]. The people brought them into the court where they were dropped into the trench Olga had ordered dug the day before and buried alive. It is written that Olga bent down to watch them as they were buried and \u201cinquired whether they found the honor to their taste.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOlga then sent a message to the Drevlians that they should send \u201ctheir distinguished men to her in Kiev, so that she might go to their Prince with due honor.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The Drevlians, unaware of the fate of the first diplomatic party, gathered another party of men to send \u201cthe best men who governed the land of Dereva.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> When they arrived, Olga commanded her people to draw them a bath and invited the men to appear before her after they had bathed. When the Drevlians entered the bathhouse, Olga had it set on fire from the doors, so that all the Drevlians within burned to death.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOlga sent another message to the Drevlians, this time ordering them to \u201cprepare great quantities of mead in the city where you killed my husband, that I may weep over his grave and hold a funeral feast for him.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> When Olga and a small group of attendants arrived at Igor's tomb, she did indeed weep and hold a funeral feast. The Drevlians sat down to join them and began to drink heavily. When the Drevlians were drunk, she ordered her followers to kill them, \u201cand went about herself egging on her retinue to the massacre of the Drevlians.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> According to the ''Primary Chronicle'', five thousand Drevlians were killed on this night, but Olga returned to Kiev to prepare an army to finish off the survivors.\n\nThe initial conflict between the armies of the two nations went very well for the forces of Kievan Rus\u2019, who won the battle handily and drove the survivors back into their cities. Olga then led her army to Iskorosten (what is today [[Korosten]]), the city where her husband had been slain, and laid siege to the city. The siege lasted for a year without success, when Olga thought of a plan to trick the Drevlians. She sent them a message: \u201cWhy do you persist in holding out? All your cities have surrendered to me and submitted to tribute, so that the inhabitants now cultivate their fields and their lands in peace. But you had rather tide of hunger, without submitting to tribute.\u201d<ref name=\":4\">''Primary Chronicle'' 80-1 (line 6454).</ref> The Drevlians responded that they would submit to tribute, but that they were afraid she was still intent on avenging her husband. Olga answered that the murder of the messengers sent to Kiev, as well as the events of the feast night, had been enough for her. She then asked them for a small request: \u201cGive me three pigeons...and three sparrows from each house.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> The Drevlians rejoiced at the prospect of the siege ending for so small a price, and did as she asked.\n\nOlga then instructed her army to attach a piece of sulphur bound with small pieces of cloth to each bird. At nightfall, Olga told her soldiers to set the pieces aflame and release the birds. They returned to their nests within the city, which subsequently set the city ablaze. As the ''Primary Chronicle'' tells it: \u201cThere was not a house that was not consumed, and it was impossible to extinguish the flames, because all the houses caught fire at once.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> As the people fled the burning city, Olga ordered her soldiers to catch them, killing some of them and giving the others as slaves to her followers. She left the remnant to pay tribute.\n\n==== Governance ====\nOlga remained [[regent]] ruler of Kievan Rus with the support of the army and her people. She changed the system of tribute gathering ([[poliudie]]) in the first legal reform recorded in Eastern Europe. She continued to evade proposals of marriage, defended the city during the [[Siege of Kiev (968)|Siege of Kiev]] in 968, and saved the power of the throne for her son.\n\nAfter her dramatic subjugation of the Drevlians, the ''Primary Chronicle'' recounts how Olga \u201cpassed through the land of Dereva, accompanied by her son and her retinue, establishing laws and tribute. Her trading posts and hunting-reserves are there still.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> As queen, Olga established trading-posts and collected tribute along the Msta and the Luga rivers. She established hunting grounds, boundary posts, towns, and trading-posts across the empire. Olga's work helped to centralize state rule with these trade centers, called [[Pogost|''pogosti'']], which served as administrative centers in addition to their mercantile roles. Olga's network of ''pogosti'' would prove important in the ethnic and cultural unification of the Russian nation, and her border posts began the establishment of national boundaries for the kingdom.\n\nDuring her son's prolonged military campaigns, she remained in charge of Kiev, residing in the castle of [[Vyshhorod|Vyshgorod]] with her grandsons.\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe ''Primary Chronicle'' does not go into additional detail about Olga's time as regent, but does tell the story of her conversion to Christianity and subsequent effect on the acceptance of Christianity in Eastern Europe.\n[[File:Lemko_Church_of_Saints_Vladimir_and_Olga.jpg|right|thumb|267x267px|The [[Lemko]] church of Saints Vladimir and Olga, now located at the [[Museum of National Folk Architecture and Rural Life]] in [[Lviv]]]]\n\n==== Conversion ====\nIn the 950s, Olga traveled to [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Byzantine Empire, to visit Emperor Constantine VII.<ref>Thomas J. Craughwell, ''Saints Behaving Badly: The Cutthroats, Crooks, Trollops, Con Men, and Devil-Worshippers Who Became Saints'', 86.</ref> Once in Constantinople, Olga converted to Christianity with the assistance of the Emperor and the [[Patriarch]]. While the ''Primary Chronicle'' does not divulge Olga's motivation for her visit or conversion, it does go into great detail on the conversion process, in which she was baptized and instructed in the ways of Christianity:<blockquote>The reigning Emperor was named Constantine, son of Leo. Olga came before him, and when he saw that she was very fair of countenance and wise as well, the Emperor wondered at her intellect. He conversed with her and remarked that she was worthy to reign with him in his city. When Olga heard his words, she replied that she was still a pagan, and that if he desired to baptize her, he should perform this function himself; otherwise, she was unwilling to accept baptism. The Emperor, with the assistance of the Patriarch, accordingly baptized her. When Olga was enlightened, she rejoiced in soul and body. The Patriarch, who instructed her in the faith, said to her, \u2018Blessed art thou among the women of Rus\u2019, for thou hast loved the light, and quit the darkness. The sons of Rus\u2019 shall bless thee to the last generation of thy descendants.\u2019 He taught her the doctrine of the Church, and instructed her in prayer and fasting, in almsgiving, and in the maintenance of chastity. She bowed her head, and like a sponge absorbing water, she eagerly drank in his teachings. The Princess bowed before the Patriarch, saying, \u2018Through thy prayers, Holy Father, may I be preserved from the crafts and assaults of the devil!\u2019 At her baptism she was christened Helena, after the ancient Empress, mother of Constantine the Great. The Patriarch then blessed her and dismissed her.<ref name=\":5\">''Primary Chronicle'' 82.</ref></blockquote>While the ''Primary Chronicle'' notes that Olga was christened with the name \u201cHelena\u201d after the ancient [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]] (the mother of [[Constantine the Great]]), Jonathan Shepard argues that Olga's baptismal name comes from the contemporary emperor's wife, Helena.<ref>Jonathan Shepard, \"The Origins of Rus\u2019 (c.900\u20131015),\" ed. Maureen Perrie (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 58.</ref>\n\nThe observation that Olga was \u201cworthy to reign with him in his city\u201d suggests that the emperor was interested in marrying her. While the ''Chronicle'' explains Constantine's desire to take Olga as his wife as stemming from the fact that she was \u201cfair of countenance and wise as well,\u201d marrying Olga could certainly have helped him gain power over Rus\u2019. The ''Chronicle'' recounts that Olga asked the emperor to baptize her knowing that his baptismal sponsorship, by the rules of spiritual kinship, would make marriage between them a kind of spiritual incest.<ref>Francis Butler, \"Ol'Ga's Conversion and the Construction of Chronicle Narrative,\" ''The Russian Review'' 67, no. 2 (April 2008): 240.</ref> Though her desire to become Christian may have been genuine, this request was also a way for her to maintain political independence.  After the baptism, when Constantine repeated his marriage proposal, Olga answered that she could not marry him since Church law forbade a goddaughter to marry her godfather:<blockquote>After her baptism, the Emperor summoned Olga and made known to her that he wished her to become his wife. But she replied, \u2018How can you marry me, after yourself baptizing me and calling me your daughter? For among Christians that is unlawful, as you yourself must know.\u2019 Then the Emperor said, \u2018Olga, you have outwitted me.\u2019 He gave her many gifts of gold, silver, silks, and various vases, and dismissed her, still calling her his daughter.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>Francis Butler argues that the story of the proposal was a literary embellishment, describing an event that is highly unlikely to have ever actually occurred.<ref>Francis Butler, \"Ol'Ga's Conversion and the Construction of Chronicle Narrative,\" 234.</ref> In fact, at the time of her baptism, Constantine already had an empress. In addition to uncertainty over the truth of the ''Chronicle''\u2019s telling of events in Constantinople, there is controversy over the details of her conversion to Christianity.<ref>Omeljan Pritsak, \"When and Where Was Ol'ga Baptized?\" ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 9, no. 1/2 (June 1985): 5-24.</ref> According to Russian sources, she was baptized in Constantinople in 957. Byzantine sources, however, indicate that she was a Christian prior to her 957 visit. It seems likely that she was baptized in Kiev around 955 and, following a second christening in Constantinople, took the Christian name Helen. Olga was not the first person from Rus\u2019 to convert from her pagan ways-- there were Christians in Igor's court who had taken oaths at the St. Elias Church in Kiev for the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (945)|Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty]] in 945--but she was the most powerful Rus\u2019 individual to undergo baptism during her life.<ref>\"Olga (c. 890\u2013969),\" Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia, 2002, <nowiki>https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/olga-c-890-969</nowiki>.</ref>\n\n==== Efforts to Christianize Kievan Rus' ====\n''The Primary'' ''Chronicle'' reports that Olga received the Patriarch's blessing for her journey home, and that once she arrived, she unsuccessfully attempted to convert her son to Christianity:<blockquote>Now Olga dwelt with her son Svyatoslav, and she urged him to be baptized, but he would not listen to her suggestion, though when any man wished to be baptized, he was not hindered, but only mocked. For to the infidels, the Christian faith is foolishness. They do not comprehend it, because they walk in darkness and do not see the glory of God. Their hearts are hardened, and they can neither hear with their ears nor see with their eyes. For Solomon has said, \u2018The deeds of the unrighteous are far from wisdom. Inasmuch as I have called you, and ye heard me not, I sharpened my words, and ye understood not. But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would have none of my reproach. For they have hated knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah they have not chosen. They would none of my counsel, but despised all my reproof.<ref name=\":5\" /></blockquote>This passage highlights the hostility towards Christianity in Kievan Rus\u2019 in the tenth century. In the ''Chronicle,'' Svyatoslav declares that his followers would \u201claugh\u201d if he were to accept Christianity.<ref name=\":5\" /> While Olga tried to convince her son that his followers would follow his example if he converted, her efforts were in vain. However, her son agreed not to persecute those in his kingdom who did convert, which marked a crucial turning point for Christianity in the area.<ref name=\":7\">Addison Nugent, \"Meet the Murderous Viking Princess Who Brought the Faith to Eastern Europe.\"</ref> Despite the resistance of her people to Christianity, Olga built churches in Kiev, Pskov, and elsewhere.<ref>Craughwell, ''Saints Behaving Badly: The Cutthroats, Crooks, Trollops, Con Men, and Devil-Worshippers Who Became Saints,'' 88.</ref>\n\n==== Relations with the Holy Roman Emperor ====\nSeven Latin sources document Olga's embassy to Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 959. The continuation of [[Regino of Pr\u00fcm]] mentions that the envoys requested the emperor to appoint a bishop and priests for their nation. The chronicler accuses the envoys of lies, commenting that their trick was not exposed until later. [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] says that the first [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], Saint [[Adalbert (Archbishop of Magdeburg)|Adalbert of Magdeburg]], before being promoted to this high rank, was sent by Emperor Otto to the country of the Rus' (''Rusciae'') as a simple bishop but was expelled by pagan allies of [[Sviatoslav I, Prince of Kiev|Svyatoslav I]]. The same data is repeated in the annals of [[Quedlinburg]] and [[Hildesheim]].\n\n== Death ==\nAccording to the ''Primary Chronicle'', Olga died from illness in 969, soon after the [[Pechenegs|Pechenegs']] siege of the city.<ref>Ciaran Conliffe, \"Saint Olga, Queen of Kiev,\" HeadStuff, May 10, 2016, , <nowiki>https://www.headstuff.org/culture/history/saint-olga-queen-of-kiev/</nowiki>.</ref> When Svyatoslav announced plans to move his throne to the Danube region, the ailing Olga convinced him to stay with her during her final days. Only three days later, she passed away and her family and all of Kievan Rus\u2019 wept:<blockquote>Svyatoslav announced to his mother and his boyars, \u2018I do not care to remain in Kiev, but should prefer to live in Perya-slavets on the Danube, since that is the centre of my realm, where all riches are concentrated; gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from Greece, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, and from Rus\u2019 furs, wax, honey, and slaves.\u2019 But Olga made reply, \u2018You behold me in my weakness. Why do you desire to depart from me?\u2019 For she was already in precarious health. She thus remonstrated with him and begged him first to bury her and then to go wheresoever he would. Three days later Olga died. Her son wept for her with great mourning, as did likewise her grandsons and all the people. They thus carried her out, and buried her in her tomb.

For she shone like the moon by night, and she was radiant among the infidels like a pearl in the mire, since the people were soiled, and not yet purified of their sin by holy baptism. But she herself was cleansed by this sacred purification\u2026.

But the question of Olga as a historical figure and character in the ''Primary Chronicle'' has been taken up in recent years.\n\nOlga's historical characterization as a vengeful princess, juxtaposed with her estimation within the Orthodox tradition as a saint, has produced a variety of modern interpretations of her story. Scholars tend to be more conservative with their interpretations, focusing on what the ''Primary Chronicle'' makes explicit: Olga's role in the spread of Christianity to Eastern Europe and Russia. These texts, generally speaking, focus on Olga's role as advisor to her son, whose decision not to persecute Christians in the Kievan Rus' was a pivotal moment in the religious history of Russia and its neighboring lands. Academic work on Olga tends not to dwell on the narrative twists and turns of her story, instead focusing on extracting historical facts from the story.\n\nModern publications, however, have focused on her as an historical character. Journalists have penned articles with titles ranging from \u201cSaint Olga of Kiev is the Best Warrior Princess You Never Knew\u201d<ref>Natasha Sheldon, \"Saint Olga of Kiev Is the Best Warrior Princess You Never Knew,\" HistoryCollection.co, February 12, 2018, <nowiki>https://historycollection.co/saint-olga-kiev-best-warrior-princess-never-knew/</nowiki>.</ref> to \u201cMeet the Murderous Viking Princess Who Brought the Faith to Eastern Europe.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> These texts, written for a broader audience, tend to focus on Olga's exploits as a sort of historical drama. Her Viking heritage is always brought up, and often used as an explanation for her fiery spirit and military accomplishments. Authors focus on the most dramatic details of her story: her murder of two Drevlian negotiating groups, her wily deception of the Drevlian ruler, and her ultimate conquest of his people. A number of sources make her out to be a proto-feminist figure, a woman who did not allow contemporaneous expectations of gender roles to lock her out of the leadership role. Because there is little evidence to support the idea that Olga's rule was ever questioned by her people, this characterization of her rule is a [[medievalism]] \u2014 that is, an assumption made about history based not on facts but on preconceptions about the past, in this case the rigid relationship between gender and medieval rulership.\n\nThough a number of these contemporary sources refer to Olga as a \u201cwarrior princess,\u201d there is little evidence to suggest she actually participated in the fighting and killing of her enemies. Based on historical precedent, it is more likely that she was a commander of troops, a sort of general or commander-in-chief, than a warrior of particular skill. These assertions have still made their way into the public imagination, however, as evidenced by the appropriation of her image in the Eastern European heavy metal scene.\n\nThis duality of Olga's character \u2014 on the one hand a venerated saint, on the other a bloodthirsty commander of troops \u2014 has made her an attractive figure for subversive artists. Her image has been taken up in the heavy metal scene in some cases, most notably as the muse and cover figure for [[A Perfect Absolution]], a concept album by French band [[Gorod (band)|Gorod]] about Olga of Kiev.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Illuminations from the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Chronicle]]\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438.jpg|Olga's revenge for her husband's death\nFile:Radzivill Olga-Avenge-to-Drevlians.jpg|Fourth revenge of Olga: Burning of Derevlian capital [[Korosten|Iskorosten]]\nFile:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0451\u043c \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0411\u0430\u0433\u0440\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u043c (2).jpg|''Reception of Olga by Constantine VII''\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pskov Airport|Princess Olga Pskov Airport]]\n* [[Order of Princess Olga]] (established in [[Ukraine]] in 1997)\n* [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']]\n*[[A Perfect Absolution]] - concept album by French band [[Gorod (band)|Gorod]] about Olga of Kiev\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |title=Kievan Russia |first=George |last=Vernadsky |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1948 |ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Olga of Kiev}}\n\n* [http://orthodoxwiki.org/Olga_of_Kiev Olga of Kiev - OrthodoxWiki]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef\n| before = [[Igor of Kiev]]\n}}\n{{s-ttl\n| title = [[Rulers of Kievan Rus|Princess of Kiev]]<br> <small>as Regent</small>\n| years = 945\u2013960s\n}}\n{{s-aft\n| after = [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav the Brave]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Catholic saints}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Olga}}\n[[Category:Kievan Rus' princesses]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:Varangians]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian saints]]\n[[Category:Russian saints]]\n[[Category:969 deaths]]\n[[Category:Rurik dynasty]]\n[[Category:10th-century rulers in Europe]]\n[[Category:10th-century women rulers]]\n[[Category:Christian female saints of the Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Christian royal saints]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic royal saints]]\n[[Category:10th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian women in politics]]\n[[Category:10th-century princes in Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:Burials at the Church of the Tithes]]\n", "name_user": "139.255.173.96", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Test Edit comment)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_of_Kiev"}

They ran the gym for almost two years together as co-owners, and when they realized that this operation wasn't plausible for them, they were going to close it and reopen the location as an antiques shop. They offered it to a frequently visiting gym member, [[Ken Sprague]], who purchased it in late 1971, and Gold's was saved as a gym. Sprague was the first owner of Gold's to actually sponsor and hold bodybuilding competitions, and his promotional skills and film industry contacts helped build the establishment's profile.\n\n=== ''Pumping Iron'' ===\nBy 1975, when [[George Butler (filmmaker)|George Butler]] was going to film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', it was Sprague's savvy, telling Butler that he would paint the windows over to minimize back light, and let Butler mount a lighting grid to the inside ceiling that made Gold's Gym the primary location for filming ''Pumping Iron''. After the release of the movie in 1977, and along with the 1977 [[Mr. America (contest)|Mr. America]] contest and Mr. America Day parade held in Santa Monica, sponsored and conceived of by Sprague, the profile of Gold's gym grew even larger. That year's Mr. America had more press requests than the 1977 [[Academy Awards]].

They ran the gym for almost two years together as co-owners, and when they realized that this operation wasn't plausible for them, they were going to close it and reopen the location as an antiques shop. They offered it to a frequently visiting gym member, [[Ken Sprague]], who purchased it in late 1971, and Gold's was saved as a gym. Sprague was the first owner of Gold's to actually sponsor and hold bodybuilding competitions, and his promotional skills and film industry contacts helped build the establishment's profile.\n\n=== ''Pumping Iron'' ===\nBy 1975, when [[George Butler (filmmaker)|George Butler]] was going to film ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', it was Sprague's savvy, telling Butler that he would paint the windows over to minimize back light, and let Butler mount a lighting grid to the inside ceiling that made Gold's Gym the primary location for filming ''Pumping Iron''. After the release of the movie in 1977, and along with the 1977 [[Mr. America (contest)|Mr. America]] contest and Mr. America Day parade held in Santa Monica, sponsored and conceived of by Sprague, the profile of Gold's gym grew even larger. That year's Mr. America had more press requests than the 1977 [[Academy Awards]]. By 1979, when Sprague had sold Gold's Gym, it was the most famous gym in the world.<ref>Interviews with Bill Grant, Ken Waller, Dave Du Pre, Pete Samra, Tony Pearson, Ken Sprague, Wayne Gallasch; October/November 2015; by Marc Martinez for an upcoming documentary, for which [https://vimeo.com/channels/1154824 trailers are available]</ref>\n\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Gold's Gym was owned by Peter Grymkowski (a Mr. World body building champion) and his partners.

When Donovan seeks the advice of the parish priest on how to raise an adolescent boy, the priest, Father Dan (Frank Sheridan), enlists the services of his niece, Kitty Costello (Marion Shilling). When she directs Donovan to get honest work, he agrees, and she gets him a job at the ironworks where she is also employed.  He is slowly transformed by the effect that both Midge and Kitty have on him.

The University has a total enrollment (undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies) of roughly 18,560 students. Rowan offers 74 bachelor's, 51 master's degrees, four doctoral degrees, two professional degrees, seven undergraduate certificates, and 38 post-baccalaureate certificates.\n\n== History ==\nIn the early part of the 20th century, there was a shortage of adequately trained teachers in the state of New Jersey. It was decided to build a two-year [[Normal school]] in the southern part of the state to counter the trend. Among the candidate towns, Glassboro became the location due in no small part to its easy access to passenger rail as well as its offer to donate {{convert|25|acre|m2|abbr=off}} of land to the state to build the Normal school. The 1917 purchase price of the property was raised by the residents of the town ($7,000 at the time) and used to purchase a tract that belonged to the Whitney family, who owned the local [[glassworks]] during the 19th century.<ref name=\"SouthJersey.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southjersey.com/article/19891/Glassboro-A-History|title=Glassboro: a History|author=SouthJersey.com|accessdate=25 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526012355/http://www.southjersey.com/article/19891/Glassboro-A-History|archive-date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923 the Glassboro Normal School opened, with a class of 236 female students arriving at the train station in front of Bunce Hall. With the evolution of teacher training the school became a four-year program in 1934; in 1937 the school was renamed The New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro and became [[co-educational]] shortly thereafter.\n\nThe college was one of the first in the country to begin programs for teachers for [[reading disabilities]] and [[physical therapy]] in 1935 and 1944, respectively. Glassboro State began to develop a reputation as a leader in [[special education]]. After several years and the return of soldiers from World War II, the college was able to expand its enrollment from a wartime low of 170 in 1943 to an expansion of several additional campus buildings and academic programs over the next 15 years and became Glassboro State College in 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rowan.edu/about/oppaf/history.html|title=Rowan History|website=rowan.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Hollybush Summit ===\nThe [[Cold War]] [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] between U.S. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] took place from June 23\u201325, 1967, in Hollybush Mansion on the campus of then-Glassboro State College.

The event lead to Glassboro State College's ranking as the #28 [[party school|Party School]] in the nation in the January 1987 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/college/admin/playboy.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Playboy's Party Schools|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> Coincidentally, in the Greek section of that same issue of Playboy, the Epsilon Eta chapter of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] was also named one of the [[Animal House]] Contenders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.totse.com/en/ego/literary_genius/party40.html |title=Playboy's Top 40 party schools |work=Totse Official site |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230160227/http://www.totse.com/en/ego/literary_genius/party40.html |archivedate=30 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough the alcohol-fueled Spring Weekend was canceled by then-President Herman James (a non-alcoholic version continued for several years), Glassboro State College remained known for its hard-partying culture. However, in 1988, there began one of the biggest crackdowns in school history. As a result of the drinking death of freshman James Callahan at [[Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick, Herman James decided to make GSC an example for the rest of the state colleges and universities to follow. He invited the [[New Jersey Alcoholic Beverage Control]] Commission (ABC) to the school. He began shutting down off-campus parties and placing undercover agents in the local liquor establishments. This prompted [[Morton Downey Jr.]], who was based in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], and very popular at the time, to do an untelevised show focusing on the drinking age and the classic argument that an eighteen-year-old can go off to war and die for their country. However, they cannot legally buy and consume beer. The following year, the ABC did not return, and the partying atmosphere that Glassboro State College was known for, returned in earnest and continued into the 1990s and early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== University status ===\n\nIn 1992, president Dr. Herman James oversaw the development of Glassboro State College into what would eventually become Rowan University. This transformation came about because of what was then the largest single gift to a public college or University in history. Industrialist [[Henry Rowan|Henry M. Rowan, Jr.]], a graduate of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] class of 1947, and his wife donated $100 million to the college, which later changed its name to Rowan College of New Jersey in his honor. The gift stipulated that the college open a College of Engineering and it allowed the college to expand its course and curriculum offerings to the point that it became a full-fledged university, achieving that status in 1997. This status was given by the State of New Jersey based on Rowan University's doctoral degree program, the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership, and the numerous Masters level programs in Education and Business.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nFollowing Dr. James' retirement as president in 1998, Dr. Donald Farish was chosen to succeed him and began further expansion on the Glassboro campus, opening a modern Science Hall in 2003 and a building to house the College of Education in 2005. In addition, acquisitions during the beginning of Farish's tenure as president led to the development of a tract of land bordering [[US Route 322]] and [[New Jersey Route 55|State Route 55]] as the West Campus.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Presidency of [[Donald J. Farish]] was noted for a continued crackdown on the University's partying culture which declined alongside a rise in [[SAT]] scores and class rank among the incoming freshman classes. The crackdown on the partying culture began in earnest in 2002 with the official banning of [[kegs]] for use by Greek letter organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhitonline.com/2002/02/UniversitybanskegsfromGreeklife/ |title=University bans kegs from Greek life |date=28 February 2002 |work=The Whit Online |author=Duerr, Johanna }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2006, two Rowan University students were found guilty for serving alcohol to minors, at an off campus party that resulted in the death of a 16-year-old male with Rowan promising to follow up with its own penalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhitonline.com/2006/12/Studentssentencedinunderagedrinkingdeath/ |title=Students sentenced in underage drinking death |work=The Whit |author=Dunphy, Thomas |year=2006 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==== West Campus ====\nOn March 20, 2006, President Farish announced a joint venture between the University and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) to construct a new athletic complex based around a 20,000 seat [[soccer-specific stadium]] on property owned by the campus at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 322]] and [[New Jersey Route 55|Route 55]]. The stadium was planned to be complete for the start of the 2009 MLS season.

Rowan offers 74 bachelor's, 51 master's degrees, four doctoral degrees, two professional degrees, seven undergraduate certificates, and 38 post-baccalaureate certificates.\n\n== History ==\nIn the early part of the 20th century, there was a shortage of adequately trained teachers in the state of New Jersey. It was decided to build a two-year [[Normal school]] in the southern part of the state to counter the trend. Among the candidate towns, Glassboro became the location due in no small part to its easy access to passenger rail as well as its offer to donate {{convert|25|acre|m2|abbr=off}} of land to the state to build the Normal school. The 1917 purchase price of the property was raised by the residents of the town ($7,000 at the time) and used to purchase a tract that belonged to the Whitney family, who owned the local [[glassworks]] during the 19th century.<ref name=\"SouthJersey.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southjersey.com/article/19891/Glassboro-A-History|title=Glassboro: a History|author=SouthJersey.com|accessdate=25 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526012355/http://www.southjersey.com/article/19891/Glassboro-A-History|archive-date=26 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923 the Glassboro Normal School opened, with a class of 236 female students arriving at the train station in front of Bunce Hall. With the evolution of teacher training the school became a four-year program in 1934; in 1937 the school was renamed The New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro and became [[co-educational]] shortly thereafter.\n\nThe college was one of the first in the country to begin programs for teachers for [[reading disabilities]] and [[physical therapy]] in 1935 and 1944, respectively. Glassboro State began to develop a reputation as a leader in [[special education]]. After several years and the return of soldiers from World War II, the college was able to expand its enrollment from a wartime low of 170 in 1943 to an expansion of several additional campus buildings and academic programs over the next 15 years and became Glassboro State College in 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rowan.edu/about/oppaf/history.html|title=Rowan History|website=rowan.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Hollybush Summit ===\nThe [[Cold War]] [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] between U.S. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] took place from June 23\u201325, 1967, in Hollybush Mansion on the campus of then-Glassboro State College.

However, in 1988, there began one of the biggest crackdowns in school history. As a result of the drinking death of freshman James Callahan at [[Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick, Herman James decided to make GSC an example for the rest of the state colleges and universities to follow. He invited the [[New Jersey Alcoholic Beverage Control]] Commission (ABC) to the school. He began shutting down off-campus parties and placing undercover agents in the local liquor establishments. This prompted [[Morton Downey Jr.]], who was based in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], and very popular at the time, to do an untelevised show focusing on the drinking age and the classic argument that an eighteen-year-old can go off to war and die for their country. However, they cannot legally buy and consume beer. The following year, the ABC did not return, and the partying atmosphere that Glassboro State College was known for, returned in earnest and continued into the 1990s and early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== University status ===\n\nIn 1992, president Dr. Herman James oversaw the development of Glassboro State College into what would eventually become Rowan University. This transformation came about because of what was then the largest single gift to a public college or University in history. Industrialist [[Henry Rowan|Henry M. Rowan, Jr.]], a graduate of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] class of 1947, and his wife donated $100 million to the college, which later changed its name to Rowan College of New Jersey in his honor. The gift stipulated that the college open a College of Engineering and it allowed the college to expand its course and curriculum offerings to the point that it became a full-fledged university, achieving that status in 1997. This status was given by the State of New Jersey based on Rowan University's doctoral degree program, the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership, and the numerous Masters level programs in Education and Business.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nFollowing Dr. James' retirement as president in 1998, Dr. Donald Farish was chosen to succeed him and began further expansion on the Glassboro campus, opening a modern Science Hall in 2003 and a building to house the College of Education in 2005. In addition, acquisitions during the beginning of Farish's tenure as president led to the development of a tract of land bordering [[US Route 322]] and [[New Jersey Route 55|State Route 55]] as the West Campus.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Presidency of [[Donald J. Farish]] was noted for a continued crackdown on the University's partying culture which declined alongside a rise in [[SAT]] scores and class rank among the incoming freshman classes. The crackdown on the partying culture began in earnest in 2002 with the official banning of [[kegs]] for use by Greek letter organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhitonline.com/2002/02/UniversitybanskegsfromGreeklife/ |title=University bans kegs from Greek life |date=28 February 2002 |work=The Whit Online |author=Duerr, Johanna }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2006, two Rowan University students were found guilty for serving alcohol to minors, at an off campus party that resulted in the death of a 16-year-old male with Rowan promising to follow up with its own penalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhitonline.com/2006/12/Studentssentencedinunderagedrinkingdeath/ |title=Students sentenced in underage drinking death |work=The Whit |author=Dunphy, Thomas |year=2006 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==== West Campus ====\nOn March 20, 2006, President Farish announced a joint venture between the University and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) to construct a new athletic complex based around a 20,000 seat [[soccer-specific stadium]] on property owned by the campus at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 322]] and [[New Jersey Route 55|Route 55]].

He was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the [[nickname]] \"The Cat\". He was one of several goalkeepers ([[Gordon West]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick.\n\nBonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to [[Gordon Banks]]; he was part of the winning England squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but did not play. He belatedly received a winners' medal in 2009, after [[the Football Association]] led a successful campaign for non-playing members of the squad to be recognised. After Banks fell ill before the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, Bonetti played as England lost 3\u20132 to [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn 1948 Bonetti's family moved from [[London]] to [[Worthing]] on the [[Sussex]] coast. His parents ran a cafe on the seafront next to the [[Dome Cinema|Worthing Dome]]. They were Swiss emigrants to England.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/12/peter-bonetti-obituary |title=Peter Bonetti obituary |first=Brian |last=Glanville |date=12 April 2020 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Bonetti shone at an early age, playing for [[Worthing F.C.|Worthing]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nChelsea signed him from the [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] youth team after his mother had written to then-manager [[Ted Drake]], requesting that he give her son a trial. Whilst a Chelsea junior, Bonetti made five appearances for [[Croydon F.C.|Croydon Amateurs]] in the [[Surrey Senior League]] thanks to youth team coach Albert Tennant who was also coaching Croydon at that time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Celebrating 60 years of Croydon FC |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Celebrating-60-years-Croydon-FC/story-19762019-detail/story.html |accessdate=4 March 2015 |work=[[Croydon Advertiser]] |date=9 September 2013}}</ref> He made his first team debut in 1960, and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth side win the [[FA Youth Cup]]. From the [[1960-61 in English football|1960\u201361]] season onward he was Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper, a position he held more-or-less constantly for the next nineteen years. Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti's second full season, which saw the appointment of [[Tommy Docherty]] as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young side which included [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Terry Venables]], [[John Hollins]] and [[Barry Bridges]].<ref name=bbccat>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52263959|title='Peter Bonetti - Chelsea's 'cat' with brilliant athleticism and flamboyance'|work=BBC Sport|date=12 April 2020|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] to have a chance of going up. Chelsea won 1\u20130, with Bonetti making a brilliant last minute save to deny [[George Mulhall]] and maintain his side's promotion chances; a 7\u20130 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] secured instant promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/03/30/my-blue-days--john-boyle|title=My Blue Days: John Boyle &#124; Official Site &#124; Chelsea Football Club|website=ChelseaFC}}</ref>\n[[File:1965\u201366 Fairs Cup - AC Milan v Chelsea FC - Rivera scores.jpg|thumb|left|Bonetti (no. 1) with Chelsea, while vainly trying to oppose the shot of A.C. Milan's [[Gianni Rivera|Rivera]] during the away defeat at [[San Siro]] valid for the [[1965\u201366 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], third round]]\n\nThe new Chelsea side challenged for honours during the 1960s, with Bonetti a key figure throughout, although more often than not the team narrowly missed out. The club won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[Football League Cup Final 1965|1965]] with a 3\u20132 [[aggregate score|aggregate]] victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Leicester put Chelsea under heavy pressure in the second leg at [[Filbert Street]], but an inspired performance from Bonetti helped secure a 0\u20130 draw, and thus the trophy for his side.<ref name=bbccat/> For most of that season Chelsea were on course to add both the league title and the [[FA Cup]], but ultimately missed out. They were beaten by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup;<ref name=bbccat/> meanwhile, their title challenge ended with a few games left, following a bust-up between Docherty and several of his first-team players (though not Bonetti). The disunity behind the scenes meant that a much-weakened team was fielded in a key match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in which Bonetti conceded six goals.\n\nBonetti played in every game of Chelsea's [[Fairs Cup]] run the following season, putting in a series of impressive displays against the likes of [[AS Roma]], [[AC Milan]] and [[FC Barcelona]], though the side was eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of [[Alex Stepney]] at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper, and he considered putting in a [[Transfer (football)|transfer]] request, but Stepney ultimately played only one game for the club and was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but the team got outplayed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2\u20131.\n\nThat was the closest he came to winning another trophy with Chelsea until 1970, by which time Docherty had been succeeded by [[Dave Sexton]]. In 1970, Chelsea again reached the [[FA Cup Final 1970|FA Cup final]] and this time faced reigning league champions [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Over the two fiercely contested games, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly into the replay at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]], his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]]. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both [[Peter Lorimer]] and [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]], and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in [[extra time]] to help secure a 2\u20131 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] awards.\n\nA year later, the team added the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] after another replayed win in the final, this time over Spanish giants [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea took a 2\u20130 lead in the replay, but Real dominated for much of the second half and it was another inspired performance from Bonetti that helped them hold on for a 2\u20131 win. <ref name=\"Constable2014\">{{cite book |author=Nick Constable |title=Match of the Day: 50 Years of Football |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nZS9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81 |date=15 September 2014 |publisher=Ebury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4481-4253-8 |pages=81\u2013 }}</ref>\n\nThat was his last trophy with the club, although they narrowly missed out on more in the following years, losing in the 1972 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and in the semi-finals of the same competition to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a year later.<ref name=bbccat/> Financial and disciplinary problems within the club prevented them from building on their success.\n\n===St Louis Stars===\nBonetti left on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] in 1975, joining the [[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|St. Louis Stars]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL). That year, he played 21 games for the side and helped them top the Central Division that summer and reach the play-off semi-finals.\n\n===Return to Chelsea===\nHe then returned to Chelsea, where his experience proved invaluable in helping new manager [[Eddie McCreadie]]'s young side gain promotion in [[1976-77 in English football|1976\u201377]]. Two years later, in May 1979, he played his final game for Chelsea, a 1\u20131 draw with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], having made a total of 729 appearances for the club in nineteen years \u2013 only [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]] has made more \u2013 and kept over 200 [[clean sheet]]s.

He was thrust into the starting line-up as a late replacement for Banks, who was suffering from severe [[food poisoning]]. During the match England relinquished a 2\u20130 second-half lead and lost 3\u20132 after extra time. Bonetti received a large amount of blame from the public for the loss, and never played for England again.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burnton |first1=Simon |title=World Cup stunning moments: Gordon Banks is stricken |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/09/world-cup-stunning-moments-gordon-banks-england-1970 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup final]] only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4\u20132 win over West Germany received medals.

He was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the [[nickname]] \"The Cat\". He was one of several goalkeepers ([[Gordon West]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick.\n\nBonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to [[Gordon Banks]]; he was part of the winning England squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but did not play. He belatedly received a winners' medal in 2009, after [[the Football Association]] led a successful campaign for non-playing members of the squad to be recognised. After Banks fell ill before the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, Bonetti played as England lost 3\u20132 to [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn 1948 Bonetti's family moved from [[London]] to [[Worthing]] on the [[Sussex]] coast. His parents ran a cafe on the seafront next to the [[Dome Cinema|Worthing Dome]]. They were Swiss emigrants to England.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/12/peter-bonetti-obituary |title=Peter Bonetti obituary |first=Brian |last=Glanville |date=12 April 2020 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Bonetti shone at an early age, playing for [[Worthing F.C.|Worthing]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nChelsea signed him from the [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] youth team after his mother had written to then-manager [[Ted Drake]], requesting that he give her son a trial. Whilst a Chelsea junior, Bonetti made five appearances for [[Croydon F.C.|Croydon Amateurs]] in the [[Surrey Senior League]] thanks to youth team coach Albert Tennant who was also coaching Croydon at that time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Celebrating 60 years of Croydon FC |url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Celebrating-60-years-Croydon-FC/story-19762019-detail/story.html |accessdate=4 March 2015 |work=[[Croydon Advertiser]] |date=9 September 2013}}</ref> He made his first team debut in 1960, and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth side win the [[FA Youth Cup]]. From the [[1960-61 in English football|1960\u201361]] season onward he was Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper, a position he held more-or-less constantly for the next nineteen years. Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti's second full season, which saw the appointment of [[Tommy Docherty]] as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young side which included [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Terry Venables]], [[John Hollins]] and [[Barry Bridges]].<ref name=bbccat>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52263959|title='Peter Bonetti - Chelsea's 'cat' with brilliant athleticism and flamboyance'|work=BBC Sport|date=12 April 2020|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>  The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] to have a chance of going up. Chelsea won 1\u20130, with Bonetti making a brilliant last minute save to deny [[George Mulhall]] and maintain his side's promotion chances; a 7\u20130 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] secured instant promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/03/30/my-blue-days--john-boyle|title=My Blue Days: John Boyle &#124; Official Site &#124; Chelsea Football Club|website=ChelseaFC}}</ref>\n[[File:1965\u201366 Fairs Cup - AC Milan v Chelsea FC - Rivera scores.jpg|thumb|left|Bonetti (no. 1) with Chelsea, while vainly trying to oppose the shot of A.C. Milan's [[Gianni Rivera|Rivera]] during the away defeat at [[San Siro]] valid for the [[1965\u201366 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], third round]]\n\nThe new Chelsea side challenged for honours during the 1960s, with Bonetti a key figure throughout, although more often than not the team narrowly missed out. The club won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[Football League Cup Final 1965|1965]] with a 3\u20132 [[aggregate score|aggregate]] victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Leicester put Chelsea under heavy pressure in the second leg at [[Filbert Street]], but an inspired performance from Bonetti helped secure a 0\u20130 draw, and thus the trophy for his side.<ref name=bbccat/> For most of that season Chelsea were on course to add both the league title and the [[FA Cup]], but ultimately missed out. They were beaten by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup;<ref name=bbccat/> meanwhile, their title challenge ended with a few games left, following a bust-up between Docherty and several of his first-team players (though not Bonetti). The disunity behind the scenes meant that a much-weakened team was fielded in a key match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in which Bonetti conceded six goals.\n\nBonetti played in every game of Chelsea's [[Fairs Cup]] run the following season, putting in a series of impressive displays against the likes of [[AS Roma]], [[AC Milan]] and [[FC Barcelona]], though the side was eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of [[Alex Stepney]] at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper, and he considered putting in a [[Transfer (football)|transfer]] request, but Stepney ultimately played only one game for the club and was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but the team got outplayed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2\u20131.\n\nThat was the closest he came to winning another trophy with Chelsea until 1970, by which time Docherty had been succeeded by [[Dave Sexton]]. In 1970, Chelsea again reached the [[FA Cup Final 1970|FA Cup final]] and this time faced reigning league champions [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Over the two fiercely contested games, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly into the replay at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]], his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]]. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both [[Peter Lorimer]] and [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]], and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in [[extra time]] to help secure a 2\u20131 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] awards.\n\nA year later, the team added the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] after another replayed win in the final, this time over Spanish giants [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea took a 2\u20130 lead in the replay, but Real dominated for much of the second half and it was another inspired performance from Bonetti that helped them hold on for a 2\u20131 win. <ref name=\"Constable2014\">{{cite book |author=Nick Constable |title=Match of the Day: 50 Years of Football |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nZS9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81 |date=15 September 2014 |publisher=Ebury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4481-4253-8 |pages=81\u2013 }}</ref>\n\nThat was his last trophy with the club, although they narrowly missed out on more in the following years, losing in the 1972 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and in the semi-finals of the same competition to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a year later.<ref name=bbccat/> Financial and disciplinary problems within the club prevented them from building on their success.\n\n===St Louis Stars===\nBonetti left on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] in 1975, joining the [[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|St. Louis Stars]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL). That year, he played 21 games for the side and helped them top the Central Division that summer and reach the play-off semi-finals.\n\n===Return to Chelsea===\nHe then returned to Chelsea, where his experience proved invaluable in helping new manager [[Eddie McCreadie]]'s young side gain promotion in [[1976-77 in English football|1976\u201377]]. Two years later, in May 1979, he played his final game for Chelsea, a 1\u20131 draw with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], having made a total of 729 appearances for the club in nineteen years \u2013 only [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]] has made more \u2013 and kept over 200 [[clean sheet]]s. He conceded one goal or less in two-thirds of his games for Chelsea.\n\n===England===\n[[File:Anefo 922-9422 Peter Bonetti, Bobby Moore, Amsterdam 05.11.1969.jpg|thumb|Bonetti saves at a match against the Netherlands on 5 November 1969]]\nBonetti earned seven [[Cap (football)|caps]] for England, kept out of the team by [[Gordon Banks]]. He was a member of England's successful [[FIFA World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]] [[1966 FIFA World Cup squads#England|squad]], but did not make an appearance.<ref name=bbc/>\n\nBonetti's England career is largely remembered for one match \u2013 the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in Mexico. He was thrust into the starting line-up as a late replacement for Banks, who was suffering from severe [[food poisoning]]. During the match England relinquished a 2\u20130 second-half lead and lost 3\u20132 after extra time. Bonetti received a large amount of blame from the public for the loss, and never played for England again.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Burnton |first1=Simon |title=World Cup stunning moments: Gordon Banks is stricken |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/09/world-cup-stunning-moments-gordon-banks-england-1970 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup final]] only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4\u20132 win over West Germany received medals. Following a [[The Football Association|Football Association]]-led campaign to persuade [[FIFA]] to award medals to all winning [[1966 FIFA World Cup squads#England|squad members]], Bonetti was presented with his medal by prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] at a ceremony at [[10 Downing Street]] on 10 June 2009.<ref name=bbc>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8093891.stm|title=World Cup 1966 winners honoured|date=10 June 2009|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nAfter leaving Chelsea, Bonetti moved to the [[Isle of Mull]] where he ran a guesthouse and became a [[Mail carrier|postman]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/sport/peter-bonetti-the-chelsea-great-who-became-an-england-scapegoat/|title=Peter Bonetti: The Chelsea great who became an England scapegoat|first=Press|last=Association|date=12 April 2020}}</ref> While living in Scotland, he briefly came out of retirement to play several games for [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] as understudy to [[Hamish McAlpine]].

The song was modified and adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944. TR2282.jpg|thumb|right|180px|An Italian partisan in [[Florence]], 1944]]\n\"Bella Ciao\" was originally sung as \"''Alla mattina appena alzata''\" by [[Seasonal industry|seasonal]] workers of paddy fields of [[rice]], especially in Italy's [[Po Valley]] from the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th century with different lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G7m_91aU1TYC&pg=PA43&dq=bella+ciao#v=onepage&q=bella+ciao&f=false|title=Songs That Made History Around the World|first=JERRY|last=SILVERMAN|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781610650168}}</ref> They worked at [[wikt: mondare|monda]] ([[weeding]]) the rice fields in northern Italy, to help the healthy growth of young rice plants. It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

The song was modified and adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.\n\n==History==\n[[File:An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944.

It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. \n\nMonda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

His court was in [[Ioannina]], and the territory he governed incorporated most of [[Epirus]] and the western parts of [[Thessaly]] and [[Greek Macedonia]].

He joined the administrative-military apparatus of the Ottoman Empire, holding various posts until 1788 when he was appointed pasha, ruler of the [[sanjak of Ioannina]]. His diplomatic and administrative skills, his interest in modernist ideas and concepts, his popular piety, his religious neutrality, his suppression of banditry, his vengefulness and harshness in imposing law and order, and his looting practices towards persons and communities in order to increase his proceeds caused both the admiration and the criticism of his contemporaries, as well as an ongoing controversy among historians regarding his personality. Finally falling afoul of the Ottoman central government, Ali Pasha was declared a rebel in 1820 and was killed in 1822 at the age of 81 or 82.

In 1820, Ali Pasha, after long tensions with the [[Ottoman military reform efforts|Turkish Reforms]], allegedly ordered the assassination of [[Gaskho Bey]], a political opponent in [[Constantinople]]; Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who sought to restore the authority of the [[Sublime Porte]], took this as a major opportunity to move against Ali Pasha by ordering his immediate deposition.\n\n[[File:Ali Pascha von Janina - Sultan Mahmud II - Johann Nepomuk Geiger.jpg|thumb|Ali Pasha's head being presented to the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]]]]\n[[File:Ali Pashas Grave (Medium).JPG|thumb|Ali Pasha's tomb in Ioannina]]\nAli Pasha refused to resign his official post and put up a fierce resistance to the Sultan's troop movements as some 20,000 Turkish troops led by [[Hursid Pasha]] were fighting Ali Pasha's small but formidable army. Most of his followers abandoned him without fighting and fled, including [[Odysseas Androutsos|Androutsos]] and his sons Veli and Muhtar, or else joined the Ottoman army. Among these were [[Omer Vrioni]] and [[Alexis Noutsos]], who went unopposed to Ioannina, which was besieged in September 1820.\n\nOn December 4, 1820, Ali Pasha and the [[Souliotes]] formed an anti-Ottoman coalition, to which the Souliotes contributed 3,000 soldiers.

Koliopoulos '' Brigands with a Cause'', p. 40</ref> However he feared that the [[Klephts]] might rout him before the arrival of the Ottoman Turks.\n\nHis separatist actions constitute a great example of the institutional corruption and dividing trends prevailing in the Ottoman Empire at the time. His effort to become an independent ruler finally caused the reaction of the Sublime Porte, which sent the army against him. After about two years of fighting, in January 1822, Ottoman forces had taken most of the fortifications of Ioannina except the fortified palace inside the kastro. Ali Pasha opened negotiations. Deceived with offers of a full pardon, he was persuaded to leave the fortress and settle in the Monastery of St Panteleimon on the island in [[Lake Pamvotis]], previously taken by the Ottoman army during the siege. When asked to surrender for beheading, he famously proclaimed:\n\n\"''My head ... will not be surrendered like the head of a slave,\"''<ref name=\"Dumas\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2753/2753.txt ''Ali Pacha: Celebrated Crimes''] by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re</ref> and kept fighting till the end.

Thus, Ali Pasha of Tepelena died in 1822.\n\n<blockquote>[[Hursid Pasha]], to whom it was presented on a large dish of silver plate, rose to receive it, bowed three times before it, and respectfully kissed the beard, expressing aloud his wish that he himself might deserve a similar end.

He joined the administrative-military apparatus of the Ottoman Empire, holding various posts until 1788 when he was appointed pasha, ruler of the [[sanjak of Ioannina]]. His diplomatic and administrative skills, his interest in modernist ideas and concepts, his popular piety, his religious neutrality, his suppression of banditry, his vengefulness and harshness in imposing law and order, and his looting practices towards persons and communities in order to increase his proceeds caused both the admiration and the criticism of his contemporaries, as well as an ongoing controversy among historians regarding his personality. Finally falling afoul of the Ottoman central government, Ali Pasha was declared a rebel in 1820 and was killed in 1822 at the age of 81 or 82. In [[Western literature]], Ali Pasha became the personification of an \"oriental despot\".{{sfn|Clayer|2014}}\n\n==Name==\nHis name in the local languages were: <!--alphabetical order -->{{lang-sq|Ali Pash\u00eb Tepelenjoti}}; {{lang-rup|Ali P\u00e3shelu}}; {{lang-el|\u0391\u03bb\u03ae \u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2 \u03a4\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2}} {{transl|el|''Ali Pasas Tepelenlis''}} or {{lang|el|\u0391\u03bb\u03ae \u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd}} {{transl|el|''Ali Pasas ton Ioanninon''}} (Ali Pasha of [[Ioannina]]); and {{lang-tr|Tepedelenli Ali Pa\u015fa}} ({{lang-ota|\u062a\u067e\u0647\u0640\u062f\u0644\u0646\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a \u067e\u0627\u0634\u0627|rtl=yes}}).\n\n==Background and early years==\n[[File:Ali Pashas in Tepelena.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Ali Pasha in Tepelene]]\nAt some point in the 19th century, Ali's family was attributed with a legendary ancestry; according to this claim, Ali's family supposedly descended from a [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] [[dervish]] named Nazif who migrated from [[Konya]] to Tepelene through [[K\u00fctahya]].{{sfn|Clayer|2014}}<ref name=\"Norris1993\">\n{{cite book\n |author  = H.

Deceived with offers of a full pardon, he was persuaded to leave the fortress and settle in the Monastery of St Panteleimon on the island in [[Lake Pamvotis]], previously taken by the Ottoman army during the siege.
