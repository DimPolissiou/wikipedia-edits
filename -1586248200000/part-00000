Arith, 1, 274, 487</ref>\n\n==Proof==\n\nThe proof uses the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a [[finite field|field]]. See the article [[Characteristic (algebra)#Case of fields|prime field]] for more details.\n\nBecause the modulus is prime, [[Lagrange's theorem (number theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] applies: a polynomial of degree {{mvar|k}} can only have at most {{mvar|k}} roots. In particular, {{math|''x''{{sup|2}} &equiv; ''a'' (mod ''p'')}} has at most 2 solutions for each {{mvar|a}}. This immediately implies that besides 0, there are at least {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} distinct quadratic residues modulo {{mvar|p}}: each of the {{math|''p'' &minus; 1}} possible values of {{mvar|x}} can only be accompanied by one other to give the same residue.\n\nIn fact, <math> (p-x)^{2}\\equiv x^{2} \\pmod p.</math>This is because <math> (p-x)^{2} \\equiv p^{2}-{2}{x}{p}+x^{2} \\equiv x^{2} \\pmod p.</math>\nSo, the <math> \\tfrac{p-1}{2}</math> distinct quadratic residues are:\n<math>1^{2}, 2^{2}, ... , (\\tfrac{p-1}{2})^{2} \\pmod p. </math>\n \nAs {{mvar|a}} is coprime to {{mvar|p}}, [[Fermat's little theorem]] says that\n:<math>\na^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod p,\n</math>\nwhich can be written as\n:<math>\n\\left( a^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}}-1 \\right)\\left( a^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}}+1 \\right)    \\equiv 0 \\pmod p.\n</math>\nSince the integers mod {{mvar|p}} form a field, for each {{mvar|a}}, one or the other of these factors must be zero.\n\nNow if {{mvar|a}} is a quadratic residue, {{math|''a'' \u2261 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}},\n:<math>\na^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}}\\equiv {(x^2)}^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv x^{p-1}\\equiv1\\pmod p.\n</math>\nSo every quadratic residue (mod {{mvar|p}}) makes the first factor zero.\n\nApplying Lagrange's theorem again, we note that there can be no more than {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} values of {{mvar|a}} that make the first factor zero. But as we noted at the beginning, there are at least {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} distinct quadratic residues (mod {{mvar|p}}) (besides 0). Therefore, they are precisely the residue classes that make the first factor zero. The other {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} residue classes, the nonresidues, must make the second factor zero, or they would not satisfy Fermat's little theorem. This is Euler's criterion.\n\n===Alternative proof===\n\nThis proof only uses the fact that any congruence <math>kx\\equiv l\\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math> has a unique (modulo <math>p</math>) solution <math>x</math> provided <math>p</math> does not divide <math>k</math>. (This is true because as <math>x</math> runs through all nonzero remainders modulo <math>p</math> without repetitions, so does <math>kx</math> - if we have <math>kx_1\\equiv kx_2 \\pmod p</math>, then <math>p|k(x_1-x_2)</math>, hence <math>p|(x_1-x_2)</math>, but <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> aren't congruent modulo <math>p</math>.) It follows from this fact that all nonzero remainders modulo <math>p</math> the square of which isn't congruent to <math>a</math> can be grouped into pairs <math>(x,y)</math> according to the rule that the product of the members of each pair is congruent to <math>a</math> modulo <math>p</math> (since by this fact for every <math>y</math> we can find such an <math>x</math>, uniquely, and vice versa, and they will differ from each other if <math>y^2</math> is not congruent to <math>a</math>). If <math>a</math> is a quadratic nonresidue, this is simply a regrouping of all <math>p-1</math> nonzero residues into <math>(p-1)/2</math> pairs, hence we conclude that <math>1\\cdot2\\cdot ... \\cdot (p-1)\\equiv a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>. If <math>a</math> is a quadratic residue, exactly two remainders were not among those paired, <math>r</math> and <math>-r</math> such that <math>r^2\\equiv a\\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>. If we pair those two absent remainders together, their product will be <math>-a</math> rather than <math>a</math>, whence in this case <math>1\\cdot2\\cdot ... \\cdot (p-1)\\equiv -a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>. In summary, considering these two cases we have demonstrated that for <math>a\\not\\equiv 0 \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math> we have <math>1\\cdot2\\cdot ... \\cdot (p-1)\\equiv -\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>, It remains to substitute <math>a=1</math> (which is obviously a square) into this formula to obtain at once [[Wilson's theorem]], Euler's criterion, and (by squaring both sides of Euler's criterion) [[Fermat's little theorem]].\n\n==Examples==\n'''Example 1: Finding primes for which ''a'' is a residue'''\n\nLet ''a'' = 17. For which primes ''p'' is 17 a quadratic residue?\n\nWe can test prime ''p'''s manually given the formula above.\n\nIn one case, testing ''p'' = 3, we have 17<sup>(3 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 17<sup>1</sup> \u2261 2 \u2261 \u22121 (mod 3), therefore 17 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3.\n\nIn another case, testing ''p'' = 13, we have 17<sup>(13 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 17<sup>6</sup> \u2261 1 (mod 13), therefore 17 is a quadratic residue modulo 13.  As confirmation, note that 17 \u2261 4 (mod 13), and 2<sup>2</sup> = 4.\n\nWe can do these calculations faster by using various modular arithmetic and Legendre symbol properties.\n\nIf we keep calculating the values, we find:\n:(17/''p'') = +1 for ''p'' = {13, 19, ...} (17 is a quadratic residue modulo these values)\n\n:(17/''p'') = \u22121 for ''p'' = {3, 5, 7, 11, 23, ...} (17 is not a quadratic residue modulo these values).\n\n'''Example 2: Finding residues given a prime modulus ''p'' '''\n\nWhich numbers are squares modulo 17 (quadratic residues modulo 17)?\n\nWe can manually calculate it as:\n: 1<sup>2</sup> = 1\n: 2<sup>2</sup> = 4\n: 3<sup>2</sup> = 9\n: 4<sup>2</sup> = 16\n: 5<sup>2</sup> = 25 \u2261 8 (mod 17)\n: 6<sup>2</sup> = 36 \u2261 2 (mod 17)\n: 7<sup>2</sup> = 49 \u2261 15 (mod 17)\n: 8<sup>2</sup> = 64 \u2261 13 (mod 17).\n\nSo the set of the quadratic residues modulo 17 is {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16}.  Note that we did not need to calculate squares for the values 9 through 16, as they are all negatives of the previously squared values (e.g. 9 \u2261 \u22128 (mod 17), so 9<sup>2</sup> \u2261 (\u22128)<sup>2</sup> = 64 \u2261 13 (mod 17)).\n\nWe can find quadratic residues or verify them using the above formula.  To test if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 2<sup>(17 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 2<sup>8</sup> \u2261 1 (mod 17), so it is a quadratic residue.  To test if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 3<sup>(17 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 3<sup>8</sup> \u2261 16 \u2261 \u22121 (mod 17), so it is not a quadratic residue.\n\nEuler's criterion is related to the [[Quadratic reciprocity|Law of quadratic reciprocity]].\n\n==Applications==\n\nIn practice, it is more efficient to use an extended variant of [[Euclid's algorithm]] to calculate the [[Jacobi symbol#Calculating the Jacobi symbol|Jacobi symbol]] <math>\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)</math>. If <math>n</math> is an odd prime, this is equal to the Legendre symbol, and decides whether <math>a</math> is a quadratic residue modulo <math>n</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, since the equivalence of <math>a^\\frac{n-1}{2}</math> to the Jacobi symbol holds for all odd primes, but not necessarily for composite numbers, calculating both and comparing them can be used as a primality test, specifically the [[Solovay-Strassen primality test]]. Composite numbers for which the congruence holds for a given <math>a</math> are called [[Euler\u2013Jacobi pseudoprime]]s to base <math>a</math>.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\nThe ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' has been translated from Gauss's [[Classical Latin|Ciceronian Latin]] into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].

Arith, 1, 274, 487</ref>\n\n==Proof==\n\nThe proof uses the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a [[finite field|field]]. See the article [[Characteristic_(algebra)#Case_of_fields|prime field]] for more details.\n\nBecause the modulus is prime, [[Lagrange's theorem (number theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] applies: a polynomial of degree {{mvar|k}} can only have at most {{mvar|k}} roots. In particular, {{math|''x''{{sup|2}} &equiv; ''a'' (mod ''p'')}} has at most 2 solutions for each {{mvar|a}}. This immediately implies that besides 0, there are at least {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} distinct quadratic residues modulo {{mvar|p}}: each of the {{math|''p'' &minus; 1}} possible values of {{mvar|x}} can only be accompanied by one other to give the same residue.\n\nIn fact, <math> (p-x)^{2}\\equiv x^{2} \\pmod p.</math>This is because <math> (p-x)^{2} \\equiv p^{2}-{2}{x}{p}+x^{2} \\equiv x^{2} \\pmod p.</math>\nSo, the <math> \\tfrac{p-1}{2}</math> distinct quadratic residues are:\n<math>1^{2}, 2^{2}, ... , (\\tfrac{p-1}{2})^{2} \\pmod p. </math>\n \nAs {{mvar|a}} is coprime to {{mvar|p}}, [[Fermat's little theorem]] says that\n:<math>\na^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod p,\n</math>\nwhich can be written as\n:<math>\n\\left( a^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}}-1 \\right)\\left( a^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}}+1 \\right)    \\equiv 0 \\pmod p.\n</math>\nSince the integers mod {{mvar|p}} form a field, for each {{mvar|a}}, one or the other of these factors must be zero.\n\nNow if {{mvar|a}} is a quadratic residue, {{math|''a'' \u2261 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}},\n:<math>\na^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}}\\equiv {(x^2)}^{\\tfrac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv x^{p-1}\\equiv1\\pmod p.\n</math>\nSo every quadratic residue (mod {{mvar|p}}) makes the first factor zero.\n\nApplying Lagrange's theorem again, we note that there can be no more than {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} values of {{mvar|a}} that make the first factor zero. But as we noted at the beginning, there are at least {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} distinct quadratic residues (mod {{mvar|p}}) (besides 0). Therefore they are precisely the residue classes that make the first factor zero. The other {{math|{{sfrac|''p'' &minus; 1|2}}}} residue classes, the nonresidues, must make the second factor zero, or they would not satisfy Fermat's little theorem. This is Euler's criterion.\n\n===Alternative proof===\n\nThis proof only uses the fact that any congruence <math>kx\\equiv l\\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math> has a unique (modulo <math>p</math>) solution <math>x</math> provided <math>p</math> does not divide <math>k</math>. (This is true because as <math>x</math> runs through all nonzero remainders modulo <math>p</math> without repetitions, so does <math>kx</math> - if we have <math>kx_1\\equiv kx_2 \\pmod p</math>, then <math>p|k(x_1-x_2)</math>, hence <math>p|(x_1-x_2)</math>, but <math>x_1</math> and <math>x_2</math> aren't congruent modulo <math>p</math>.) It follows from this fact that all nonzero remainders modulo <math>p</math> the square of which isn't congruent to <math>a</math> can be grouped into pairs <math>(x,y)</math> according to the rule that the product of the members of each pair is congruent to <math>a</math> modulo <math>p</math> (since by this fact for every <math>y</math> we can find such an <math>x</math>, uniquely, and vice versa, and they will differ from each other if <math>y^2</math> is not congruent to <math>a</math>). If <math>a</math> is a quadratic nonresidue, this is simply a regrouping of all <math>p-1</math> nonzero residues into <math>(p-1)/2</math> pairs, hence we conclude that <math>1\\cdot2\\cdot ... \\cdot (p-1)\\equiv a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>. If <math>a</math> is a quadratic residue, exactly two remainders were not among those paired, <math>r</math> and <math>-r</math> such that <math>r^2\\equiv a\\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>. If we pair those two absent remainders together, their product will be <math>-a</math> rather than <math>a</math>, whence in this case <math>1\\cdot2\\cdot ... \\cdot (p-1)\\equiv -a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>. In summary, considering these two cases we have demonstrated that for <math>a\\not\\equiv 0 \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math> we have <math>1\\cdot2\\cdot ... \\cdot (p-1)\\equiv -\\left(\\frac{a}{p}\\right)a^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\!\\!\\! \\pmod p</math>, It remains to substitute <math>a=1</math> (which is obviously a square) into this formula to obtain at once [[Wilson's theorem]], Euler's criterion, and (by squaring both sides of Euler's criterion) [[Fermat's little theorem]].\n\n==Examples==\n'''Example 1: Finding primes for which ''a'' is a residue'''\n\nLet ''a'' = 17. For which primes ''p'' is 17 a quadratic residue?\n\nWe can test prime ''p'''s manually given the formula above.\n\nIn one case, testing ''p'' = 3, we have 17<sup>(3 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 17<sup>1</sup> \u2261 2 \u2261 \u22121 (mod 3), therefore 17 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3.\n\nIn another case, testing ''p'' = 13, we have 17<sup>(13 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 17<sup>6</sup> \u2261 1 (mod 13), therefore 17 is a quadratic residue modulo 13.  As confirmation, note that 17 \u2261 4 (mod 13), and 2<sup>2</sup> = 4.\n\nWe can do these calculations faster by using various modular arithmetic and Legendre symbol properties.\n\nIf we keep calculating the values, we find:\n:(17/''p'') = +1 for ''p'' = {13, 19, ...} (17 is a quadratic residue modulo these values)\n\n:(17/''p'') = \u22121 for ''p'' = {3, 5, 7, 11, 23, ...} (17 is not a quadratic residue modulo these values).\n\n'''Example 2: Finding residues given a prime modulus ''p'' '''\n\nWhich numbers are squares modulo 17 (quadratic residues modulo 17)?\n\nWe can manually calculate it as:\n: 1<sup>2</sup> = 1\n: 2<sup>2</sup> = 4\n: 3<sup>2</sup> = 9\n: 4<sup>2</sup> = 16\n: 5<sup>2</sup> = 25 \u2261 8 (mod 17)\n: 6<sup>2</sup> = 36 \u2261 2 (mod 17)\n: 7<sup>2</sup> = 49 \u2261 15 (mod 17)\n: 8<sup>2</sup> = 64 \u2261 13 (mod 17).\n\nSo the set of the quadratic residues modulo 17 is {1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16}.  Note that we did not need to calculate squares for the values 9 through 16, as they are all negatives of the previously squared values (e.g. 9 \u2261 \u22128 (mod 17), so 9<sup>2</sup> \u2261 (\u22128)<sup>2</sup> = 64 \u2261 13 (mod 17)).\n\nWe can find quadratic residues or verify them using the above formula.  To test if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 2<sup>(17 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 2<sup>8</sup> \u2261 1 (mod 17), so it is a quadratic residue.  To test if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 17, we calculate 3<sup>(17 \u2212 1)/2</sup> = 3<sup>8</sup> \u2261 16 \u2261 \u22121 (mod 17), so it is not a quadratic residue.\n\nEuler's criterion is related to the [[Quadratic reciprocity|Law of quadratic reciprocity]].\n\n==Applications==\n\nIn practice, it is more efficient to use an extended variant of [[Euclid's algorithm]] to calculate the [[Jacobi_symbol#Calculating_the_Jacobi_symbol|Jacobi symbol]] <math>\\left(\\frac{a}{n}\\right)</math>. If <math>n</math> is an odd prime, this is equal to the Legendre symbol, and decides whether <math>a</math> is a quadratic residue modulo <math>n</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, since the equivalence of <math>a^\\frac{n-1}{2}</math> to the Jacobi symbol holds for all odd primes, but not necessarily for composite numbers, calculating both and comparing them can be used as a primality test, specifically the [[Solovay-Strassen primality test]]. Composite numbers for which the congruence holds for a given <math>a</math> are called [[Euler\u2013Jacobi pseudoprime|Euler\u2013Jacobi pseudoprimes]] to base <math>a</math>.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\nThe ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' has been translated from Gauss's [[Classical Latin|Ciceronian Latin]] into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].

It is believed that the language bore a lot of similarities with other Northwest Indian languages like Punjabi, Sindhi and Lahanda. It's believed that there is some mention of the Khasa language in texts like [[Manusmriti]], [[Rajatarangini]] and the [[Puranas]]. The Khashas were documented to have ruled over a vast territory comprising what is now western Nepal, parts of Garhwal and Kumaon in northern India, and some parts of southwestern Tibet. King Ashoka Challa (1255\u201378 CE) is believed to have proclaimed himself Khasha-Rajadhiraja (emperor of the Khashas) in a copper-plate inscription found in [[Bodh Gaya]], and several other copper-plates in the ancient Nepali language have been traced back to the descendants of the King. \n\nThe currently popular variant of Nepali is believed to have originated around 500 years ago with the mass migration of a branch of [[Khas people]] from the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]]-[[Bheri River|Bheri]]-[[Seti River|Seti]] eastward to settle in lower valleys of the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]] and the [[Gandaki River|Gandaki]] basin that were well-suited to [[rice]] cultivation. Over the centuries, different dialects of the Nepali language with distinct influences from Sanskrit, Maithili, Hindi and Bengali are believed to have emerged across different regions of the current-day Nepal and Uttarakhand, making Khasa the [[Lingua franca|lingua franca]].\n\nHowever, the institutionalization of the Nepali language is believed to have started with the Shah kings of Gorkha Kingdom, in the modern day Gorkha district of Nepal. In 1559 AD, a prince of Lamjung, [[Dravya Shah]] established himself on the throne of Gorkha with the help of local Khas and [[Magars]]. He raised an army of khas people under the command of [[Bhagirath Panta]]. Later, in the late 18th century, his descendant, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], raised and modernised an army of [[Chhetri]], Thakuri, Magars and [[Gurung people]] among others and set out to conquer and consolidate dozens of small principalities in the Himalayas. Since Gorkha had replaced the original Khas homeland, Khaskura was redubbed ''Gorkhali'' \"language of the Gorkhas.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nOne of the most notable military achievements of Prithvi Narayan Shah was the conquest of [[Kathmandu Valley]]. This region was called ''Nepal'' at the time. After the overthrowing of the Malla rulers, Kathmandu was established as Prithvi Narayan's new capital.\n\nThe [[Khas people]] originally referred to their language as ''Khas kur\u0101'' (\"Khas speech\"), which was also known as ''Parbatiya'' (or ''Parbattia'' or ''Paharia'', meaning language of the hill country).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Balfour|first1=Edward|title=Cyclop\u00e6dia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific: Products of the Mineral, Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms, Useful Arts and Manufactures|year=1871|publisher=Scottish & Adelphi presses|page=529|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TYFRAAAAcAAJ|language=en|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cust|first1=Robert N.|title=A Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies|date=1878|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136384691|page=51|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CVOBAAAAQBAJ|language=en|via=Google Books}}</ref> The Newar people used the term \"[[Gorkhali]]\" as a name for this language, as they identified it with the Gorkhali conquerors.{{fact|date=July 2019}} The Gorkhalis themselves started using this term to refer to their language at a later stage.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=118}} The census of India prior to independence used the term ''Naipali'' at least from 1901 to 1951, the 1961 census replacing it with ''Nepali''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=General|first1=India Office of the Registrar|title=Census of India, 1961: Tripura|date=1967|publisher=Manager of Publications|page=336|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TwMfAQAAMAAJ|language=en|quote=Nepali (Naipali in 1951)|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Commissioner|first1=India Census|last2=Gait|first2=Edward Albert|title=Census of India, 1901|date=1902|publisher=Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, India|page=[https://archive.org/details/censusindia16rislgoog/page/n139 91]|url=https://archive.org/details/censusindia16rislgoog|language=en|quote=Naipali is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the upper classes in Nepal, whereas the minor Nepalese languages, such as Gurung, Magar, Jimdar, Yakha, etc., are members of the Tibeto-Burman family|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0916\u092e\u094d\u092e.jpg|alt=Earliest discovered inscription in the Khas Language|thumb|The Damupal Inscription in Dullu, Dailekh]]\nExpansion \u2013 particularly to the north, west, and south \u2013 brought the growing state into conflict with the British and the Chinese. This led to wars that trimmed back the territory to an area roughly corresponding to Nepal's present borders. After the Gorkha conquests, the Kathmandu valley or ''Nepal'' became the new center of politics. As the entire conquered territory of the Gorkhas ultimately became ''Nepal'', in the early decades of the 20th century, Gorkha language activists in India, especially Darjeeling and Varanasi, began petitioning Indian universities to adopt the name 'Nepali' for the language.<ref>Onta, Pratyoush (1996) \"Creating a Brave Nepali Nation in British India: The Rhetoric of Jati Improvement, Rediscovery of Bhanubhakta and the Writing of Bir History\" in Studies in Nepali History and Society 1(1), p. 37-76.</ref> Also in an attempt to disassociate himself with his Khas background, the Rana monarch [[Jung Bahadur Rana]] decreed that the term Gorkhali be used instead of ''Khas kur\u0101'' to describe the language.

Every consonant except [j], [w], /l/, and /\u0266/ has a [[geminate]] counterpart between vowels. /\u0273/ and /\u0283/ also exist in some loanwords such as /ba\u0273/ {{lang|ne|\u092c\u093e\u0923}} \"arrow\" and /nare\u0283/ {{lang|ne|\u0928\u0930\u0947\u0936}} \"king\", but these sounds are sometimes replaced with native Nepali phonemes.\n\nFinal schwas may or may not be preserved in speech. The following rules can be followed to figure whether or not Nepali words retain the final schwa. Nepali retains the schwa for the final syllable if:\n\n1) The syllable is a conjunct. \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924 (anta - end), \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927 (sambandha - relation), \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920 (shrestha - greatest/ a last name) Exceptions: conjuncts such as \u091e\u094d\u200d\u200d\u200d\u091c \u091e\u094d\u200d\u091a in \u092e\u091e\u094d\u200d\u091a(manc - stage) \u0917\u091e\u094d\u200d\u200d\u200d\u091c(ganj - city) and occasionally the last name \u092a\u0928\u094d\u0924 (panta/ pant)\n\n2) For any verb form the final schwa is always retained unless the schwa cancelling [[Virama|halanta]] is present. \u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u091b(huncha - it happens), \u092d\u090f\u0930(bhaera - in happening so/ therefore), \u0917\u090f\u091b(gaecha - he apparently went) but \u091b\u0928\u094d(chan - they are), \u0917\u0907\u0928\u094d(gain - she went)\n\nMeanings may change with the wrong orthography: \u0917\u0907\u0928(gaina)= she didn't go VS \u0917\u0907\u0928\u094d (gain) = she went \n3) Adverbs, onomatopoeia and postpositions usually maintain the schwa and if they don't a halanta is acquired: \u0905\u092c (aba - now), \u0924\u093f\u0930 (tira - towards), \u0906\u091c (aaja- today) \u0938\u093f\u092e\u094d\u0938\u093f\u092e\u094d (simsim - drizzle) VS \u091d\u0928\u094d (jhan- more)\n\n4) Few exceptional nouns such as: \u0926\u0941\u0916(dukha - suffering), \u0938\u0941\u0916 (sukha - pleasure)\n\n==Grammar==\n{{OR section|date=July 2019}}\nNepali is an [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] language. There are three major levels or gradation of honorific- low, medium and high. Low honorific is used where no respect is due, medium honorific is used to signify equal status or neutrality and high honorific signifies respect. There is also a separate highest level honorific, that was used to refer to members of the Royal family, and by the Royals among themselves. It is still in use by elite dynasties like Shahs, Ranas, Pandes, etc. and is increasingly being embraced by the elite class in general.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n{{expand section|date=February

It is believed that the language bore a lot of similarities with other Northwest Indian languages like Punjabi, Sindhi and Lahanda. It's believed that there is some mention of the Khasa language in texts like [[Manusmriti]], [[Rajatarangini]] and the [[Puranas]]. The Khashas were documented to have ruled over a vast territory comprising what is now western Nepal, parts of Garhwal and Kumaon in northern India, and some parts of southwestern Tibet. King Ashoka Challa (1255\u201378 CE) is believed to have proclaimed himself Khasha-Rajadhiraja (emperor of the Khashas) in a copper-plate inscription found in [[Bodh Gaya]], and several other copper-plates in the ancient Nepali language have been traced back to the descendants of the King. \n\nThe currently popular variant of Nepali is believed to have originated around 500 years ago with the mass migration of a branch of [[Khas people]] from the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]]-[[Bheri River|Bheri]]-[[Seti River|Seti]] eastward to settle in lower valleys of the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]] and the [[Gandaki River|Gandaki]] basin that were well-suited to [[rice]] cultivation. Over the centuries, different dialects of the Nepali language with distinct influences from Sanskrit, Maithili, Hindi and Bengali are believed to have emerged across different regions of the current-day Nepal and Uttarakhand, making Khasa the [[Lingua franca|lingua franca]].\n\nHowever, the institutionalization of the Nepali language is believed to have started with the Shah kings of Gorkha Kingdom, in the modern day Gorkha district of Nepal. In 1559 AD, a prince of Lamjung, [[Dravya Shah]] established himself on the throne of Gorkha with the help of local Khas and [[Magars]]. He raised an army of khas people under the command of [[Bhagirath Panta]]. Later, in the late 18th century, his descendant, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], raised and modernised an army of [[Chhetri]], Thakuri, Magars and [[Gurung people]] among others and set out to conquer and consolidate dozens of small principalities in the Himalayas. Since Gorkha had replaced the original Khas homeland, Khaskura was redubbed ''Gorkhali'' \"language of the Gorkhas.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nOne of the most notable military achievements of Prithvi Narayan Shah was the conquest of [[Kathmandu Valley]]. This region was called ''Nepal'' at the time. After the overthrowing of the Malla rulers, Kathmandu was established as Prithvi Narayan's new capital.\n\nThe [[Khas people]] originally referred to their language as ''Khas kur\u0101'' (\"Khas speech\"), which was also known as ''Parbatiya'' (or ''Parbattia'' or ''Paharia'', meaning language of the hill country).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Balfour|first1=Edward|title=Cyclop\u00e6dia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific: Products of the Mineral, Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms, Useful Arts and Manufactures|year=1871|publisher=Scottish & Adelphi presses|page=529|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TYFRAAAAcAAJ|language=en|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cust|first1=Robert N.|title=A Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies|date=1878|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136384691|page=51|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CVOBAAAAQBAJ|language=en|via=Google Books}}</ref> The Newar people used the term \"[[Gorkhali]]\" as a name for this language, as they identified it with the Gorkhali conquerors.{{fact|date=July 2019}} The Gorkhalis themselves started using this term to refer to their language at a later stage.{{sfn|Richard Burghart|1984|p=118}} The census of India prior to independence used the term ''Naipali'' at least from 1901 to 1951, the 1961 census replacing it with ''Nepali''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=General|first1=India Office of the Registrar|title=Census of India, 1961: Tripura|date=1967|publisher=Manager of Publications|page=336|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TwMfAQAAMAAJ|language=en|quote=Nepali (Naipali in 1951)|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Commissioner|first1=India Census|last2=Gait|first2=Edward Albert|title=Census of India, 1901|date=1902|publisher=Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, India|page=[https://archive.org/details/censusindia16rislgoog/page/n139 91]|url=https://archive.org/details/censusindia16rislgoog|language=en|quote=Naipali is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the upper classes in Nepal, whereas the minor Nepalese languages, such as Gurung, Magar, Jimdar, Yakha, etc., are members of the Tibeto-Burman family|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n[[File:\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0916\u092e\u094d\u092e.jpg|alt=Earliest discovered inscription in the Khas Language|thumb|The Damupal Inscription in Dullu, Dailekh]]\nExpansion \u2013 particularly to the north, west, and south \u2013 brought the growing state into conflict with the British and the Chinese.

Nepali retains the schwa for the final syllable if:\n\n1) The syllable is a conjunct. \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924 (anta - end), \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927 (sambandha - relation), \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920 (shrestha - greatest/ a last name) Exceptions: conjuncts such as \u091e\u094d\u200d\u200d\u200d\u091c \u091e\u094d\u200d\u091a in \u092e\u091e\u094d\u200d\u091a(manc - stage) \u0917\u091e\u094d\u200d\u200d\u200d\u091c(ganj - city) and occasionally the last name \u092a\u0928\u094d\u0924 (panta/ pant)\n\n2) For any verb form the final schwa is always retained unless the schwa cancelling [[Virama|halanta]] is present. \u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u091b(huncha - it happens), \u092d\u090f\u0930(bhaera - in happening so/ therefore), \u0917\u090f\u091b(gaecha - he apparently went) but \u091b\u0928\u094d(chan - they are), \u0917\u0907\u0928\u094d(gain - she went)\n\nMeanings may change with the wrong orthography: \u0917\u0907\u0928(gaina)= she didn't go VS \u0917\u0907\u0928\u094d (gain) = she went \n3) Adverbs, onomatopoeia and postpositions usually maintain the schwa and if they don't a halanta is acquired: \u0905\u092c (aba - now), \u0924\u093f\u0930 (tira - towards), \u0906\u091c (aaja- today) \u0938\u093f\u092e\u094d\u0938\u093f\u092e\u094d (simsim - drizzle) VS \u091d\u0928\u094d (jhan- more)\n\n4) Few exceptional nouns such as: \u0926\u0941\u0916(dukha - suffering), \u0938\u0941\u0916 (sukha - pleasure)\n\n==Grammar==\n{{OR section|date=July 2019}}\nNepali is an [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] language. There are three major levels or gradation of honorific- low, medium and high. Low honorific is used where no respect is due, medium honorific is used to signify equal status or neutrality and high honorific signifies respect. There is also a separate highest level honorific, that was used to refer to members of the Royal family, and by the Royals among themselves. It is still in use by elite dynasties like Shahs, Ranas, Pandes, etc. and is increasingly being embraced by the elite class in general.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n{{expand section|date=February

Measures include the [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], [[protein efficiency ratio]], [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score|protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score]] and [[Complete protein|complete proteins concept]]. These concepts are important in the [[animal husbandry|livestock industry]], because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in [[fodder|animal feeds]] would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on [[feed conversion ratio]]. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.\n\n===Protein per calorie===\nProtein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie.

This led [[William Cumming Rose]] to the discovery of the essential amino acid [[threonine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rose WC, Haines WJ, Warner DT, Johnson JE |title=The amino acid requirements of man.

Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants.

The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Effects of deficiency==\n{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}\nIf one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than adequate.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut [[mucosal]] function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to [[systemic disease]]; and kidney function.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low [[serum albumin]] and low [[serum transferrin]].<ref name=\"DRI\" />\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by [[William Cumming Rose]]. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of [[Corn starch|cornstarch]], [[sucrose]], [[butterfat]] without protein, [[corn oil]], inorganic salts, the known [[vitamin]]s, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with [[peppermint oil]] (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was [[nitrogen balance]]. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=WC |last2=Haines |first2=WJ |last3=Warner |first3=DT |title=The amino acid requirements of man.

Mexican corn and beans, Japanese rice and soybeans, and Cajun red beans and rice are examples of such fortuitous combinations.\"</ref> The official position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from an appropriate planned combination of a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day can be nutritionally adequate when caloric requirements are met.<ref name=Vesanto2016/>\n\n===Protein quality===\n{{Main|Protein quality}}\n\nVarious attempts have been made to express the \"quality\" or \"value\" of various kinds of protein. Measures include the [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], [[protein efficiency ratio]], [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score|protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score]] and [[Complete protein|complete proteins concept]]. These concepts are important in the [[animal husbandry|livestock industry]], because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in [[fodder|animal feeds]] would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on [[feed conversion ratio]]. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.\n\n===Protein per calorie===\nProtein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie. For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84&nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total).<ref>{{cite book |title=SDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference |date=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |edition=Release 21}}</ref>  For comparison, there are 2.8 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (100 grams) or 82&nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (34 calories total), or the [[Daily Value]] of 47.67g of protein after eating 1,690g of raw broccoli a day at 574 cal.<ref name=Broccoli>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Broccoli%2C_raw_nutritional_value.html |title=Broccoli, raw: nutritional value and analysis |last=Vanovschi |first=Vitalii |website=www.nutritionvalue.org |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> An egg contains 12.5g of protein per 100g, but 4&nbsp;mg more protein per calorie, or the protein DV after 381g of egg, which is 545 cal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Egg%2C_poached%2C_cooked%2C_whole_nutritional_value.html |title=Egg, poached, cooked, whole: nutritional value and analysis |last=Vanovschi |first=Vitalii |website=www.nutritionvalue.org |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account, one would actually need to eat more than 3kg of broccoli a day to have a healthy protein profile, and almost 6kg to get enough calories.<ref name=Broccoli/> It is recommended that adult humans obtain between 10\u201335% of their 2000 calories a day as protein.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/protein |title=Web MD Protein: Are You Getting Enough? |publisher=webmd.com |date=2014-09-05 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Complete proteins in non-human animals==\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was [[zein]], which comes from [[maize]] (corn), but recovered if they were fed [[casein]] from cow's milk. This led [[William Cumming Rose]] to the discovery of the essential amino acid [[threonine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rose WC, Haines WJ, Warner DT, Johnson JE |title=The amino acid requirements of man. II. The role of threonine and histidine |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=188 |issue=1 |pages=49\u201358 |pmid=14814112 |year=1951}}</ref> Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: [[lysine]], [[tryptophan]], [[histidine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[methionine]], [[valine]], and [[arginine]], in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kopple JD, Swendseid ME |date=May 1975 |title=Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=881\u2013891 |pmid=1123426 |pmc=301830 |doi=10.1172/JCI108016}}</ref>\n\n==Interchangeability==\nThe distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Effects of deficiency==\n{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}\nIf one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than adequate.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut [[mucosal]] function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to [[systemic disease]]; and kidney function.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low [[serum albumin]] and low [[serum transferrin]].<ref name=\"DRI\" />\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by [[William Cumming Rose]]. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of [[Corn starch|cornstarch]], [[sucrose]], [[butterfat]] without protein, [[corn oil]], inorganic salts, the known [[Vitamin|vitamins]], a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with [[peppermint oil]] (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was [[nitrogen balance]]. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=WC |last2=Haines |first2=WJ |last3=Warner |first3=DT |title=The amino acid requirements of man.

Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] (Robbie) and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]] (Zawierucha), have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]]. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].\n\nThe next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] (Herriman) stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|music producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]] (Hirsch). Tate goes out for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\nDalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer. He subsequently delivers a performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence. \n\nWhile driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]] (Dern), Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|\"Squeaky\" Fromme]]'s (Fanning) objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.\n\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks.

They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation. Sadie stumbles outside, alarming Dalton, who is in his pool listening to music on headphones, oblivious to the mayhem. Dalton retrieves a flamethrower that he had previously used in a movie and incinerates Sadie.

While he knew he wanted the work to be titled ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'', evoking the idea of a fairy tale set in 1960s Hollywood, he publicly referred to the project as ''Magnum Opus''.<ref name=\"esquire may2019\">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27458589/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-interview/ | title = Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio Take You Inside 'Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood' | first = Michael | last = Hainey | date = May 21, 2019 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | magazine = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel,<ref name=\"esquire may2019\"/> which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story he wanted to tell, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\"/>\n\nTarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.<ref name=recut/> Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, \"this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together\".<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title =Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nTarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows.

To prepare for her audition, [[Maya Hawke]] practiced with her father, [[Ethan Hawke]]. She said the process was unlike any other except maybe auditioning for drama school, and during it they worked on the scene in many different ways, with different combinations of people. Willis auditioned for two roles, neither of which she got, then was offered the part of [[Joanna Pettet]]. [[Sydney Sweeney]] said everyone she auditioned with did so for the same character, then were told they could do extra credit. Some did artwork, and she wrote a letter in character. [[Julia Butters]] says her sitcom ''[[American Housewife]]'' was on while Tarantino was writing her character, Trudi Fraser.

While filming at [[Musso & Frank Grill]], the owners brought out the original plates.\n\nTo film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's [[LED]] signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them. Stan's Donuts, across the street from the Bruin got a complete makeover.<ref name=\"afar\">{{cite news |last=Wakim |first=Marielle |url=https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |title='Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' Filming Locations You Can Visit in Los Angeles |website=[[Afar (magazine)|Afar]] |access-date=September 2, 2019 |date=July 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903051130/https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |archive-date=September 3, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nTarantino was adamant about filming at the real [[Playboy Mansion]], but it took a long time to obtain permission since by the time of pre-production the mansion had been sold to a private owner following [[Hugh Hefner]]'s death. Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss the parts of the property which they wanted to use, but he was reluctant since the property was in the middle of a renovation. After long negotiations he agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.<ref name=recreating-Hollywood/>\n\nFor ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Ling's team found one of the last great living Italian artists to do two of the film's posters. Other posters used and the mugs, are part of Tarantino's personal collection. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill. Spahn Ranch was recreated in detail over about a three-month period.

For ''Bounty Law'' they shot in black and white, and brief sequences in [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] and [[16mm]] [[Ektachrome]]. In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, \"The film speaks to all of us...

Casting agent Marvin Schwarz (Pacino) recommends he make [[Spaghetti Western]]s in Italy, which Dalton feels are beneath him.

Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] (Robbie) and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]] (Zawierucha), have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]]. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].\n\nThe next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] (Herriman) stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|music producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]] (Hirsch). Tate goes out for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\nDalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer. He subsequently delivers a performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence. \n\nWhile driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]] (Dern), Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|\"Squeaky\" Fromme]]'s (Fanning) objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.\n\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members Tex, [[Susan Atkins|Sadie]], [[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]] arrive outside in preparation to [[Tate\u2013LaBianca murders|murder everyone in Tate's house]]. Dalton hears the car and orders them to get off his street. [[Alternate history|Changing their plans]], the Manson Family members decide to instead kill Dalton after Sadie reasons that Hollywood has \"taught them to murder.\" Flower Child deserts the group, speeding off with their car. They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation. Sadie stumbles outside, alarming Dalton, who is in his pool listening to music on headphones, oblivious to the mayhem. Dalton retrieves a flamethrower that he had previously used in a movie and incinerates Sadie. After Booth is taken to the hospital to treat his injuries, Sebring engages Dalton in conversation outside and Dalton receives an invitation to have a drink with Tate and her friends at her house, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Rick Dalton\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Cliff Booth\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Sharon Tate]]\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Jay Sebring]]\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as \"Pussycat\"\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[James Stacy]]\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Trudi Fraser\n* [[Austin Butler]] as \"[[Tex Watson|Tex]]\"\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as \"[[Lynette Fromme|Squeaky]]\"\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as [[George Spahn]]\n* [[Mike Moh]] as [[Bruce Lee]]\n* [[Luke Perry]] as [[Wayne Maunder]]\n* [[Damian Lewis]] as [[Steve McQueen]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Marvin Schwarz\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as [[Sam Wanamaker]]\n* [[Samantha Robinson (American actress)|Samantha Robinson]] as [[Abigail Folger]]\n* [[Rafa\u0142 Zawierucha]] as [[Roman Polanski]]\n* [[Lorenza Izzo]] as Francesca Capucci\n* [[Costa Ronin]] as [[Wojciech Frykowski]]\n* [[Damon Herriman]] as [[Charles Manson|Charlie]]\n* [[Lena Dunham]] as \"[[Catherine Share|Gypsy]]\"\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as \"[[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]]\"\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as \"[[Susan Atkins|Sadie]]\"\n* James Landry H\u00e9bert as \"[[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan|Clem]]\"\n* [[Maya Hawke]] as \"[[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]]\"\n* [[Victoria Pedretti]] as \"[[Leslie Van Houten|Lulu]]\"\n* [[Sydney Sweeney]] as \"[[:de:Diane Lake|Snake]]\"\n* [[Harley Quinn Smith]] as \"Froggie\"\n* Dallas Jay Hunter as \"Delilah\"\n* [[Kansas Bowling]] as \"[[Sandra Good|Blue]]\"\n* Parker Love Bowling as \"Tadpole\"\n* Cassidy Vick Hice as \"Sundance\"\n* Ruby Rose Skotchdopole as \"Butterfly\"\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as \"Angel\"\n* Josephine Valentina Clark as \"Happy Cappy\"\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as \"Business\" Bob Gilbert on ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]''\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Ernesto \"The Mexican\" Vaquero on ''Lancer''\n* [[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodr\u00edguez]] as the [[bartender]] on ''Lancer''\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Franco (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Franco]] as a Land Pirate on ''Lancer'' and Rub\u00e9n, the [[Bruin Theater]] manager\n* Raul Cardona as \"Bad Guy\" Delgado on ''Lancer''\n* Courtney Hoffman as Rebekka\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as [[Connie Stevens]]\n* Rachel Redleaf as [[Cass Elliot|Mama Cass]]\n* [[Rebecca Rittenhouse]] as [[Michelle Phillips]]\n* [[Rumer Willis]] as [[Joanna Pettet]]\n* [[Spencer Garrett]] as Allen Kincade\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as the Larry Edmunds Bookshop owner\n* [[Martin Kove]] as a ''Bounty Law'' Sheriff\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as Billie Booth\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Randy Miller and the narrator\n* [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] as Janet Miller\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Sheriff Hackett on ''Bounty Law''\n* [[Perla Haney-Jardine]] as a hippie drug dealer\n* [[James Remar]] as \"Ugly Owl\" Hoot on ''Bounty Law''\n* [[Monica Staggs]] as Connie\n* [[Omar Doom]] as Donnie\n* [[Kate Berlant]] as the Bruin Theater ticket booth attendant\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Mary Alice Schwarz\n* [[Daniella Pick]] as Daphna Ben-Cobo\n* Tom Hartig as [[Altamont Free Concert|Bill \"Sweet William\" Fritsch]]\n* [[David Steen (actor)|David Steen]] as Straight Satan David\n* [[Corey Burton]] as the ''Bounty Law'' promo announcer\n* [[Toni Basil]] as a dancer on the plane during the opening credits sequence<ref name=toni-basil>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/dance/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-toni-basil.html |title=Quentin Tarantino's Goddess of Go-Go |first=Debra |last=Levine |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 6, 2019 |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806163003/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/dance/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-toni-basil.html |archive-date=August 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Rage Stewart as [[KHJ (AM)|Harvey \"Humble Harve\" Miller]]\n* [[Quentin Tarantino]] as the offscreen director of the Red Apple cigarettes TV commercial.

While he knew he wanted the work to be titled ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'', evoking the idea of a fairy tale set in 1960s Hollywood, he publicly referred to the project as ''Magnum Opus''.<ref name=\"esquire may2019\">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27458589/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-interview/ | title = Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio Take You Inside 'Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood' | first = Michael | last = Hainey | date = May 21, 2019 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | magazine = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel,<ref name=\"esquire may2019\"/> which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story he wanted to tell, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\"/>\n\nTarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.<ref name=recut/> Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, \"this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together\".<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title =Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nTarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows. Tarantino has expressed interest in turning these five scripts, as well as ideas for three more, into an actual ''Bounty Law'' television series in the future.<ref name=Tarantino-Deadline-Interview/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nOn July 11, 2017, it was announced that [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s next film would be about the [[Manson Family]] murders.

To prepare for her audition, [[Maya Hawke]] practiced with her father, [[Ethan Hawke]]. She said the process was unlike any other except maybe auditioning for drama school, and during it they worked on the scene in many different ways, with different combinations of people.

While filming at [[Musso & Frank Grill]], the owners brought out the original plates.\n\nTo film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's [[LED]] signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them.

Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss their plans and the parts of the property which they wanted to use. After long negotiations the owner agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.<ref name=recreating-Hollywood/>\n\nFor ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Ling's team found one of the last great living Italian artists to do two of the film's posters. Other posters used and the mugs, are part of Tarantino's personal collection. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill.

In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, \"The film speaks to all of us...

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]].

[[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]].

[[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. [[Energy pyramid]]s, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included, since this is dictated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].\"<ref name=\"Odum05\">{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.
