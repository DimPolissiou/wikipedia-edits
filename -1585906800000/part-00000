Then, it takes it straight to the one and only Kumar ShivRam Kishan\u2019s life. It has been shown how Kumar marries three different women in an accidental way \u2013 Juhi, Anjali and Simran \u2013 in order to prevent them from committing suicide. Without letting them know about each other, he makes excuses to spend one night with each wife. On the advice of his friend, Karan, he buys three flats on different floors of the same building for his wives, and Kumar and Karan experience unlikely situations as a result.\n\nKumar also has a girlfriend, Deepika, who he wants to marry, and Deepika's father accepts Kumar as his son-in-law. One evening before [[Karva Chauth]] (a one-day festival where women fast for the safety of their husbands), Deepika's father sees Kumar with his three wives, one-at-a-time, but Kumar passes it off as an April Fool trick played by the women. Deepika's father again suspects Kumar when he sees Kumar's photo and believes him to be engaged to a female employee. Deepika and Kumar decide to marry in court to avoid tensions. However, another complication arises as Kumar's estranged parents reconcile, realize they each know their son to have a different wife, then learn he's to marry Deepika.\n\nKaran and Deepika wait a long time at the courthouse; when Kumar does arrive, he sees his three wives \u2013 who have become good friends with Deepika \u2013 and has to hide. Karan tells Deepika and the wives that the groom went to a hospital to help a friend, and to postpone the marriage by two days. The wives leave and Kumar comes out saying it's okay and they can marry, stopping Deepika when she tries to call her friends. He suggests going to a temple to marry, and sends Karan to bring what they'll need.\n\nDeepika's father brings Kumar and Deepika to his office and confronts his employee. The woman denies that Kumar is her fianc\u00e9, and Deepika's father realizes the photo had been left by his daughter. Deepika's father decides to fire his employee for making him doubt his future son-in-law, but Kumar saves her job and Deepika's father decides to celebrate the marriage.\n\nEveryone arrives on the day of the marriage, all made to wear [[Indian wedding clothes|marriage clothes]] so that they can't recognize Kumar or each other. However, Anjali's brother Tiger Bhai is in search of a guy, and makes everyone to put down their ''[[Pagri (turban)|pagri]]'' (turbans, with veils concealing their faces).  Kumar hesitates when it is his turn, but Tiger's men bring the guy and Kumar is spared.\n\nThe marriage ceremony continues. By chance, Kumar's face passes in front of a fire and he is exposed. Kumar explains that he didn't break heart with his three wives \u2013 that they forcefully made him marry, without listening to him or asking if he was married, that he couldn't leave them to commit suicide, and confesses his deep regret at breaking the heart of his true love, Deepika. Everyone cries and Kumar's mother hugs him tightly while Deepika's father asks Deepika for her choice.  At the end, all four wives are shown accepting each other, with only Tiger left in confusion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] as Shivkumar Ramkrishan Punj alias Kumar alias Shiv\n* [[Sai Lokur]] as Anjali Punj\n* [[Jamie Lever]] as Champa\n* [[Elli Avram]] as Deepika Punj\n* [[Simran Kaur Mundi]] as Simran Punj\n* [[Manjari Fadnis]] as Juhi Punj<ref>[http://www.koimoi.com/movie/kis-kisko-pyaar-karoon/?type=review Movie Review:Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon].

Kumar explains that he didn't break heart with his three wives \u2013 that they forcefully made him marry, without listening to him or asking if he was married, that he couldn't leave them to commit suicide, and confesses his deep regret at breaking the heart of his true love, Deepika. Everyone cries and Kumar's mother hugs him tightly while Deepika's father asks Deepika for her choice.  At the end, all four wives are shown accepting each other, with only Tiger left in confusion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] as Shivkumar Ramkrishan Punj alias Kumar alias Shiv\n* [[Sai Lokur]] as Anjali Punj\n* [[Jamie Lever]] as Champa\n* [[Elli Avram]] as Deepika Punj\n* [[Simran Kaur Mundi]] as Simran Punj\n* [[Manjari Fadnis]] as Juhi Punj<ref>[http://www.koimoi.com/movie/kis-kisko-pyaar-karoon/?type=review Movie Review:Kis Kisko Pyaar Karoon].

According to the Demographic research group in 2017, there are 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the \"urban area\", as defined by the group's methodology.<ref name=\"demographia\">{{cite news|title=More than 100 Chinese cities now above 1 million people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/20/china-100-cities-populations-bigger-liverpool|publisher=Guardian|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAccording to the [[administrative divisions of China]], there are three levels of cities, namely [[Direct-controlled municipality of China|municipalities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02}}), [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02}}), and [[county-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02}}). The [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions (S.A.R.s)]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] are not included in this administrative classification.\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a \"city\" in the strictest sense of the term, but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, both an urban core (''a city in the strict sense'') and surrounding [[rural]] or less-urbanized areas usually many times the size of the central, built-up core.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=L.|last2=Zhao|first2=Simon X. B.|date=June 1998|title=Re-examining China's \u201cUrban\u201d Concept and the Level of Urbanization|journal=The China Quarterly|language=en|volume=154|pages=330\u2013381|doi=10.1017/S030574100000206X}}</ref>\n\nPrefecture-level cities nearly always contain multiple [[Counties of China|counties]], [[county-level cities]], and other such sub-divisions. To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (''city in the strict sense''), the term \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u5e02\u533a}}\" (''sh\u00ecq\u016b''; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ecq\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== List of major cities by population ==\nThe list contains all the cities with the administrative designation \"[[National Central City|National Central Cities]]\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57ce\u5e02}}) and

populous country]]. According to the Demographic research group in 2017, there are 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the \"urban area\", as defined by the group's methodology.<ref name=\"demographia\">{{cite news|title=More than 100 Chinese cities now above 1 million people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/20/china-100-cities-populations-bigger-liverpool|publisher=Guardian|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAccording to the [[administrative divisions of China]], there are three levels of cities, namely [[Direct-controlled municipality of China|municipalities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02}}), [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02}}), and [[county-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02}}). The [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions (S.A.R.s)]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] are not included in this administrative classification.\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a \"city\" in the strictest sense of the term, but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, both an urban core (''a city in the strict sense'') and surrounding [[rural]] or less-urbanized areas usually many times the size of the central, built-up core.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=L.|last2=Zhao|first2=Simon X. B.|date=June 1998|title=Re-examining China's \u201cUrban\u201d Concept and the Level of Urbanization|journal=The China Quarterly|language=en|volume=154|pages=330\u2013381|doi=10.1017/S030574100000206X}}</ref>\n\nPrefecture-level cities nearly always contain multiple [[Counties of China|counties]], [[county-level cities]], and other such sub-divisions. To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (''city in the strict sense''), the term \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u5e02\u533a}}\" (''sh\u00ecq\u016b''; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ecq\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== List of major cities by population ==\nThe list contains all cities with the administrative designation \"[[sub-provincial division|sub-provincial city]]\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u526f\u7701\u7ea7\u57ce\u5e02}}) \u2013 either
