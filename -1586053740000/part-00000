It rises in the eastern slopes of [[Mount Ruapehu]], joining the [[Tongariro River]] system and flowing through [[Lake Taupo]], New Zealand's largest lake. It then drains Taupo at the lake's northeastern edge, creates the [[Huka Falls]], and flows northwest through the [[Waikato Plains]]. It empties into the [[Tasman Sea]] south of [[Auckland]], at [[Port Waikato]]. It gives its name to the [[Waikato]] region that surrounds the Waikato Plains. The present course of the river was largely formed about 17,000 years ago. Contributing factors were climate warming, forest being reestablished in the river headwaters and the deepening, rather than widening, of the existing river channel. The channel was gradually eroded as far up river as [[Piarere]], leaving the old Hinuera channel through the [[Hinuera Gap]] high and dry.<ref>The Wandering River . Landforms and geological history of the Hamilton Basin. P 36-37. John McCaw. Geoscience Society of NZ Handbook No 16. 2011. Graphic Press . Levin. NZ.</ref>  The remains of the old river path can be clearly seen at [[Hinuera]] where the cliffs mark the ancient river edges. The river's main tributary is the [[Waipa River]], which has its confluence with the Waikato at [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]].\n\nThe name ''Waikato'' comes from the [[M\u0101ori language]] and translates as ''flowing water''.<ref name=1966Encyc>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/waikato-river/1 |title=Waikato River |encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|year=1966}}</ref> The Waikato River has [[Spirituality|spiritual]] meaning for various local [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[tribe]]s, including the large [[Tainui]], who regard it as a source of their [[mana]], or pride. The widely respected [[marae]] of [[T\u016brangawaewae]] is close to its banks at Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia.\n\nFor many years Tainui tribe have sought to re-establish their links to the river after the [[New Zealand Wars]] (see [[Invasion of the Waikato]]) and the subsequent confiscations of the 1860s, and are continuing negotiations with the [[New Zealand government]]. The Tainui iwi was advised not to bring a case for the river before the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] as they would not win. An out of court settlement was arranged and the deed of settlement signed by the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in August 2008 settled the [[raupatu]] claim to the Waikato River, although other claims for land blocks and harbours are still outstanding. Waikato-Tainui now have joint management of the river with the [[Waikato Regional Council]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe ancestral Waikato River flowed from an ancient lake (Lake Huka) in the centre of the North Island through deep gorges of welded [[ignimbrite]] and [[rhyolite]], northward through the Hinuera Valley and Hauraki Basin into the Thames Estuary. It is possible that the river flowed through the Waikato Basin about a million years ago before returning to its Hinuera course. After the huge [[Oruanui eruption]] 27,000 years ago ignimbrite was showered all over the North Island to a thickness of {{convert|200|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite journal| url=| title=The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: an introduction and overview| first=C J N| last=Wilson| journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research| volume=112| date=December 2001| pages=113\u2013174| issue=1| doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(01)00239-6}}</ref> A new lake was formed - [[Lake Taupo]]. The water built up until a new outlet was forced {{convert|120|m|ft}} above the present level near Waihora Bay. Over the next few thousand years the bed of the river was raised by large amounts of eruption debris. Then the original blocked entry suddenly gave way; the lake level fell {{convert|75|m|ft}} as about {{convert|80|km3|mi3}} of water and debris poured out in a catastrophic breakthrough flood causing the river to change course near [[Piarere]]. The [[Hinuera Gap]] and [[Waitoa River]] are evidence of the river's former course. The water level dropped quickly and the river stayed in this new course through the Maungatautari gorge and Hamilton Basin. Deposits show that the Waikato River was already in the Waikato Basin 21,800 years ago.<ref>The Wandering River. John McCaw. Geoscience Society of NZ.p19. Graphic Print and Packaging.

The Waikato River in Hamilton is frequently used by rowers, kayakers and powered pleasure craft. Water-skiers and jet skis have zones outside the city limits where they can be used.\n\nThe river was of military importance in the land wars between New Zealand settler and [[Kingitanga]] forces during 1863\u201364 and significant battles were fought. Three shallow draft gunboats were designed in New Zealand and built in Sydney in kitset form. In addition locally sourced barges were rebuilt with steel plating to carry troops and supplies. In support of these invasions, New Zealand developed its first \"navy\", the [[Early naval vessels of New Zealand#Waikato Flotilla|Waikato Flotilla]], run by an Australian Francis Cadell who was recognised for his spendid service by the presentation by the New Zealand government of a gold watch and diamonds.

These were constructed between 1929 and 1971 to meet growing demand for electricity.\n\nThe power scheme begins at Lake Taupo, which has control gates to regulate the flow of water into the river. Once released through the gates it takes over 18 hours for the water to flow to the last power station at Karapiro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mightyriverpower.co.nz/Generation/AboutUs/HydroStations/Taupo/ |title=Mighty River Power Generation: About Us: Taupo |publisher=Mighty River Power |accessdate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> On its journey downstream it passes through power stations at [[Aratiatia Power Station|Aratiatia]], [[Ohakuri Power Station|Ohakuri]], [[Atiamuri Power Station|Atiamuri]], [[Whakamaru Power Station|Whakamaru]], [[Maraetai Power Station|Maraetai]], [[Waipapa Power Station|Waipapa]], [[Arapuni Power Station|Arapuni]] and [[Karapiro Power Station|Karapiro]].\n\nApproximately 4000 [[Watt-hour|gigawatt hours]] (GWh) of electricity is generated annually by the scheme, which is around 13% of New Zealand's total electrical generating capacity.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe river also provides cooling water for the [[coal]]/[[natural gas]] fired [[thermal power station]] at [[Huntly Power Station|Huntly]]. The power station uses river water as a cooling medium for the old steam units, which means that large quantities of warm water is returned to the river. To limit environmental impacts, conditions are imposed by its [[Resource Management Act 1991|resource consent]], specifying the quantity of water that can be removed by the station along with the maximum temperature of the water when returned to the river, {{convert|25|C|F}}. These conditions mean that output of the older steam units can be restricted, especially on very hot summer days. In 2006, a [[cooling tower]] was installed. This allows one 250 MW unit to run at full load even during such times.<ref>{{citation | url=https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/documents/10180/14574/Huntly+Environmental+Report+2014+1.pdf| title=2013\u20132014 Huntly Power Station Environmental Report| date=24 November 2014| publisher=Genesis Energy}}</ref>[[File:Lake Karapiro boat (73761064).jpg|thumb|right|A boat on [[Lake Karapiro]]]]\n\n=== Recreation ===\nThe lower Waikato is popular amongst [[waterfowl hunting|duck shooters]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fishandgame.org.nz/auckland/game-bird-hunting-in-new-zealand/hunting-locations-and-access/|title=Hunting Locations|website=Fish & Game|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==== Boating ====\nThe Waikato is renowned among [[whitewater kayaking]] enthusiasts, specifically for the Full James rapid located north of Taupo.

Hamilton city has one of the most modern water treatment systems in the world following a 2003 report by GHB water consultants. In 2007 $22 million was spent upgrading the existing intake station south of the city at Riverlea. This will meet the cities demand until 2016. Waste water in its untreated state is 99.9% water and 0.1% other matter. A series of sophisticated machines produce clean water of a high standard getting rid of bad tastes odours and toxins to meet the upgraded NZ water standards. The Pukete 2 project which started in 2002 will upgrade the plant in a series of stages costing $24 million.\n\nA further issue is industrial and metropolitan waste from early-established [[landfill]]s and waste-emitting factories on the banks of the river. These include an unlined waste dump at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose [[leachate]]s include [[persistent organic pollutant]]s such as [[dieldrin]] in quantities toxic to freshwater marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website. In 2002 dead [[eel]]s were found in a tributary of the river when a container of pesticides and other chemicals was apparently illegally dumped. The chemicals were diluted when they entered the much bigger Waikato River. The harmful effect was temporary.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of rivers of New Zealand]]\n*[[List of rivers of New Zealand by length]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environment/Natural-resources/Water/Rivers/River-levels-and-rainfall/ Waikato River Basin Flow Rates and Rainfall.]\n* [http://www.hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145827030/Live_City_Cameras Hamilton City Council's Waikato River webcam]\n* [https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19381215.2.145 1938 photo of Manuwai part sunken beside Hamilton traffic bridge]\n\n{{Waikato|state=expanded}}\n\n{{coord|37.3694|S|174.708|E|source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Waikato River| Waikato River]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Waikato]]\n[[Category:Rivers of New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox river\n | name              = Waikato River \n | image             = Waikato_river_750px.jpg\n | image_caption     = Waikato River passing through [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]\n | map               = Waikato.png\n | map_caption       = The Waikato River ([http://u.osmfr.org/m/391177/ interactive map])\n | source1_location  = [[Lake Taupo]]\n | mouth_location    = [[Port Waikato]]\n | subdivision_type1 = Country\n | subdivision_name1 = New Zealand\n | length            = {{convert|425|km|mi}}\n | mouth_elevation   = {{convert|0.0|m|ft|0}}\n | basin_size        = {{convert|13701|km2|abbr=on}} to Mercer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.govt.nz/Environmental-information/ |title=Environment |publisher=Environment Waikato |accessdate= 2010-05-28 }}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''Waikato River''' is the longest river in New Zealand, running for {{convert|425|km|mi}} through the [[North Island]]. It rises in the eastern slopes of [[Mount Ruapehu]], joining the [[Tongariro River]] system and flowing through [[Lake Taupo]], New Zealand's largest lake. It then drains Taupo at the lake's northeastern edge, creates the [[Huka Falls]], and flows northwest through the [[Waikato Plains]]. It empties into the [[Tasman Sea]] south of [[Auckland]], at [[Port Waikato]]. It gives its name to the [[Waikato]] region that surrounds the Waikato Plains. The present course of the river was largely formed about 17,000 years ago. Contributing factors were climate warming, forest being reestablished in the river headwaters and the deepening, rather than widening, of the existing river channel. The channel was gradually eroded as far up river as [[Piarere]], leaving the old Hinuera channel through the [[Hinuera Gap]] high and dry.<ref>The Wandering River .

The river's main tributary is the [[Waipa River]], which has its confluence with the Waikato at [[Ngaruawahia]].\n\nThe name ''Waikato'' comes from the [[M\u0101ori language]] and translates as ''flowing water''.<ref name=1966Encyc>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/waikato-river/1 |title=Waikato River |encyclopedia=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]|year=1966}}</ref> The Waikato River has [[Spirituality|spiritual]] meaning for various local [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[tribe]]s, including the large [[Tainui]], who regard it as a source of their [[mana]], or pride. The widely respected [[marae]] of [[T\u016brangawaewae]] is close to its banks at Ngaruawahia.\n\nFor many years Tainui tribe have sought to re-establish their links to the river after the [[New Zealand Wars]] (see [[Invasion of the Waikato]]) and the subsequent confiscations of the 1860s, and are continuing negotiations with the [[New Zealand government]]. The Tainui iwi was advised not to bring a case for the river before the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] as they would not win. An out of court settlement was arranged and the deed of settlement signed by the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in August 2008 settled the [[raupatu]] claim to the Waikato River, although other claims for land blocks and harbours are still outstanding. Waikato-Tainui now have joint management of the river with the [[Waikato Regional Council]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe ancestral Waikato River flowed from an ancient lake (Lake Huka) in the centre of the North Island through deep gorges of welded [[ignimbrite]] and [[rhyolite]], northward through the Hinuera Valley and Hauraki Basin into the Thames Estuary. It is possible that the river flowed through the Waikato Basin about a million years ago before returning to its Hinuera course. After the huge [[Oruanui eruption]] 27,000 years ago ignimbrite was showered all over the North Island to a thickness of {{convert|200|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite journal| url=| title=The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: an introduction and overview| first=C J N| last=Wilson| journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research| volume=112| date=December 2001| pages=113\u2013174| issue=1| doi=10.1016/S0377-0273(01)00239-6}}</ref> A new lake was formed - [[Lake Taupo]]. The water built up until a new outlet was forced {{convert|120|m|ft}} above the present level near Waihora Bay. Over the next few thousand years the bed of the river was raised by large amounts of eruption debris. Then the original blocked entry suddenly gave way; the lake level fell {{convert|75|m|ft}} as about {{convert|80|km3|mi3}} of water and debris poured out in a catastrophic breakthrough flood causing the river to change course near [[Piarere]]. The [[Hinuera Gap]] and [[Waitoa River]] are evidence of the river's former course. The water level dropped quickly and the river stayed in this new course through the Maungatautari gorge and Hamilton Basin.

Due to the agricultural activity within the catchment significant [[agricultural pollution]] is [[Leaching (agriculture)|leached]] into groundwater and contained in the [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. The mismanagement of [[Fertilizer#Nitrogen fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizer]] and [[effluent spreading]] practices in [[dairy farming]] is seen as the major causes of this pollution. Since 2000 Environment Waikato has joined with conservation minded farmers to bring about more efficient and scientific use of fertilizers.\n\nThe removal of the native vegetation throughout the catchment to accommodate the increasing demand for farmland has contributed to the silting-up of the river with loose soils from eroded farmland, although most of the silting is due to the construction of the many hydrodams. In its pre-1930s wild state, the silt was flushed from the river every winter by flood surges. The remnants of these can be seen in the silt channels carved out of what is now St Andrews golf course, adjacent to the river in Hamilton.\n\n[[Arsenic]] is also a major problem and the concentration reaches 0.035&nbsp;grams of arsenic per cubic metre in places,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.govt.nz/Environmental-information/Rivers-lakes-and-wetlands/healthyrivers/Waikato-River/How-clean-is-the-Waikato-River/ |title=How clean is the Waikato River? |publisher=Environment Waikato|accessdate=2010-02-09 }}</ref> greatly exceeding the [[WHO]] provisional guideline of 0.01&nbsp;grams of arsenic per cubic metre.<ref>''Guidelines for drinking water quality'', Vol. 1, 3rd ed. \u2013 World Health Organization, (2006)</ref> The majority of arsenic in the Waikato River comes from the [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei Geothermal Power Station]].

Hamilton city has one of the most modern water treatment systems in the world following a 2003 report by GHB water consultants. In 2007 $22 million was spent upgrading the existing intake station south of the city at Riverlea. This will meet the cities demand until 2016. Waste water in its untreated state is 99.9% water and 0.1% other matter. A series of sophisticated machines produce clean water of a high standard getting rid of bad tastes odours and toxins to meet the upgraded NZ water standards. The Pukete 2 project which started in 2002 will upgrade the plant in a series of stages costing $24 million.\n\nA further issue is industrial and metropolitan waste from early-established [[landfill]]s and waste-emitting factories on the banks of the river. These include an unlined waste dump at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose [[leachate]]s include [[persistent organic pollutant]]s such as [[dieldrin]] in quantities toxic to freshwater marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website. In 2002 dead [[eel]]s were found in a tributary of the river when a container of pesticides and other chemicals was apparently illegally dumped. The chemicals were diluted when they entered the much bigger Waikato River. The harmful effect was temporary.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of rivers of New Zealand]]\n*[[List of rivers of New Zealand by length]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Environment/Natural-resources/Water/Rivers/River-levels-and-rainfall/ Waikato River Basin Flow Rates and Rainfall.]\n* [http://www.hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145827030/Live_City_Cameras Hamilton City Council's Waikato River webcam]\n* [https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19381215.2.145 1938 photo of Manuwai part sunken beside Hamilton traffic bridge]\n\n{{Waikato|state=expanded}}\n\n{{coord|37.3694|S|174.708|E|source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Waikato River| Waikato River]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Waikato]]\n[[Category:Rivers of New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Onco p53", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: Ngaruawahia \u2192 Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia (8)   as perWikipedia:Naming_conventions_(New_Zealand)and https://gazetteer.linz.govt.nz/place/32480", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikato_River"}
