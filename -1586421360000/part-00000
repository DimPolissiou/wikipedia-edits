The trio spent two days in orbit testing various new systems on the Soyuz MS spacecraft, before rendezvous and docking with the ISS on 9 July, officially becoming members of the Expedition 48 crew alongside NASA astronaut [[Jeff Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams]] and Roscosmos cosmonauts [[Aleksey Ovchinin]] and [[Oleg Skripochka]]<ref>https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/07/russia-crew-upgraded-soyuz-ms-series/</ref>. \n\n[[File:ISS-48 Welcome of Soyuz MS-01 crew on ISS.jpg|thumb|right| Ivanishin (left) alongside fellow Soyuz crew members shortly after docking to the ISS]]\n\nExpedition 48 officially ended on 6 September 2016 with the departure of Soyuz TMA-20M, following witch Ivanishin took Command of the station for Expedition 49.

They officially joined Roscosmos cosmonaut [[Sergey Volkov (cosmonaut)|Sergey Volkov ]], JAXA astronaut [[Satoshi Furukawa]] and NASA astronaut [[Mike Fossum]] as members of the Expedition 29 crew, the Expedition ended only days later with the departure of [[Soyuz TMA-02M]] on 21 November 2011, carrying Volkov, Furukawa and Fossum back to Earth<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition29/index.html</ref>, following witch Burbank took command of the station for Expedition 30. \n\nThe three were soon joined by Roscosmos cosmonaut [[Oleg Kononenko]], Dutch [[ESA]] astronaut [[Andr\u00e9 Kuipers]] and NASA astronaut [[Donald Pettit]], who launched aboard [[Soyuz TMA-03M]] on 21 December 2011<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_soyuz_tma03m.html</ref>. On 16 February 2012, Ivanishin supported a spacewalk by his fellow cosmonauts, Shaklperov and Kononenko, who performed a six-hour, 15 minutes [[Spacewalk]] from the [[Pirs (ISS module)|Pirs]] airlock module on the Russian segment of the ISS. The two set up several experiments on the outside of the station and moved a [[Strela (crane)|Strela ]] crane from Pirs to the [[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk]] module while Burbank and Ivanishin remained inside Soyuz TMA-22 in case of an emergency<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/spacewalk.html</ref>.\n\nDue to a delay with the launch of the [[Expedition 31]]/[[Expedition 32|32]] crew onboard [[Soyuz TMA-04M]], the landing of Soyuz TMA-22 was delayed from  March to late April 2012<ref>https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=27678.0</ref>. Ivanishin, along with Shakleprov and Burbank landed safely in [[Kazakhstan]] on 27 April, wrapping up Ivanishin's first spaceflight after 165 days in orbit<ref>http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum31/HTML/000333.html</ref>.\n\n=== Expedition 48/49 ===\n[[File:ISS-48 Jeff Williams gets a haircut from Anatoli Ivanishin inside the Destiny lab.jpg|thumb|left| Ivanishin (left) pictured giving Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams a haircut]]\n\nFor his second flight, Ivanishin was assigned to the crew of ISS [[Expedition 48]]/[[Expedition 49|49]], serving as a flight engineer on Expedition 48 and Commander on Expedition 49. Originally this flight was to have launched on [[Soyuz TMA-20M]], the final flight of the [[Soyuz TMA|Soyuz TMA-M]] series of spacecraft, although due to delays with the launch of the first [[Soyuz MS]] series spacecraft, originally scheduled to launch the Expedition 47/48 crew, was pushed back to Expedition 48/49, so Ivanishin's crew instead were assigned to launch aboard [[Soyuz MS-01]]<ref>http://spacepatches.nl/isssoyuz_frame.html</ref>.\n\nIvanishin, alongside [[JAXA]] astronaut [[Takuya Onishi]] and [[NASA]] astronaut [[Kathleen Rubins]] launched into space on board Soyuz MS-01 on 7 July 2016, following a delay from 24 June due to issues with the spacecraft software. The trio spent two days in orbit testing various new systems on the Soyuz MS spacecraft, before rendezvous and docking with the ISS on 9 July, officially becoming members of the Expedition 48 crew alongside NASA astronaut [[Jeff Williams (astronaut)|Jeff Williams]] and Roscosmos cosmonauts [[Aleksey Ovchinin]] and [[Oleg Skripochka]]<ref>https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/07/russia-crew-upgraded-soyuz-ms-series/</ref>. \n\n[[File:ISS-48 Welcome of Soyuz MS-01 crew on ISS.jpg|thumb|right| Ivanishin (left) alongside fellow Soyuz crew members shortly after docking to the ISS]]\n\nExpedition 48 officially ended on 6 September 2016 with the departure of Soyuz TMA-20M, following witch Ivanishin took Command of the station for Expedition 49. They were supposed to be joined by the three crew members on [[Soyuz MS-02]] on 25 September, although due to continuing issues with the introduction of the Soyuz MS spacecraft forced the launch of MS-02 to be delayed due to technical reasons<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/09/17/russians-delay-next-crew-launch-to-space-station/</ref>. Soyuz MS-02 was successfully launched on 19 October 2016, carrying Roscosmos cosmonauts [[Sergey Ryzhikov (cosmonaut)|Sergey Ryzhikov]] and [[Andrei Borisenko]] as well as NASA astronaut [[Shane Kimbrough]] to the station. They arrived on 21 October and joined Ivanishin and his crew<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-02.html</ref>.\n\nFollowing a very short period of six crew operations with the crew of Soyuz MS-02, Ivanishin handed over Command of the station to Kimbrough, following which he returned to Earth with his two crewmates on 29 October 2016 following 115 days in space, bringing up Ivanishin's total time in orbit to 280 days<ref>https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/10/soyuz-ms-01-trio-trip-earth/</ref>.\n\n=== Expedition 62/63 ===\nVagner was assigned to back up to Russian Soyuz Commander [[Nikolai Tikhonov (cosmonaut)|Nikolai Tikhonov]]  onboard [[Soyuz MS-16]], scheduled for launch in April 2020. Although in February 2020 Tikhonov and Russian Flight Engineer [[Andrei Babkin]] removed from the flight due to a temporary health condition with Tikhonov, subsequently Ivanishin and [[Ivan Vagner]] (Babkin's backup) were moved forward onto the prime crew. He is scheduled to launch on 9 April 2020 alongside Vagner and [[NASA]] astronaut [[Chris Cassidy]], he will remain in space until October 2020 as Flight Engineer on Expedition 62 and 63.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Spaceflight}}\n* [[2015 in spaceflight]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat|Anatoli Ivanishin}}\n* [http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/cosmonauts/english/ivanishin_anatoli.htm Spacefacts biography of Anatoli Ivanishin]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-bef|before=[[Jeffrey Williams (astronaut)|Jeffrey Williams]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[Expedition 49|ISS Expedition Commander]] | years=6 September 2016 to 30 October 2016}}\n{{S-aft|after=[[Robert S.
