He was the first MP who was elected Speaker without previously serving as a Deputy Speaker since [[Selwyn Lloyd]] in 1971. Prior to his election as Speaker, he was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP.\n\nHe served as a councillor in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]] from 1986 to 1990 and unsuccessfully contested parliamentary seats in the [[UK general election, 1987|1987]] and [[UK general election, 1992|1992 general elections]], before being elected for Buckingham in 1997. Promoted to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] in 2001, Bercow held posts under [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Michael Howard]]. In November 2002, he resigned over a dispute concerning his support for [[Adoption and Children Act 2002|same-sex adoption]], but returned a year later, only to be dismissed from the Shadow Cabinet in 2004. Having initially been strongly associated with the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction of his party, his views shifted over time; by 2009 there were rumours that he would defect to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], although Bercow denied these.<ref name=\"jbstory\"/>\n\nFollowing the resignation of Speaker [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] in June 2009, Bercow stood in the [[2009 Speaker of the British House of Commons election|election to replace him]] and was successful.

It was established in 2014, after it split from [[Doboj]] municipality. As of 2013, it has a population of 6,958 inhabitants, while the town of Stanari has a population of 1,015 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] in the area of Krnjin and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with a minimum altitude of 138 m (Brestovo) and a maximum altitude of 343 m (Radnja Donja). The municipality of Stanari has three hilly peaks with an altitude of more than 300 m, located on three different sides of the territorial unit of the municipality of Stanari. \n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska on coordinates of eastern longitude 17\u00b049\u203246\u2033 and 44\u00b044\u203250\u2033 north latitude and borders the city of Doboj, and the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Tesli\u0107 and Te\u0161anj. The Municipality of Stanari is one of the smaller municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 160.96 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Stanari makes 0,643% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Stanari belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20130.7 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 30.9 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Stanari is 1.570 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The formation of the Stanari Municipality ===\nThe municipality of Stanari existed and functioned until 1959, when in one of the numerous reorganizations it was abolished and annexed to the municipality of Doboj. The population of this area quickly realized the wrongdoing, because already in 1965 the Municipality, becoming a unit of measure in the planning documents, resolved vital life problems much faster (for example, in 1965 the People's Loan solved the paving of roads at the headquarters of each municipality), and even then launched an activity to rebuild Stanari Municipality.\n\nDue to a lack of understanding, on the one hand, and political obstruction, the initiative for the renewal of the Stanari municipality was not implemented in a few subsequent attempts (1969, 1976 and 1984), and the Initiative Committee for the Restoration of the Municipality of Stanari in 1991 froze the initiative itself, not wanting to question the broader national interests. In 1996, the issue of redevelopment of Stanari Municipality was raised again. At a session held in late December, the will of the residents to become a municipal center was once again confirmed.\n\nAccording to 1996 data, the municipality of Stanari comprised 17 settlements, covering an area of about 213 square kilometers, and according to the census, about 15,000 inhabitants lived in the area. Representatives wishing to break away from Doboj municipality said in the debate that they support the idea of safeguarding the general interest of Serbs in the Doboj area and that they are ready to wait for the right time to establish the municipality, and they also believe that this job is most suitable after the upcoming elections. The members of the Main Board unanimously approved the content of the Request sent to the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, which is to be passed by the Law on the Establishment of the Municipality of Stanari.\n\nResidents got the status of the municipality again in 2014, when the Law on Formation of the Municipality of Stanari was adopted, much to the delight of the residents of this area. The first mayor of the newly formed municipality, elected in February 2015, was Du\u0161an Pani\u0107, of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats.<ref>[http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/69264/Osnovana+op%C5%A1tina+Stanari.html]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 1991 census, all 13 settlements that today make up the municipality of Stanari belonged to Doboj municipality, with 11,238 residents. \n\nIn the 2013 census in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all 13 settlements, of which the municipality of Stanari was formed a year later, were within the City of Doboj, and according to the final data for the Republika Srpska issued by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Srpska, had a population 6,958 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|8,494\n|9,682\n|11,148\n|11,898\n|12,457\n|11,238\n|6,958\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,271\n|1,384\n|1,426\n|1,513\n|1,417\n|1,254\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|896\n|996\n|1,110\n|1,204\n|1,312\n|1,031\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|656\n|749\n|874\n|827\n|843\n|701\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|338\n|394\n|442\n|442\n|506\n|446\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|427\n|476\n|506\n|511\n|491\n|441\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|481\n|555\n|603\n|707\n|730\n|605\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|153\n|377\n|453\n|509\n|510\n|495\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|835\n|763\n|924\n|1,024\n|1,120\n|1,130\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|441\n|498\n|578\n|673\n|710\n|572\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|572\n|592\n|700\n|694\n|714\n|666\n|\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|641\n|777\n|1,141\n|1,224\n|1,301\n|1,299\n|1,015\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|622\n|769\n|915\n|998\n|945\n|897\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,161\n|1,352\n|1,476\n|1,572\n|1,858\n|1,701\n|\n|}\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"6\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|Settlement\n|Serbs\n|Croats\n|Bosniaks\n|Yugoslavs\n|Others\n|-\n|Total\n|9,606 (85.48 %)\n|1,162 (10.34 %)\n|8 (0.07 %)\n|250 (2.22 %)\n|212 (1.89 %)\n|-\n|Brestovo\n|1,192\n|2\n|0\n|13\n|47\n|-\n|Dragalovci\n|32\n|858\n|3\n|86\n|52\n|-\n|Jelanjska\n|682\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|16\n|-\n|Ljeb\n|426\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|11\n|-\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|424\n|1\n|0\n|6\n|10\n|-\n|Osredak\n|408\n|152\n|0\n|42\n|3\n|-\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|491\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|11\n|-\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|1,090\n|3\n|2\n|17\n|18\n|-\n|Radnja Donja\n|557\n|0\n|0\n|11\n|4\n|-\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|530\n|117\n|1\n|10\n|8\n|-\n|'''Stanari'''\n|1,204\n|20\n|1\n|45\n|29\n|-\n|Cvrtkovci\n|888\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|-\n|Cerovica\n|1,682\n|6\n|1\n|6\n|6\n|}\n== Tourism ==\n\n=== Nature ===\n'''Cerovi\u010dka Cave''', the cave in Cerovica, also called the Vukovi\u0107 cave among the locals, is a cave located on one of the long hill lines that follows the terrain from east to west. The entrance to the cave was until the 1992-1995 war mostly buried, but the entrance was dug up for the purpose of hiding the population and the army. The cave consists of an entrance hall, which is partly covered with broken stones from the ceiling, while the other part is under cave sediments, mostly composed of clayey soil and small rocks formed by the calcification process. The cave is wet throughout its entire surface due to dripping of water from the ceilings and a temperature that never exceeds 15 \u00b0C.\n\n'''Rivers and streams''', the largest river that flows through the territory of the municipality of Stanari is Ukrina. Beside it, the water network is also composed of the rivers Ilova, Radnja and Ostru\u017enja and numerous streams, which all have places suitable for picnics and camping in pristine nature next to old watermills, cold drinking springs, grasslands and forests. Along the streams of the Ukrina, Ostru\u017enja, Radnja can be found remains of abandoned watermills, of which only two on the river Radnja are functioning.The river Ukrina is especially interesting because it is largest rivers whose source and mouth are in the territory of Republika Srpska. Another curiosity related to this river is a special phenomenon when in mid-August, around the Transfiguration of the Lord, the river Ukrina \"blossoms.\" This phenomenon lasts for several days, and it involves the covering of the river surface by whitish membranes, that are released by the immature male insects ''Palingenia longicauda,'' which remain on the surface of the water and create an image of water covered with petals flowers.\n\n=== Archaeological Findings ===\n'''Gradina (Brestovo) fortress,''' a medieval fortress on a steep low rock above the right bank of the river Ukrina. This horseshoe-shaped structure is about 23m in length and 13m in width. It consists of a round tower and a square enclosure. The outer walls are 2 m thick. Inside the building is a preserved cultural layer rich in fragments of earthen vessels that can be, at least in the upper layer, dated back to the 15th century.\n\n'''Ste\u0107ci,''' in the area of Stanari there are many sites with ste\u0107aks dating back to the Middle Ages, the most famous of which are the Greek cemeteries in Brestovo and Osredak. In addition to this, the sites from the prehistory which stand out are: Gypsy village in Brestovo, a prehistoric settlement above the Ukrine valley, where there were found remains of pottery from the Late Bronze or Iron Age, and the Mati\u0107a Head, a Paleolithic station in Dragalovci.\n\n=== Museum \"Gojakovac\" Cerovica ===\nThe Local Museum in Cerovica was founded by the Cerovica Parish led by priest Miroslav \u017divkovi\u0107. Through years of effort, collecting material traces of cultural heritage of Cerovic region, and help and support from locals and expert associates, a permanent exhibition was made in the museum on May 2014.

It was established in 2014, after it split from [[Doboj]] municipality. As of 2013, it has a population of 6,958 inhabitants, while the town of Stanari has a population of 1,015 inhabitants.\n\n==Geography==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] in the area of Krnjin and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with a minimum altitude of 138 m (Brestovo) and a maximum altitude of 343 m (Radnja Donja). The municipality of Stanari has three hilly peaks with an altitude of more than 300 m, located on three different sides of the territorial unit of the municipality of Stanari. \n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Stanari municipality is located in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska on coordinates of eastern longitude 17\u00b049\u203246\u2033 and 44\u00b044\u203250\u2033 north latitude and borders the city of Doboj, and the municipalities of Derventa, Prnjavor, Tesli\u0107 and Te\u0161anj. The Municipality of Stanari is one of the smaller municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 160.96 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Stanari makes 0,643% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Stanari belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20130.7 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 30.9 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Stanari is 1.570 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The formation of the Stanari Municipality ===\nThe municipality of Stanari existed and functioned until 1959, when in one of the numerous reorganizations it was abolished and annexed to the municipality of Doboj. The population of this area quickly realized the wrongdoing, because already in 1965 the Municipality, becoming a unit of measure in the planning documents, resolved vital life problems much faster (for example, in 1965 the People's Loan solved the paving of roads at the headquarters of each municipality), and even then launched an activity to rebuild Stanari Municipality.\n\nDue to a lack of understanding, on the one hand, and political obstruction, the initiative for the renewal of the Stanari municipality was not implemented in a few subsequent attempts (1969, 1976 and 1984), and the Initiative Committee for the Restoration of the Municipality of Stanari in 1991 froze the initiative itself, not wanting to question the broader national interests. In 1996, the issue of redevelopment of Stanari Municipality was raised again. At a session held in late December, the will of the residents to become a municipal center was once again confirmed.\n\nAccording to 1996 data, the municipality of Stanari comprised 17 settlements, covering an area of about 213 square kilometers, and according to the census, about 15,000 inhabitants lived in the area. Representatives wishing to break away from Doboj municipality said in the debate that they support the idea of safeguarding the general interest of Serbs in the Doboj area and that they are ready to wait for the right time to establish the municipality, and they also believe that this job is most suitable after the upcoming elections. The members of the Main Board unanimously approved the content of the Request sent to the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, which is to be passed by the Law on the Establishment of the Municipality of Stanari.\n\nResidents got the status of the municipality again in 2014, when the Law on Formation of the Municipality of Stanari was adopted, much to the delight of the residents of this area. The first mayor of the newly formed municipality, elected in February 2015, was Du\u0161an Pani\u0107, of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats.<ref>[http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/69264/Osnovana+op%C5%A1tina+Stanari.html]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 1991 census, all 13 settlements that today make up the municipality of Stanari belonged to Doboj municipality, with 11,238 residents. \n\nIn the 2013 census in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all 13 settlements, of which the municipality of Stanari was formed a year later, were within the City of Doboj, and according to the final data for the Republika Srpska issued by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Srpska, had a population 6,958 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|8,494\n|9,682\n|11,148\n|11,898\n|12,457\n|11,238\n|6,958\n|-\n|1\n|Brestovo\n|1,271\n|1,384\n|1,426\n|1,513\n|1,417\n|1,254\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Dragalovci\n|896\n|996\n|1,110\n|1,204\n|1,312\n|1,031\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Jelanjska\n|656\n|749\n|874\n|827\n|843\n|701\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Ljeb\n|338\n|394\n|442\n|442\n|506\n|446\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|427\n|476\n|506\n|511\n|491\n|441\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Osredak\n|481\n|555\n|603\n|707\n|730\n|605\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|153\n|377\n|453\n|509\n|510\n|495\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|835\n|763\n|924\n|1,024\n|1,120\n|1,130\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Radnja Donja\n|441\n|498\n|578\n|673\n|710\n|572\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|572\n|592\n|700\n|694\n|714\n|666\n|\n|-\n|11\n|'''Stanari'''\n|641\n|777\n|1,141\n|1,224\n|1,301\n|1,299\n|1,015\n|-\n|12\n|Cvrtkovci\n|622\n|769\n|915\n|998\n|945\n|897\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Cerovica\n|1,161\n|1,352\n|1,476\n|1,572\n|1,858\n|1,701\n|\n|}\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"6\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Stanari municipality\n|-\n|Settlement\n|Serbs\n|Croats\n|Bosniaks\n|Yugoslavs\n|Others\n|-\n|Total\n|9,606 (85.48 %)\n|1,162 (10.34 %)\n|8 (0.07 %)\n|250 (2.22 %)\n|212 (1.89 %)\n|-\n|Brestovo\n|1,192\n|2\n|0\n|13\n|47\n|-\n|Dragalovci\n|32\n|858\n|3\n|86\n|52\n|-\n|Jelanjska\n|682\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|16\n|-\n|Ljeb\n|426\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|11\n|-\n|Mitrovi\u0107i\n|424\n|1\n|0\n|6\n|10\n|-\n|Osredak\n|408\n|152\n|0\n|42\n|3\n|-\n|Ostru\u017enja Gornja\n|491\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|11\n|-\n|Ostru\u017enja Donja\n|1,090\n|3\n|2\n|17\n|18\n|-\n|Radnja Donja\n|557\n|0\n|0\n|11\n|4\n|-\n|Ra\u0161kovci\n|530\n|117\n|1\n|10\n|8\n|-\n|'''Stanari'''\n|1,204\n|20\n|1\n|45\n|29\n|-\n|Cvrtkovci\n|888\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|-\n|Cerovica\n|1,682\n|6\n|1\n|6\n|6\n|}\n== Tourism ==\n\n=== Nature ===\n'''Cerovi\u010dka Cave''', the cave in Cerovica, also called the Vukovi\u0107 cave among the locals, is a cave located on one of the long hill lines that follows the terrain from east to west. The entrance to the cave was until the 1992-1995 war mostly buried, but the entrance was dug up for the purpose of hiding the population and the army. The cave consists of an entrance hall, which is partly covered with broken stones from the ceiling, while the other part is under cave sediments, mostly composed of clayey soil and small rocks formed by the calcification process. The cave is wet throughout its entire surface due to dripping of water from the ceilings and a temperature that never exceeds 15 \u00b0C.\n\n'''Rivers and streams''', the largest river that flows through the territory of the municipality of Stanari is Ukrina. Beside it, the water network is also composed of the rivers Ilova, Radnja and Ostru\u017enja and numerous streams, which all have places suitable for picnics and camping in pristine nature next to old watermills, cold drinking springs, grasslands and forests. Along the streams of the Ukrina, Ostru\u017enja, Radnja can be found remains of abandoned watermills, of which only two on the river Radnja are functioning.The river Ukrina is especially interesting because it is largest rivers whose source and mouth are in the territory of Republika Srpska. Another curiosity related to this river is a special phenomenon when in mid-August, around the Transfiguration of the Lord, the river Ukrina \"blossoms.\" This phenomenon lasts for several days, and it involves the covering of the river surface by whitish membranes, that are released by the immature male insects ''Palingenia longicauda,'' which remain on the surface of the water and create an image of water covered with petals flowers.\n\n=== Archaeological Findings ===\n'''Gradina (Brestovo) fortress,''' a medieval fortress on a steep low rock above the right bank of the river Ukrina. This horseshoe-shaped structure is about 23m in length and 13m in width. It consists of a round tower and a square enclosure. The outer walls are 2 m thick. Inside the building is a preserved cultural layer rich in fragments of earthen vessels that can be, at least in the upper layer, dated back to the 15th century.\n\n'''Ste\u0107ci,''' in the area of Stanari there are many sites with ste\u0107aks dating back to the Middle Ages, the most famous of which are the Greek cemeteries in Brestovo and Osredak. In addition to this, the sites from the prehistory which stand out are: Gypsy village in Brestovo, a prehistoric settlement above the Ukrine valley, where there were found remains of pottery from the Late Bronze or Iron Age, and the Mati\u0107a Head, a Paleolithic station in Dragalovci.\n\n=== Museum \"Gojakovac\" Cerovica ===\nThe Local Museum in Cerovica was founded by the Cerovica Parish led by priest Miroslav \u017divkovi\u0107. Through years of effort, collecting material traces of cultural heritage of Cerovic region, and help and support from locals and expert associates, a permanent exhibition was made in the museum on May 2014. The exhibition of the museum contains: archeological, ethnological, historical and library collections.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=1 January 2020 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing [[Highland Clearances]], in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain.

Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions.

From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.\n\nThe [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]].\n\n[[File:The Cuillins on a still morning (9878281443).jpg|thumb|The [[Scottish Highlands]], located in the north west of Scotland|alt=|left]]\n\nA significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low-lying dune pasture land.\n\nThe [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.\n\nThe [[Southern Uplands]] are a range of hills almost {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |title=Southern Uplands |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date=16 November 1990 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128062644/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |archivedate=28 November 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |title=Education Scotland \u2013 Standard Grade Bitesize Revision \u2013 Ask a Teacher \u2013 Geography \u2013 Physical \u2013 Question From PN |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Scotland Today \u00bb ITKT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |title=Scotland Today \" ITKT |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com |date=28 December 2006 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106204251/http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archivedate = 6 January 2007}}</ref> The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 400\u2013500&nbsp;million years ago.

These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing [[Highland Clearances]], in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the [[Highland Potato Famine]] and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.<ref>E.

Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions.

From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.\n\nThe [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]].\n\n[[File:The Cuillins on a still morning (9878281443).jpg|thumb|The [[Scottish Highlands]], located in the north west of Scotland|alt=|left]]\n\nA significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low-lying dune pasture land.\n\nThe [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.\n\nThe [[Southern Uplands]] are a range of hills almost {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |title=Southern Uplands |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date=16 November 1990 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128062644/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |archivedate=28 November 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |title=Education Scotland \u2013 Standard Grade Bitesize Revision \u2013 Ask a Teacher \u2013 Geography \u2013 Physical \u2013 Question From PN |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Scotland Today \u00bb ITKT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |title=Scotland Today \" ITKT |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com |date=28 December 2006 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106204251/http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archivedate = 6 January 2007}}</ref> The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 400\u2013500&nbsp;million years ago.

It was released on October 3, 2008 by [[Jive Records]] as the [[lead single]] of the album. Produced and written by [[The Outsyders]], the song was re-recorded after a snippet was leaked onto the internet. \"Womanizer\" is an up-tempo [[electropop]] and [[dance-pop]] song. Described by Spears as a girl [[anthem]], the song's lyrics recall a womanizing man, while the protagonist of the song makes clear she knows who he really is. Music critics mostly praised its hook, melody and empowering lyrics. Critics also observed it was a stand-out track from its album and also deemed it as a comeback single for Spears.\n\n\"Womanizer\" was a commercial success worldwide, peaking atop of the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Sweden and the United States. It also reached the top ten in every country it charted in also receiving several certifications from several countries. In the United States, \"Womanizer\" was her first single to reach number-one since \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" in 1999. The song broke the record for the highest jump to number one at a time which was later broken by [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" in 2009. It is also her best-selling digital song in the country, having sold over 3.5 million copies.<ref name=us_sales>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6509510/ask-billboard-britney-spearss-career-sales|title=Ask Billboard: Britney Spears's Career Sales|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref> The song received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards | 52nd Grammy Awards]], becoming her second nomination in the category.\n\nThe music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], was created by Spears as a sequel to the music video of \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\". It portrays Spears as a woman who disguises herself in different costumes and follows her boyfriend through his daily activities to expose him in the end. The video also contains interspersed scenes of Spears naked in a steam room, as a response to the attacks she had received over the years about her weight. The video was also nominated for two categories at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], and went on to win [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]].\n\nThe song has been covered by a number of artists from different genres, including [[Lily Allen]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[Girls Aloud]]. Spears performed \"Womanizer\" on several television shows including ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', as well as award shows such as the [[Bambi Awards|2008 Bambi Awards]]. She has also performed the song at [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] (2009), the [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011) and [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2013).\n\n==Background==\nThe song was written and co-produced by Nikesha Briscoe and Rafael Akinyemi of the production team, [[The Outsyders]].

During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while covering herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend ([[:es:Brandon Stoughton|Brandon Stoughton]]) as he gets ready for work. When he is at the office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing [[horn-rimmed glasses]] and a [[pencil skirt]]. She starts dancing in front of him and sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\". Then, Spears is disguised as a black-haired, tattooed [[waitress]] in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a [[chauffeur]]. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was \"womanizing\" all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.<ref name=premiere/>\n\n===Reception===\nMargeaux Watson of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the video \"looks promising.

It was released on October 3, 2008 by [[Jive Records]] as the [[lead single]] of the album. Produced and written by [[The Outsyders]], the song was re-recorded after a snippet was leaked onto the internet. \"Womanizer\" is an up-tempo [[electropop]] and [[dance-pop]] song. Described by Spears as a girl [[anthem]], the song's lyrics recall a womanizing man, while the protagonist of the song makes clear she knows who he really is. Music critics mostly praised its hook, melody and empowering lyrics. Critics also observed it was a stand-out track from its album and also deemed it as a comeback single for Spears.\n\n\"Womanizer\" was a commercial success worldwide, peaking atop of the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Sweden and the United States. It also reached the top ten in every country it charted in also receiving several certifications from several countries. In the United States, \"Womanizer\" was her first single to reach number-one since \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" in 1999. The song broke the record for the highest jump to number one at a time which was later broken by [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" in 2009. It is also her best-selling digital song in the country, having sold over 3.5 million copies.<ref name=us_sales>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6509510/ask-billboard-britney-spearss-career-sales|title=Ask Billboard: Britney Spears's Career Sales|work=Billboard|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}</ref> The song received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards | 52nd Grammy Awards]], becoming her second nomination in the category.\n\nThe music video, directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], was created by Spears as a sequel to the music video of \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\". It portrays Spears as a woman who disguises herself in different costumes and follows her boyfriend through his daily activities to expose him in the end. The video also contains interspersed scenes of Spears naked in a steam room, as a response to the attacks she had received over the years about her weight. The video was also nominated for two categories at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], and went on to win [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]].\n\nThe song has been covered by a number of artists from different genres, including [[Lily Allen]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[Girls Aloud]]. Spears performed \"Womanizer\" on several television shows including ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', as well as award shows such as the [[Bambi Awards|2008 Bambi Awards]]. She has also performed the song at [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] (2009), the [[Femme Fatale Tour]] (2011) and [[Britney: Piece of Me]] (2013).\n\n==Background==\nThe song was written and co-produced by Nikesha Briscoe and Rafael Akinyemi of the production team, [[The Outsyders]]. Spears recorded main vocals with Brendan Dakora at Glenwood Place Studios in [[Burbank, California]] and Bojan \"Genius\" Dugic at Legacy Studios in New York City.

During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while covering herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend ([[:es:Brandon Stoughton|Brandon Stoughton]]) as he gets ready for work. When he is at the office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing [[horn-rimmed glasses]] and a [[pencil skirt]]. She starts dancing in front of him and sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on \"[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]\". Then, Spears is disguised as a black-haired, tattooed [[waitress]] in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a [[chauffeur]]. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was \"womanizing\" all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed.

The method was developed by [[Richard Bellman]] in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from [[aerospace engineering]] to [[economics]]. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a [[Recursion|recursive]] manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have [[optimal substructure]].\n\nIf sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.<ref name=\":0\">Cormen, T. H.; Leiserson, C. E.; Rivest, R. L.; Stein, C. (2001), Introduction to Algorithms (2nd ed.), MIT Press & McGraw\u2013Hill, {{ISBN|0-262-03293-7}} . pp. 344.</ref> In the optimization literature this relationship is called the [[Bellman equation]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\n=== Mathematical optimization ===\nIn terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of '''value functions''' ''V''<sub>1</sub>, ''V''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''V''<sub>''n''</sub> taking ''y'' as an argument representing the '''[[State variable|state]]''' of the system at times ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. The definition of ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''y'') is the value obtained in state ''y'' at the last time ''n''. The values ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at earlier times ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;1,&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1 can be found by working backwards, using a [[Recursion|recursive]] relationship called the [[Bellman equation]]. For ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n'', ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> at any state ''y'' is calculated from ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time ''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 and the function ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> for those states. Finally, ''V''<sub>1</sub> at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.\n\n=== Control theory ===\nIn [[control theory]], a typical problem is to find an admissible control <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}</math> which causes the system <math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right)</math> to follow an admissible trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> on a continuous time interval <math>t_{0} \\leq t \\leq t_{1}</math> that minimizes a [[Loss function|cost function]]\n:<math>J = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\mathrm{d} t</math> \nThe solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} = h(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)</math>, which produces an optimal trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> and an optimized loss function <math>J^{\\ast}</math>. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming:\n:<math>- J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\min_{\\mathbf{u}} \\left\\{ f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) + J_{x}^{\\ast \\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\right\\}</math>\na [[partial differential equation]] known as the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]], in which <math>J_{x}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{1}} ~~~~ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{2}} ~~~~ \\dots ~~~~  \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{n}} \\right]^{\\mathsf{T}}</math> and <math>J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial t}</math>.

In Ramsey's problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of [[utility]]. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in [[Physical capital|capital stock]] that is used in production), known as [[intertemporal choice]]. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate <math>\\beta \\in (0,1)</math>. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by\n:<math>k_{t+1} = \\hat{g} \\left( k_{t}, c_{t} \\right) = f(k_{t}) - c_{t}</math>\nwhere <math>c</math> is consumption, <math>k</math> is capital, and <math>f</math> is a [[production function]] satisfying the [[Inada conditions]]. An initial capital stock <math>k_{0} > 0</math> is assumed.\n\nLet <math>c_t</math> be consumption in period {{mvar|t}}, and assume consumption yields [[utility]] <math>u(c_t)=\\ln(c_t)</math> as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he [[discounting|discounts]] future utility by a factor {{mvar|b}} each period, where <math>0<b<1</math>. Let <math>k_t</math> be [[capital (economics)|capital]] in period {{mvar|t}}. Assume initial capital is a given amount <math>k_0>0</math>, and suppose that this period's capital and consumption determine next period's capital as <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t</math>, where {{mvar|A}} is a positive constant and <math>0<a<1</math>. Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer's decision problem can be written as follows:\n\n: <math>\\max \\sum_{t=0}^T b^t \\ln(c_t)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math> for all <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>\n\nWritten this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables <math>c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots , c_T</math>. (The capital <math>k_0</math> is not a choice variable\u2014the consumer's initial capital is taken as given.)\n\nThe dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of ''value functions'' <math>V_t(k)</math>, for <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T,T+1</math> which represent the value of having any amount of capital {{mvar|k}} at each time {{mvar|t}}. There is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death, <math>V_{T+1}(k)=0</math>.\n\nThe value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by [[backward induction]] using the [[Bellman equation]]. In this problem, for each <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>, the Bellman equation is\n\n: <math>V_t(k_t) \\, = \\, \\max \\left( \\ln(c_t) + b V_{t+1}(k_{t+1}) \\right)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math>\n\nThis problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, <math>c_t</math> and <math>k_{t+1}</math>. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time {{mvar|t}}, his current capital <math>k_t</math> is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption <math>c_t</math> and saving <math>k_{t+1}</math>.\n\nTo actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as {{mvar|k}}. <math>V_{T+1}(k)</math> is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate <math>V_T(k)</math>, and so on until we get to <math>V_0(k)</math>, which is the ''value'' of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know <math>V_{T-j+1}(k)</math>, we can calculate <math>V_{T-j}(k)</math>, which is the maximum of <math>\\ln(c_{T-j}) + b V_{T-j+1}(Ak^a-c_{T-j})</math>, where <math>c_{T-j}</math> is the choice variable and <math>Ak^a-c_{T-j} \\ge 0</math>.\n\nWorking backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>V_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, a \\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i \\ln k + v_{T-j}</math>\n\nwhere each <math>v_{T-j}</math> is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>c_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i} Ak^a</math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nc_{T}(k) & = Ak^a\\\\\nc_{T-1}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab}\\\\\nc_{T-2}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2}\\\\\n&\\dots\\\\\nc_2(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}}\\\\\nc_1(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}}\\\\\nc_0(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}+a^Tb^T}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period {{mvar|T}}, the last period of life.\n\n=== Computer programming ===\nThere are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: [[optimal substructure]] and [[overlapping subproblem|overlapping sub-problem]]s. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to ''non-overlapping'' sub-problems, the strategy is called \"[[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]\" instead.<ref name=\":0\" />  This is why [[mergesort|merge sort]] and [[quicksort|quick sort]] are not classified as dynamic programming problems.\n\n''Optimal substructure'' means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of [[recursion]]. For example, given a graph ''G=(V,E)'', the shortest path ''p'' from a vertex ''u'' to a vertex ''v'' exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex ''w'' on this shortest path ''p''. If ''p'' is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths ''p<sub>1</sub>'' from ''u'' to ''w'' and ''p<sub>2</sub>'' from ''w'' to ''v'' such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]''). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]] or the [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm]] does.\n\n''Overlapping'' sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> + ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;2</sub>, with base case ''F''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. Then ''F''<sub>43</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>42</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>, and ''F''<sub>42</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>40</sub>. Now ''F''<sub>41</sub> is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both ''F''<sub>43</sub> as well as ''F''<sub>42</sub>. Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.\n\n[[Image:Fibonacci dynamic programming.svg|thumb|108px|'''Figure 2.''' The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. The fact that it is not a [[tree structure|tree]] indicates overlapping subproblems.]]\n\nThis can be achieved in either of two ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Top-down approach]]'': This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily [[memoize]] or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Bottom-up approach]]'': Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of ''F''<sub>41</sub> and ''F''<sub>40</sub>, we can directly calculate the value of ''F''<sub>42</sub>.\n\nSome [[programming language]]s can automatically [[memoization|memoize]] the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up [[call-by-name]] evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as ''[[call-by-need]]''). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Perl]] or [[D (programming language)|D]]). Some languages have automatic [[memoization]] <!-- still not a typo for \"memor-\" --> built in, such as tabled [[Prolog]] and [[J (programming language)|J]], which supports memoization with the ''M.'' adverb.<ref>{{cite web|title=M. Memo|url=http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dmcapdot.htm|work=J Vocabulary|publisher=J Software|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> In any case, this is only possible for a [[referentially transparent]] function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as [[Wolfram Language]].\n\n=== Bioinformatics ===\nDynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for the tasks such as [[sequence alignment]], [[protein folding]], RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by [[Charles DeLisi]] in USA<ref>DeLisi, Biopolymers, 1974, Volume 13, Issue 7, pages 1511\u20131512, July 1974</ref> and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR.<ref>Gurski\u012d GV, Zasedatelev AS, Biofizika, 1978 Sep-Oct;23(5):932-46</ref> Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of [[nucleosome]] positioning and [[transcription factor]] binding.\n\n== Examples: Computer algorithms ==\n\n=== Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem ===\nFrom a dynamic programming point of view, [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for the [[shortest path problem]]  is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the '''Reaching''' method.<ref name=sniedovich_06>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dijkstra's algorithm revisited: the dynamic programming connexion | journal = Journal of Control and Cybernetics | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 599\u2013620 | year = 2006 | url = http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/cc/cc35/cc3536.pdf | postscript = .}} [http://www.ifors.ms.unimelb.edu.au/tutorial/dijkstra_new/index.html Online version of the paper with interactive computational modules.]</ref><ref name=denardo_03>{{Citation | last = Denardo | first = E.V. | title = Dynamic Programming: Models and Applications | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | location = Mineola, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-486-42810-9}}</ref><ref name=sniedovich_10>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4099-3  }}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Dijkstra's explanation of the logic behind the algorithm,<ref>{{harvnb|Dijkstra|1959|p=270}}</ref> namely\n{{quote|\n'''Problem 2.'''

Here is a na\u00efve implementation, based directly on the mathematical definition:\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n <= 1 '''return''' n\n        '''return''' fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n\nNotice that if we call, say, <code>fib(5)</code>, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:\n\n# <code>fib(5)</code>\n# <code>fib(4) + fib(3)</code>\n# <code>(fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>((fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>(((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n\nIn particular, <code>fib(2)</code> was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of <code>fib</code>, or ''subproblems'', are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.\n\nNow, suppose we have a simple [[Associative array|map]] object, ''m'', which maps each value of <code>fib</code> that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') time instead of exponential time (but requires [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') space):\n\n    '''var''' m := '''''map'''''(0 \u2192 0, 1 \u2192 1)\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if ''key''''' n '''is not in ''map''''' m \n            m[n] := fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n        '''return''' m[n]\n\nThis technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called ''[[memoization]]''; <!-- Yes, memoization, not memorization. Not a typo. --> this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.\n\nIn the '''bottom-up''' approach, we calculate the smaller values of <code>fib</code> first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(''n'') time since it contains a loop that repeats n \u2212 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(''n'') space to store the map.\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n = 0\n            '''return''' 0\n        '''else'''\n            '''var''' previousFib := 0, currentFib := 1\n            '''repeat''' n \u2212 1 '''times''' ''// loop is skipped if n = 1''\n                '''var''' newFib := previousFib + currentFib\n                previousFib := currentFib\n                currentFib  := newFib\n        '''return''' currentFib\n\nIn both examples, we only calculate <code>fib(2)</code> one time, and then use it to calculate both <code>fib(4)</code> and <code>fib(3)</code>, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.\n\nThe above method actually takes <math>\\Omega(n^2)</math> time for large n because addition of two integers with <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits each takes <math>\\Omega(n)</math> time. (The ''n''<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number has <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits.) Also, there is a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence, [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet#Binet's Fibonacci number formula|known as Binet's formula]], from which the <math>n</math>-th term can be [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations|computed]] in approximately <math>O(n(\\log n)^2)</math> time, which is more efficient than the above dynamic programming technique. However, the simple recurrence directly gives [[Fibonacci sequence#Matrix form|the matrix form]] that leads to an approximately <math>O(n\\log n)</math> algorithm by fast [[matrix exponentiation]].\n\n=== A type of balanced 0\u20131 matrix ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an {{math|<var>n</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} matrix, with {{math|<var>n</var>}} even, so that each row and each column contains exactly {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given <math>n</math>. For example, when {{math|<var>n</var> {{=}} 4}}, four possible solutions are\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThere are at least three possible approaches: [[Brute-force search|brute force]], [[backtracking]], and dynamic programming.\n\nBrute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns ({{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones). As there are <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}^n</math> possible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to <math>n=6</math>.\n\nBacktracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}}. While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for {{math|<var>n</var>}} larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for {{math|<var>n</var>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;8, as we shall see.\n\nDynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row \u2013 what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} boards, where {{math|1 &le; <var>k</var> &le; <var>n</var>}}, whose <math>k</math> rows contain <math>n/2</math> zeros and <math>n/2</math> ones. The function ''f'' to which [[memoization]] is applied maps vectors of ''n'' pairs of integers to the number of admissible boards (solutions). There is one pair for each column, and its two components indicate respectively the number of zeros and ones that have yet to be placed in that column. We seek the value of <math> f((n/2, n/2), (n/2, n/2), \\ldots (n/2, n/2)) </math> (<math>n</math> arguments or one vector of <math>n</math> elements). The process of subproblem creation involves iterating over every one of  <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}</math> possible assignments for the top row of the board, and going through every column, subtracting one from the appropriate element of the pair for that column, depending on whether the assignment for the top row contained a zero or a one at that position. If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining {{math|(<var>k</var> &minus; 1) &times; <var>n</var>}} board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized. The base case is the trivial subproblem, which occurs for a {{math|1 &times; <var>n</var>}} board. The number of solutions for this board is either zero or one, depending on whether the vector is a permutation of {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(0, 1)</math> and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(1, 0)</math> pairs or not.\n\nFor example, in the first two boards shown above the sequences of vectors would be\n<PRE WIDTH=80>\n((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))       ((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))     k = 4\n  0      1      0      1              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 2) (2, 1) (1, 2) (2, 1))       ((1, 2) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 1))     k = 3\n  1      0      1      0              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1))       ((0, 2) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 0))     k = 2\n  0      1      0      1              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 1) (1, 0) (0, 1) (1, 0))       ((0, 1) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 0))     k = 1\n  1      0      1      0              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0))       ((0, 0) (0, 0), (0, 0) (0, 0))\n</PRE>\n\nThe number of solutions {{OEIS|id=A058527}} is\n\n:<math> 1,\\, 2,\\,  90,\\, 297200,\\, 116963796250,\\, 6736218287430460752, \\ldots </math>\n\nLinks to the MAPLE implementation of the dynamic programming approach may be found among the [[Dynamic programming#External links|external links]].\n\n=== Checkerboard ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider a [[checkerboard]] with ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' squares and a cost function <code>c(i, j)</code> which returns a cost associated with square <code>(i,j)</code> (<code>''i''</code> being the row, <code>''j''</code> being the column). For instance (on a 5 \u00d7 5 checkerboard),\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n| 6 || 7 || 4 || 7 || 8\n|-\n! 4\n| 7 || 6 || 1 || 1 || 4\n|-\n! 3\n| 3 || 5 || 7 || 8 || 2\n|-\n! 2\n| \u2013 || 6 || 7 || 0 || \u2013\n|-\n! 1\n| \u2013 || \u2013 || *5* || \u2013 || \u2013\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\nThus <code>c(1, 3) = 5</code>\n\nLet us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (the sum of the minimum costs at each visited rank) to get to the last rank; assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on <code>(1,3)</code> can move to <code>(2,2)</code>, <code>(2,3)</code> or <code>(2,4)</code>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  || x  || x || x ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  || o ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\nThis problem exhibits '''optimal substructure'''. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function <code>q(i, j)</code> as\n\n:''q''(''i'', ''j'') = the minimum cost to reach square (''i'', ''j'').\n\nStarting at rank <code>n</code> and descending to rank <code>1</code>, we compute the value of this function for all the squares at each successive rank. Picking the square that holds the minimum value at each rank gives us the shortest path between rank <code>n</code> and rank <code>1</code>.\n\nThe function <code>q(i, j)</code> is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus <code>c(i, j)</code>. For instance:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  || A  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  || B || C || D ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\n: <math>q(A) = \\min(q(B),q(C),q(D))+c(A) \\, </math>\n\nNow, let us define <code>q(i, j)</code> in somewhat more general terms:\n\n: <math>q(i,j)=\\begin{cases} \\infty & j < 1 \\text{ or }j > n \\\\ c(i, j) & i = 1 \\\\ \\min(q(i-1, j-1), q(i-1, j), q(i-1, j+1)) + c(i,j) & \\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe first line of this equation deals with a board modeled as squares indexed on <code>1</code> at the lowest bound and <code>n</code> at the highest bound. The second line specifies what happens at the last rank; providing a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It represents the <code>A,B,C,D</code> terms in the example. From this definition we can derive straightforward recursive code for <code>q(i,\u00a0j)</code>. In the following pseudocode, <code>n</code> is the size of the board, <code>c(i, j)</code> is the cost function, and <code>min()</code> returns the minimum of a number of values:\n\n '''function''' minCost(i, j)\n     '''if''' j &lt; 1 '''or''' j > n\n         '''return''' infinity\n     '''else if''' i = 1\n         '''return''' c(i, j)\n     '''else'''\n         '''return''' '''min'''( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)\n\nThis function only computes the path cost, not the actual path. We discuss the actual path below. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow because it too exhibits the '''overlapping sub-problems''' attribute. That is, it recomputes the same path costs over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path costs in a two-dimensional array <code>q[i, j]</code> rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; all the values needed for array <code>q[i, j]</code> are computed ahead of time only once. Precomputed values for <code>(i,j)</code> are simply looked-up whenever needed.\n\nWe also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array <code>p[i, j]</code>; a ''predecessor array''. This array records the path to any square <code>s</code>. The predecessor of <code>s</code> is modeled as an offset relative to the index (in <code>q[i, j]</code>) of the precomputed path cost of <code>s</code>. To reconstruct the complete path, we lookup the predecessor of <code>s</code>, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on recursively, until we reach the starting square.

Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the [[edit distance|sequence of edits with the lowest total cost]].\n\nThe problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:\n\n# inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B\n# deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B\n# replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.\n\nThe partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j].  The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.\n\nDifferent variants exist, see [[Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm]] and [[Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm]].\n\n=== Tower of Hanoi puzzle ===\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|A model set of the Towers of Hanoi (with 8 disks)]]\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|300px|thumb|An animated solution of the '''Tower of Hanoi''' puzzle for ''T(4,3)''.]]\nThe '''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' or '''Towers of [[Hanoi]]''' is a [[mathematical game]] or [[puzzle]]. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:\n\n* Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.\n* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe dynamic programming solution consists of solving the [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]\n\n: S(n,h,t) = S(n-1,h, not(h,t)) ; S(1,h,t) ; S(n-1,not(h,t),t)\n\nwhere n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), \";\" denotes concatenation, and\n\n: S(n, h, t) := solution to a problem consisting of n disks that are to be moved from rod h to rod t.\n\nFor n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = \"move a disk from rod h to rod t\" (there is only one disk left).\n\nThe  number of moves required by this solution is 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. If the objective is to '''maximize''' the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]  is slightly more complicated and  3<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 moves are required.<ref>{{Citation |author=Moshe Sniedovich |title= OR/MS Games: 2.

We make a few assumptions:\n\n:* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.\n:* A broken egg must be discarded.\n:* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.\n:* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.\n:* If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.\n:* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.\n\n: If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the lowest number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?\n\nTo derive a dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]] for this puzzle, let the '''state''' of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where\n\n: ''n'' = number of test eggs available, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., ''N''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n: ''k'' = number of (consecutive) floors yet to be tested, ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''H''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\nFor instance, ''s'' = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is ''s'' = (''N'',''H'') where ''N'' denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (''n'' = 0) or when ''k'' = 0, whichever occurs first. If termination occurs at state ''s'' = (0,''k'') and ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, then the test failed.\n\nNow, let\n\n: ''W''(''n'',''k'') = minimum number of trials required to identify the value of the critical floor under the worst-case scenario given that the process is in state ''s'' = (''n'',''k'').\n\nThen it can be shown that<ref name=\"sniedovich_03\">Sniedovich, M.

This can be improved to <math>O( n k \\log k )</math> time by binary searching on the optimal <math>x</math> in the above recurrence, since <math>W(n-1,x-1)</math> is increasing in <math>x</math> while <math>W(n,k-x)</math> is decreasing in <math>x</math>, thus a local minimum of <math>\\max(W(n-1,x-1),W(n,k-x))</math> is a global minimum. Also, by storing the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell in the DP table and referring to its value for the previous cell, the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell can be found in constant time, improving it to <math>O( n k )</math> time. However, there is an even faster solution that involves a different parametrization of the problem:\n\nLet <math>k</math> be the total number of floors such that the eggs break when dropped from the <math>k</math>th floor (The example above is equivalent to taking <math>k=37</math>).\n\nLet <math>m</math> be the minimum floor from which the egg must be dropped to be broken.\n\nLet <math>f(t,n)</math> be the maximum number of values of <math>m</math> that are distinguishable using <math>t</math> tries and <math>n</math> eggs.\n\nThen <math>f(t,0) = f(0,n) = 1</math> for all <math>t,n \\geq 0</math>.\n\nLet <math>a</math> be the floor from which the first egg is dropped in the optimal strategy.\n\nIf the first egg broke, <math>m</math> is from <math>1</math> to <math>a</math> and distinguishable using at most <math>t-1</math> tries and <math>n-1</math> eggs.\n\nIf the first egg did not break, <math>m</math> is from <math>a+1</math> to <math>k</math> and distinguishable using <math>t-1</math> tries and <math>n</math> eggs.\n\nTherefore, <math>f(t,n) = f(t-1,n-1) + f(t-1,n)</math>.\n\nThen the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum <math>x</math> such that <math>f(x,n) \\geq k</math>.\n\nTo do so, we could compute <math>\\{ f(t,i) : 0 \\leq i \\leq n \\}</math> in order of increasing <math>t</math>, which would take <math>O( n x )</math> time.\n\nThus, if we separately handle the case of <math>n=1</math>, the algorithm would take <math>O( n \\sqrt{k} )</math> time.\n\nBut the recurrence relation can in fact be solved, giving <math>f(t,n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}{ \\binom{t}{i} }</math>, which can be computed in <math>O(n)</math> time using the identity <math>\\binom{t}{i+1} = \\binom{t}{i} \\frac{t-i}{i+1}</math> for all <math>i \\geq 0</math>.\n\nSince <math>f(t,n) \\leq f(t+1,n)</math> for all <math>t \\geq 0</math>, we can binary search on <math>t</math> to find <math>x</math>, giving an <math>O( n \\log k )</math> algorithm.\n<ref>{{Citation |author=Dean Connable Wills |title=Connections between combinatorics of permutations and algorithms and geometry |url=https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/11929?show=full}}</ref>\n\n=== Matrix chain multiplication ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n{{Main|Matrix chain multiplication}}\n<!--Show how the placement of parentheses affects the number of scalar multiplications required when multiplying a bunch of matrices.\nShow how to write a dynamic program to calculate the optimal parentheses placement.\nThis is such a long example that it might be better to make it its own article.-->\n\nMatrix chain multiplication is a well-known example that demonstrates utility of dynamic programming. For example,  engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100\u00d7100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices {{tmath|A_1, A_2, .... A_n}}. As we know from basic linear algebra, matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:\n\n: {{math|((A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 A<sub>3</sub>) \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>}}\n\n: {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7(((A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>)\u00d7 ... ) \u00d7 A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\n: {{math|(A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 (A<sub>3</sub> \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\nand so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m\u00d7n and matrix B has dimensions n\u00d7q, then matrix C=A\u00d7B will have dimensions m\u00d7q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).\n\nFor example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m\u00d7n, n\u00d7p, and p\u00d7s, respectively. Matrix A\u00d7B\u00d7C will be of size m\u00d7s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:\n\n# Ax(B\u00d7C)    This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications.  \n# (A\u00d7B)\u00d7C    This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.\n\nLet us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.\n\nAt this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.\n\nLet's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. A<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 .... \u00d7 A<sub>j</sub>, i.e. i<=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i <= k < j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].\n\nThe formula is:\n\n        '''if''' i = j, m[i,j]= 0\n        '''if''' i < j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k {{nowrap|(m[i,k]+m[k+1,j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>)}} \nwhere ''k'' ranges from ''i'' to ''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\n*{{tmath|p_{{(}}i-1{{)}}}} is the row dimension of matrix i,\n*{{tmath|p_k}} is the column dimension of matrix k,\n*{{tmath|p_j}} is the column dimension of matrix j.\n\nThis formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter \"chain\" is the chain of matrices, i.e. {{tmath|A_1, A_2, ... A_n}}:\n\n  '''function''' OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain)\n      n = length(chain)\n      '''for''' i = 1, n\n          m[i,i] = 0    ''// Since it takes no calculations to multiply one matrix''\n      '''for''' len = 2, n\n          '''for''' i = 1, n - len + 1\n              j = i + len -1\n              m[i,j] = infinity      ''// So that the first calculation updates''\n              '''for''' k = i, j-1\n                  {{nowrap|1=q = m[i, k] + m[k+1, j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>}}\n                  '''if''' q < m[i, j]     ''// The new order of parentheses is better than what we had''\n                      m[i, j] = q    ''// Update''\n                      s[i, j] = k    ''// Record which k to split on, i.e. where to place the parenthesis''\n\nSo far, we have calculated values for all possible {{math|''m''[''i'', ''j'']}}, the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix ''i'' to matrix ''j'', and we have recorded the corresponding \"split point\"{{math|''s''[''i'', ''j'']}}. For example, if we are multiplying chain {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>\u00d7A<sub>4</sub>}}, and it turns out that {{math|1=''m''[1, 3] = 100}} and {{math|1=''s''[1, 3] = 2}}, that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is {{tmath|(A_1\\times A_2)\\times A_3}} and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculation.\n\nThis algorithm will produce \"tables\" ''m''[, ] and ''s''[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:\n\n  '''function''' PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)\n      '''if''' i = j\n         print \"A\"i\n      '''else'''\n         print \"(\" PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j]) PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) \")\"\n\nOf course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.\n\nTo actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:\n<source lang=\"javascript\" enclose=\"div\">\n   function MatrixChainMultiply(chain from 1 to n)       // returns the final matrix, i.e. A1\u00d7A2\u00d7... \u00d7An\n      OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain from 1 to n)   // this will produce s[ . ] and m[ . ] \"tables\"\n      OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, chain from 1 to n)  // actually multiply\n\n   function OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, j)   // returns the result of multiplying a chain of matrices from Ai to Aj in optimal way\n      if i < j\n         // keep on splitting the chain and multiplying the matrices in left and right sides\n         LeftSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, s[i, j])\n         RightSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, s[i, j] + 1, j)\n         return MatrixMultiply(LeftSide, RightSide) \n      else if i = j\n         return Ai   // matrix at position i\n      else \n         print \"error, i <= j must hold\"\n\n    function MatrixMultiply(A, B)    // function that multiplies two matrices\n      if columns(A) = rows(B) \n         for i = 1, rows(A)\n            for j = 1, columns(B)\n               C[i, j] = 0\n               for k = 1, columns(A)\n                   C[i, j] = C[i, j] + A[i, k]*B[k, j] \n               return C \n      else \n          print \"error, incompatible dimensions.\"\n</source>\n\n== History ==\nThe term ''dynamic programming'' was originally used in the 1940s by [[Richard Bellman]] to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another.  By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,<ref>Stuart Dreyfus. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf \"Richard Bellman on the birth of Dynamical Programming\"].</ref>  and the field was thereafter recognized by the [[IEEE]] as a [[systems analysis]] and [[engineering]] topic.  Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the [[Bellman equation]], a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] form.\n\nBellman explains the reasoning behind the term ''dynamic programming'' in his autobiography, ''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'':\n\n{{Quote\n|text=I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Wilson]]. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I\u2019m not using the term lightly; I\u2019m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word \"programming\". I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n|author=Richard Bellman\n|source=''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'' (1984, page 159)\n}}\n\nThe word ''dynamic'' was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive.<ref name=\"Eddy\">{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=S.

As Russell and Norvig in their book have written, referring to the above story: \"This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=S. |last2=Norvig |first2=P. |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-13-207148-2 }}</ref> Also, there is a comment in a speech by [http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award/2004-00-00t000000/harold-j-kushner Harold J.

The method was developed by [[Richard Bellman]] in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from [[aerospace engineering]] to [[economics]]. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a [[Recursion|recursive]] manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have [[optimal substructure]].\n\nIf sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.<ref name=\":0\">Cormen, T. H.; Leiserson, C. E.; Rivest, R. L.; Stein, C. (2001), Introduction to Algorithms (2nd ed.), MIT Press & McGraw\u2013Hill, {{ISBN|0-262-03293-7}} . pp. 344.</ref> In the optimization literature this relationship is called the [[Bellman equation]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\n=== Mathematical optimization ===\nIn terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of '''value functions''' ''V''<sub>1</sub>, ''V''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''V''<sub>''n''</sub> taking ''y'' as an argument representing the '''[[State variable|state]]''' of the system at times ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. The definition of ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''y'') is the value obtained in state ''y'' at the last time ''n''. The values ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at earlier times ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;1,&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1 can be found by working backwards, using a [[Recursion|recursive]] relationship called the [[Bellman equation]]. For ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n'', ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> at any state ''y'' is calculated from ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time ''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 and the function ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> for those states. Finally, ''V''<sub>1</sub> at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.\n\n=== Control theory ===\nIn [[control theory]], a typical problem is to find an admissible control <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}</math> which causes the system <math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right)</math> to follow an admissible trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> on a continuous time interval <math>t_{0} \\leq t \\leq t_{1}</math> that minimizes a [[Loss function|cost function]]\n:<math>J = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\mathrm{d} t</math> \nThe solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} = h(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)</math>, which produces an optimal trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> and an optimized loss function <math>J^{\\ast}</math>. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming:\n:<math>- J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\min_{\\mathbf{u}} \\left\\{ f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) + J_{x}^{\\ast \\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\right\\}</math>\na [[partial differential equation]] known as the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]], in which <math>J_{x}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{1}} ~~~~ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{2}} ~~~~ \\dots ~~~~  \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{n}} \\right]^{\\mathsf{T}}</math> and <math>J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial t}</math>. One finds the minimizing <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> in terms of <math>t</math>, <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, and the unknown function <math>J_{x}^{\\ast}</math> and then substitutes the result into the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation to get the partial differential equation to be solved with boundary condition <math>J \\left( t_{1} \\right) = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right)</math>.<ref>{{cite book |first=M.

In Ramsey's problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of [[utility]]. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in [[Physical capital|capital stock]] that is used in production), known as [[intertemporal choice]]. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate <math>\\beta \\in (0,1)</math>. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by\n:<math>k_{t+1} = \\hat{g} \\left( k_{t}, c_{t} \\right) = f(k_{t}) - c_{t}</math>\nwhere <math>c</math> is consumption, <math>k</math> is capital, and <math>f</math> is a [[production function]] satisfying the [[Inada conditions]]. An initial capital stock <math>k_{0} > 0</math> is assumed.\n\nLet <math>c_t</math> be consumption in period {{mvar|t}}, and assume consumption yields [[utility]] <math>u(c_t)=\\ln(c_t)</math> as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he [[discounting|discounts]] future utility by a factor {{mvar|b}} each period, where <math>0<b<1</math>. Let <math>k_t</math> be [[capital (economics)|capital]] in period {{mvar|t}}. Assume initial capital is a given amount <math>k_0>0</math>, and suppose that this period's capital and consumption determine next period's capital as <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t</math>, where {{mvar|A}} is a positive constant and <math>0<a<1</math>. Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer's decision problem can be written as follows:\n\n: <math>\\max \\sum_{t=0}^T b^t \\ln(c_t)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math> for all <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>\n\nWritten this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables <math>c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots , c_T</math>. (The capital <math>k_0</math> is not a choice variable\u2014the consumer's initial capital is taken as given.)\n\nThe dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of ''value functions'' <math>V_t(k)</math>, for <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T,T+1</math> which represent the value of having any amount of capital {{mvar|k}} at each time {{mvar|t}}. There is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death, <math>V_{T+1}(k)=0</math>.\n\nThe value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by [[backward induction]] using the [[Bellman equation]]. In this problem, for each <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>, the Bellman equation is\n\n: <math>V_t(k_t) \\, = \\, \\max \\left( \\ln(c_t) + b V_{t+1}(k_{t+1}) \\right)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math>\n\nThis problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, <math>c_t</math> and <math>k_{t+1}</math>. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time {{mvar|t}}, his current capital <math>k_t</math> is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption <math>c_t</math> and saving <math>k_{t+1}</math>.\n\nTo actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as {{mvar|k}}. <math>V_{T+1}(k)</math> is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate <math>V_T(k)</math>, and so on until we get to <math>V_0(k)</math>, which is the ''value'' of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know <math>V_{T-j+1}(k)</math>, we can calculate <math>V_{T-j}(k)</math>, which is the maximum of <math>\\ln(c_{T-j}) + b V_{T-j+1}(Ak^a-c_{T-j})</math>, where <math>c_{T-j}</math> is the choice variable and <math>Ak^a-c_{T-j} \\ge 0</math>.\n\nWorking backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>V_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, a \\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i \\ln k + v_{T-j}</math>\n\nwhere each <math>v_{T-j}</math> is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>c_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i} Ak^a</math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nc_{T}(k) & = Ak^a\\\\\nc_{T-1}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab}\\\\\nc_{T-2}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2}\\\\\n&\\dots\\\\\nc_2(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}}\\\\\nc_1(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}}\\\\\nc_0(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}+a^Tb^T}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period {{mvar|T}}, the last period of life.\n\n=== Computer programming ===\nThere are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: [[optimal substructure]] and [[overlapping subproblem|overlapping sub-problem]]s. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to ''non-overlapping'' sub-problems, the strategy is called \"[[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]\" instead.<ref name=\":0\" />  This is why [[mergesort|merge sort]] and [[quicksort|quick sort]] are not classified as dynamic programming problems.\n\n''Optimal substructure'' means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of [[recursion]]. For example, given a graph ''G=(V,E)'', the shortest path ''p'' from a vertex ''u'' to a vertex ''v'' exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex ''w'' on this shortest path ''p''. If ''p'' is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths ''p<sub>1</sub>'' from ''u'' to ''w'' and ''p<sub>2</sub>'' from ''w'' to ''v'' such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]''). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]] or the [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm]] does.\n\n''Overlapping'' sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> + ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;2</sub>, with base case ''F''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. Then ''F''<sub>43</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>42</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>, and ''F''<sub>42</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>40</sub>. Now ''F''<sub>41</sub> is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both ''F''<sub>43</sub> as well as ''F''<sub>42</sub>. Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.\n\n[[Image:Fibonacci dynamic programming.svg|thumb|108px|'''Figure 2.''' The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. The fact that it is not a [[tree structure|tree]] indicates overlapping subproblems.]]\n\nThis can be achieved in either of two ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Top-down approach]]'': This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily [[memoize]] or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Bottom-up approach]]'': Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of ''F''<sub>41</sub> and ''F''<sub>40</sub>, we can directly calculate the value of ''F''<sub>42</sub>.\n\nSome [[programming language]]s can automatically [[memoization|memoize]] the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up [[call-by-name]] evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as ''[[call-by-need]]''). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Perl]] or [[D (programming language)|D]]). Some languages have automatic [[memoization]] <!-- still not a typo for \"memor-\" --> built in, such as tabled [[Prolog]] and [[J (programming language)|J]], which supports memoization with the ''M.'' adverb.<ref>{{cite web|title=M.

Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as [[Wolfram Language]].\n\n=== Bioinformatics ===\nDynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for the tasks such as [[sequence alignment]], [[protein folding]], RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by [[Charles DeLisi]] in USA<ref>DeLisi, Biopolymers, 1974, Volume 13, Issue 7, pages 1511\u20131512, July 1974</ref> and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR.<ref>Gurski\u012d GV, Zasedatelev AS, Biofizika, 1978 Sep-Oct;23(5):932-46</ref> Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of [[nucleosome]] positioning and [[transcription factor]] binding.\n\n== Examples: Computer algorithms ==\n\n=== Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem ===\nFrom a dynamic programming point of view, [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for the [[shortest path problem]]  is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the '''Reaching''' method.<ref name=sniedovich_06>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dijkstra's algorithm revisited: the dynamic programming connexion | journal = Journal of Control and Cybernetics | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 599\u2013620 | year = 2006 | url = http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/cc/cc35/cc3536.pdf | postscript = .}} [http://www.ifors.ms.unimelb.edu.au/tutorial/dijkstra_new/index.html Online version of the paper with interactive computational modules.]</ref><ref name=denardo_03>{{Citation | last = Denardo | first = E.V. | title = Dynamic Programming: Models and Applications | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | location = Mineola, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-486-42810-9}}</ref><ref name=sniedovich_10>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4099-3  }}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Dijkstra's explanation of the logic behind the algorithm,<ref>{{harvnb|Dijkstra|1959|p=270}}</ref> namely\n{{quote|\n'''Problem 2.'''

Here is a na\u00efve implementation, based directly on the mathematical definition:\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n <= 1 '''return''' n\n        '''return''' fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n\nNotice that if we call, say, <code>fib(5)</code>, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:\n\n# <code>fib(5)</code>\n# <code>fib(4) + fib(3)</code>\n# <code>(fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>((fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>(((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n\nIn particular, <code>fib(2)</code> was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of <code>fib</code>, or ''subproblems'', are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.\n\nNow, suppose we have a simple [[Associative array|map]] object, ''m'', which maps each value of <code>fib</code> that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') time instead of exponential time (but requires [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') space):\n\n    '''var''' m := '''''map'''''(0 \u2192 0, 1 \u2192 1)\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if ''key''''' n '''is not in ''map''''' m \n            m[n] := fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n        '''return''' m[n]\n\nThis technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called ''[[memoization]]''; <!-- Yes, memoization, not memorization. Not a typo. --> this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.\n\nIn the '''bottom-up''' approach, we calculate the smaller values of <code>fib</code> first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(''n'') time since it contains a loop that repeats n \u2212 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(''n'') space to store the map.\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n = 0\n            '''return''' 0\n        '''else'''\n            '''var''' previousFib := 0, currentFib := 1\n            '''repeat''' n \u2212 1 '''times''' ''// loop is skipped if n = 1''\n                '''var''' newFib := previousFib + currentFib\n                previousFib := currentFib\n                currentFib  := newFib\n        '''return''' currentFib\n\nIn both examples, we only calculate <code>fib(2)</code> one time, and then use it to calculate both <code>fib(4)</code> and <code>fib(3)</code>, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.\n\nThe above method actually takes <math>\\Omega(n^2)</math> time for large n because addition of two integers with <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits each takes <math>\\Omega(n)</math> time. (The ''n''<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number has <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits.) Also, there is a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence, [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet#Binet's Fibonacci number formula|known as Binet's formula]], from which the <math>n</math>-th term can be [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations|computed]] in approximately <math>O(n(\\log n)^2)</math> time, which is more efficient than the above dynamic programming technique. However, the simple recurrence directly gives [[Fibonacci sequence#Matrix form|the matrix form]] that leads to an approximately <math>O(n\\log n)</math> algorithm by fast [[matrix exponentiation]].\n\n=== A type of balanced 0\u20131 matrix ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an {{math|<var>n</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} matrix, with {{math|<var>n</var>}} even, so that each row and each column contains exactly {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given <math>n</math>. For example, when {{math|<var>n</var> {{=}} 4}}, four possible solutions are\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThere are at least three possible approaches: [[Brute-force search|brute force]], [[backtracking]], and dynamic programming.\n\nBrute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns ({{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones). As there are <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}^n</math> possible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to <math>n=6</math>.\n\nBacktracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}}. While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for {{math|<var>n</var>}} larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for {{math|<var>n</var>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;8, as we shall see.\n\nDynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row \u2013 what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} boards, where {{math|1 &le; <var>k</var> &le; <var>n</var>}}, whose <math>k</math> rows contain <math>n/2</math> zeros and <math>n/2</math> ones. The function ''f'' to which [[memoization]] is applied maps vectors of ''n'' pairs of integers to the number of admissible boards (solutions). There is one pair for each column, and its two components indicate respectively the number of zeros and ones that have yet to be placed in that column. We seek the value of <math> f((n/2, n/2), (n/2, n/2), \\ldots (n/2, n/2)) </math> (<math>n</math> arguments or one vector of <math>n</math> elements). The process of subproblem creation involves iterating over every one of  <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}</math> possible assignments for the top row of the board, and going through every column, subtracting one from the appropriate element of the pair for that column, depending on whether the assignment for the top row contained a zero or a one at that position. If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining {{math|(<var>k</var> &minus; 1) &times; <var>n</var>}} board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized. The base case is the trivial subproblem, which occurs for a {{math|1 &times; <var>n</var>}} board. The number of solutions for this board is either zero or one, depending on whether the vector is a permutation of {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(0, 1)</math> and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(1, 0)</math> pairs or not.\n\nFor example, in the first two boards shown above the sequences of vectors would be\n<PRE WIDTH=80>\n((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))       ((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))     k = 4\n  0      1      0      1              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 2) (2, 1) (1, 2) (2, 1))       ((1, 2) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 1))     k = 3\n  1      0      1      0              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1))       ((0, 2) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 0))     k = 2\n  0      1      0      1              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 1) (1, 0) (0, 1) (1, 0))       ((0, 1) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 0))     k = 1\n  1      0      1      0              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0))       ((0, 0) (0, 0), (0, 0) (0, 0))\n</PRE>\n\nThe number of solutions {{OEIS|id=A058527}} is\n\n:<math> 1,\\, 2,\\,  90,\\, 297200,\\, 116963796250,\\, 6736218287430460752, \\ldots </math>\n\nLinks to the MAPLE implementation of the dynamic programming approach may be found among the [[Dynamic programming#External links|external links]].\n\n=== Checkerboard ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider a [[checkerboard]] with ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' squares and a cost function <code>c(i, j)</code> which returns a cost associated with square <code>(i,j)</code> (<code>''i''</code> being the row, <code>''j''</code> being the column). For instance (on a 5 \u00d7 5 checkerboard),\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n| 6 || 7 || 4 || 7 || 8\n|-\n! 4\n| 7 || 6 || 1 || 1 || 4\n|-\n! 3\n| 3 || 5 || 7 || 8 || 2\n|-\n! 2\n| \u2013 || 6 || 7 || 0 || \u2013\n|-\n! 1\n| \u2013 || \u2013 || *5* || \u2013 || \u2013\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\nThus <code>c(1, 3) = 5</code>\n\nLet us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (the sum of the minimum costs at each visited rank) to get to the last rank; assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on <code>(1,3)</code> can move to <code>(2,2)</code>, <code>(2,3)</code> or <code>(2,4)</code>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  || x  || x || x ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  || o ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\nThis problem exhibits '''optimal substructure'''. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function <code>q(i, j)</code> as\n\n:''q''(''i'', ''j'') = the minimum cost to reach square (''i'', ''j'').\n\nStarting at rank <code>n</code> and descending to rank <code>1</code>, we compute the value of this function for all the squares at each successive rank. Picking the square that holds the minimum value at each rank gives us the shortest path between rank <code>n</code> and rank <code>1</code>.\n\nThe function <code>q(i, j)</code> is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus <code>c(i, j)</code>. For instance:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  || A  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  || B || C || D ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\n: <math>q(A) = \\min(q(B),q(C),q(D))+c(A) \\, </math>\n\nNow, let us define <code>q(i, j)</code> in somewhat more general terms:\n\n: <math>q(i,j)=\\begin{cases} \\infty & j < 1 \\text{ or }j > n \\\\ c(i, j) & i = 1 \\\\ \\min(q(i-1, j-1), q(i-1, j), q(i-1, j+1)) + c(i,j) & \\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe first line of this equation deals with a board modeled as squares indexed on <code>1</code> at the lowest bound and <code>n</code> at the highest bound. The second line specifies what happens at the last rank; providing a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It represents the <code>A,B,C,D</code> terms in the example. From this definition we can derive straightforward recursive code for <code>q(i,\u00a0j)</code>. In the following pseudocode, <code>n</code> is the size of the board, <code>c(i, j)</code> is the cost function, and <code>min()</code> returns the minimum of a number of values:\n\n '''function''' minCost(i, j)\n     '''if''' j &lt; 1 '''or''' j > n\n         '''return''' infinity\n     '''else if''' i = 1\n         '''return''' c(i, j)\n     '''else'''\n         '''return''' '''min'''( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)\n\nThis function only computes the path cost, not the actual path. We discuss the actual path below. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow because it too exhibits the '''overlapping sub-problems''' attribute. That is, it recomputes the same path costs over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path costs in a two-dimensional array <code>q[i, j]</code> rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; all the values needed for array <code>q[i, j]</code> are computed ahead of time only once. Precomputed values for <code>(i,j)</code> are simply looked-up whenever needed.\n\nWe also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array <code>p[i, j]</code>; a ''predecessor array''. This array records the path to any square <code>s</code>. The predecessor of <code>s</code> is modeled as an offset relative to the index (in <code>q[i, j]</code>) of the precomputed path cost of <code>s</code>. To reconstruct the complete path, we lookup the predecessor of <code>s</code>, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on recursively, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following code:\n\n  '''function''' computeShortestPathArrays()\n      '''for''' x '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n          q[1, x] := c(1, x)\n      '''for''' y '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n          q[y, 0]     := infinity\n          q[y, n + 1] := infinity\n      '''for''' y '''from''' 2 '''to''' n\n          '''for''' x '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n              m := min(q[y-1, x-1], q[y-1, x], q[y-1, x+1])\n              q[y, x] := m + c(y, x)\n              '''if''' m = q[y-1, x-1]\n                  p[y, x] := -1\n              '''else if''' m = q[y-1, x]\n                  p[y, x] :=  0\n              '''else'''\n                  p[y, x] :=  1\n\nNow the rest is a simple matter of finding the minimum and printing it.\n\n  '''function''' computeShortestPath()\n      computeShortestPathArrays()\n      minIndex := 1\n      min := q[n, 1]\n      '''for''' i '''from''' 2 '''to''' n\n          '''if''' q[n, i] &lt; min\n              minIndex := i\n              min := q[n, i]\n      printPath(n, minIndex)\n\n  '''function''' printPath(y, x)\n      '''print'''(x)\n      '''print'''(\"&lt;-\")\n      '''if''' y = 2\n          '''print'''(x + p[y, x])\n      '''else'''\n          printPath(y-1, x + p[y, x])\n\n=== Sequence alignment ===\nIn [[genetics]], [[sequence alignment]] is an important application where dynamic programming is essential.<ref name=\"Eddy\"/>  Typically, the problem consists of transforming one sequence into another using edit operations that replace, insert, or remove an element.  Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the [[edit distance|sequence of edits with the lowest total cost]].\n\nThe problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:\n\n# inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B\n# deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B\n# replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.\n\nThe partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j].  The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.\n\nDifferent variants exist, see [[Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm]] and [[Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm]].\n\n=== Tower of Hanoi puzzle ===\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|A model set of the Towers of Hanoi (with 8 disks)]]\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|300px|thumb|An animated solution of the '''Tower of Hanoi''' puzzle for ''T(4,3)''.]]\nThe '''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' or '''Towers of [[Hanoi]]''' is a [[mathematical game]] or [[puzzle]]. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:\n\n* Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.\n* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe dynamic programming solution consists of solving the [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]\n\n: S(n,h,t) = S(n-1,h, not(h,t)) ; S(1,h,t) ; S(n-1,not(h,t),t)\n\nwhere n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), \";\" denotes concatenation, and\n\n: S(n, h, t) := solution to a problem consisting of n disks that are to be moved from rod h to rod t.\n\nFor n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = \"move a disk from rod h to rod t\" (there is only one disk left).\n\nThe  number of moves required by this solution is 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. If the objective is to '''maximize''' the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]  is slightly more complicated and  3<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 moves are required.<ref>{{Citation |author=Moshe Sniedovich |title= OR/MS Games: 2.

(1996). [https://books.google.by/books?id=ElSi5V5uS2MC&printsec=frontcover&hl=ru#v=onepage&q&f=false Which way did the Bicycle Go?] Dolciani Mathematical Expositions \u2013 No 18.  [[The Mathematical Association of America]].</ref> \n:Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing (using [[U.S. English]] terminology, in which the first floor is at ground level). We make a few assumptions:\n\n:* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.\n:* A broken egg must be discarded.\n:* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.\n:* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.\n:* If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.\n:* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.\n\n: If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the lowest number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?\n\nTo derive a dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]] for this puzzle, let the '''state''' of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where\n\n: ''n'' = number of test eggs available, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., ''N''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n: ''k'' = number of (consecutive) floors yet to be tested, ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''H''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\nFor instance, ''s'' = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is ''s'' = (''N'',''H'') where ''N'' denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (''n'' = 0) or when ''k'' = 0, whichever occurs first. If termination occurs at state ''s'' = (0,''k'') and ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, then the test failed.\n\nNow, let\n\n: ''W''(''n'',''k'') = minimum number of trials required to identify the value of the critical floor under the worst-case scenario given that the process is in state ''s'' = (''n'',''k'').\n\nThen it can be shown that<ref name=\"sniedovich_03\">Sniedovich, M.

This can be improved to <math>O( n k \\log k )</math> time by binary searching on the optimal <math>x</math> in the above recurrence, since <math>W(n-1,x-1)</math> is increasing in <math>x</math> while <math>W(n,k-x)</math> is decreasing in <math>x</math>, thus a local minimum of <math>\\max(W(n-1,x-1),W(n,k-x))</math> is a global minimum. Also, by storing the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell in the DP table and referring to its value for the previous cell, the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell can be found in constant time, improving it to <math>O( n k )</math> time. However, there is an even faster solution that involves a different parametrization of the problem:\n\nLet <math>k</math> be the total number of floors such that the eggs break when dropped from the <math>k</math>th floor (The example above is equivalent to taking <math>k=37</math>).\n\nLet <math>m</math> be the minimum floor from which the egg must be dropped to be broken.\n\nLet <math>f(t,n)</math> be the maximum number of values of <math>m</math> that are distinguishable using <math>t</math> tries and <math>n</math> eggs.\n\nThen <math>f(t,0) = f(0,n) = 1</math> for all <math>t,n \\geq 0</math>.\n\nLet <math>a</math> be the floor from which the first egg is dropped in the optimal strategy.\n\nIf the first egg broke, <math>m</math> is from <math>1</math> to <math>a</math> and distinguishable using at most <math>t-1</math> tries and <math>n-1</math> eggs.\n\nIf the first egg did not break, <math>m</math> is from <math>a+1</math> to <math>k</math> and distinguishable using <math>t-1</math> tries and <math>n</math> eggs.\n\nTherefore, <math>f(t,n) = f(t-1,n-1) + f(t-1,n)</math>.\n\nThen the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum <math>x</math> such that <math>f(x,n) \\geq k</math>.\n\nTo do so, we could compute <math>\\{ f(t,i) : 0 \\leq i \\leq n \\}</math> in order of increasing <math>t</math>, which would take <math>O( n x )</math> time.\n\nThus, if we separately handle the case of <math>n=1</math>, the algorithm would take <math>O( n \\sqrt{k} )</math> time.\n\nBut the recurrence relation can in fact be solved, giving <math>f(t,n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}{ \\binom{t}{i} }</math>, which can be computed in <math>O(n)</math> time using the identity <math>\\binom{t}{i+1} = \\binom{t}{i} \\frac{t-i}{i+1}</math> for all <math>i \\geq 0</math>.\n\nSince <math>f(t,n) \\leq f(t+1,n)</math> for all <math>t \\geq 0</math>, we can binary search on <math>t</math> to find <math>x</math>, giving an <math>O( n \\log k )</math> algorithm.\n<ref>{{Citation |author=Dean Connable Wills |title=Connections between combinatorics of permutations and algorithms and geometry |url=https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/11929?show=full}}</ref>\n\n=== Matrix chain multiplication ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n{{Main|Matrix chain multiplication}}\n<!--Show how the placement of parentheses affects the number of scalar multiplications required when multiplying a bunch of matrices.\nShow how to write a dynamic program to calculate the optimal parentheses placement.\nThis is such a long example that it might be better to make it its own article.-->\n\nMatrix chain multiplication is a well-known example that demonstrates utility of dynamic programming. For example,  engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100\u00d7100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices {{tmath|A_1, A_2, .... A_n}}. As we know from basic linear algebra, matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:\n\n: {{math|((A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 A<sub>3</sub>) \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>}}\n\n: {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7(((A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>)\u00d7 ... ) \u00d7 A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\n: {{math|(A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 (A<sub>3</sub> \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\nand so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m\u00d7n and matrix B has dimensions n\u00d7q, then matrix C=A\u00d7B will have dimensions m\u00d7q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).\n\nFor example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m\u00d7n, n\u00d7p, and p\u00d7s, respectively. Matrix A\u00d7B\u00d7C will be of size m\u00d7s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:\n\n# Ax(B\u00d7C)    This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications.  \n# (A\u00d7B)\u00d7C    This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.\n\nLet us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.\n\nAt this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.\n\nLet's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. A<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 .... \u00d7 A<sub>j</sub>, i.e. i<=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i <= k < j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].\n\nThe formula is:\n\n        '''if''' i = j, m[i,j]= 0\n        '''if''' i < j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k {{nowrap|(m[i,k]+m[k+1,j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>)}} \nwhere ''k'' ranges from ''i'' to ''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\n*{{tmath|p_{{(}}i-1{{)}}}} is the row dimension of matrix i,\n*{{tmath|p_k}} is the column dimension of matrix k,\n*{{tmath|p_j}} is the column dimension of matrix j.\n\nThis formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter \"chain\" is the chain of matrices, i.e. {{tmath|A_1, A_2, ... A_n}}:\n\n  '''function''' OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain)\n      n = length(chain)\n      '''for''' i = 1, n\n          m[i,i] = 0    ''// Since it takes no calculations to multiply one matrix''\n      '''for''' len = 2, n\n          '''for''' i = 1, n - len + 1\n              j = i + len -1\n              m[i,j] = infinity      ''// So that the first calculation updates''\n              '''for''' k = i, j-1\n                  {{nowrap|1=q = m[i, k] + m[k+1, j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>}}\n                  '''if''' q < m[i, j]     ''// The new order of parentheses is better than what we had''\n                      m[i, j] = q    ''// Update''\n                      s[i, j] = k    ''// Record which k to split on, i.e. where to place the parenthesis''\n\nSo far, we have calculated values for all possible {{math|''m''[''i'', ''j'']}}, the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix ''i'' to matrix ''j'', and we have recorded the corresponding \"split point\"{{math|''s''[''i'', ''j'']}}. For example, if we are multiplying chain {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>\u00d7A<sub>4</sub>}}, and it turns out that {{math|1=''m''[1, 3] = 100}} and {{math|1=''s''[1, 3] = 2}}, that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is {{tmath|(A_1\\times A_2)\\times A_3}} and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculation.\n\nThis algorithm will produce \"tables\" ''m''[, ] and ''s''[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:\n\n  '''function''' PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)\n      '''if''' i = j\n         print \"A\"i\n      '''else'''\n         print \"(\" PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j]) PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) \")\"\n\nOf course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.\n\nTo actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:\n<source lang=\"javascript\" enclose=\"div\">\n   function MatrixChainMultiply(chain from 1 to n)       // returns the final matrix, i.e. A1\u00d7A2\u00d7... \u00d7An\n      OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain from 1 to n)   // this will produce s[ . ] and m[ . ] \"tables\"\n      OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, chain from 1 to n)  // actually multiply\n\n   function OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, j)   // returns the result of multiplying a chain of matrices from Ai to Aj in optimal way\n      if i < j\n         // keep on splitting the chain and multiplying the matrices in left and right sides\n         LeftSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, s[i, j])\n         RightSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, s[i, j] + 1, j)\n         return MatrixMultiply(LeftSide, RightSide) \n      else if i = j\n         return Ai   // matrix at position i\n      else \n         print \"error, i <= j must hold\"\n\n    function MatrixMultiply(A, B)    // function that multiplies two matrices\n      if columns(A) = rows(B) \n         for i = 1, rows(A)\n            for j = 1, columns(B)\n               C[i, j] = 0\n               for k = 1, columns(A)\n                   C[i, j] = C[i, j] + A[i, k]*B[k, j] \n               return C \n      else \n          print \"error, incompatible dimensions.\"\n</source>\n\n== History ==\nThe term ''dynamic programming'' was originally used in the 1940s by [[Richard Bellman]] to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another.  By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,<ref>Stuart Dreyfus. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf \"Richard Bellman on the birth of Dynamical Programming\"].</ref>  and the field was thereafter recognized by the [[IEEE]] as a [[systems analysis]] and [[engineering]] topic.  Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the [[Bellman equation]], a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] form.\n\nBellman explains the reasoning behind the term ''dynamic programming'' in his autobiography, ''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'':\n\n{{Quote\n|text=I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Wilson]]. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I\u2019m not using the term lightly; I\u2019m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word \"programming\". I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n|author=Richard Bellman\n|source=''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'' (1984, page 159)\n}}\n\nThe word ''dynamic'' was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive.<ref name=\"Eddy\">{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=S.

J. |title=Numerical Optimization |page=9 |publisher=Springer |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe above explanation of the origin of the term is lacking. As Russell and Norvig in their book have written, referring to the above story: \"This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=S. |last2=Norvig |first2=P. |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-13-207148-2 }}</ref> Also, there is a comment in a speech by [http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award/2004-00-00t000000/harold-j-kushner Harold J. Kushner], where he remembers Bellman. Quoting Kushner as he speaks of Bellman: \"On the other hand, when I asked him the same question, he replied that he was trying to upstage Dantzig's linear programming by adding dynamic. Perhaps both motivations were true.\"\n\n== Algorithms that use dynamic programming ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n* Recurrent solutions to [[lattice models]] for protein-DNA binding\n* [[Backward induction]] as a solution method for finite-horizon [[discrete-time]] dynamic optimization problems\n* [[Method of undetermined coefficients]] can be used to solve the [[Bellman equation]] in infinite-horizon, discrete-time, [[discounting|discounted]], [[Time-invariant system|time-invariant]] dynamic optimization problems\n* Many [[String (computer science)|string]] algorithms including [[longest common subsequence problem|longest common subsequence]], [[Longest increasing subsequence problem|longest increasing subsequence]], [[Longest common substring problem|longest common substring]], [[Levenshtein distance]] (edit distance)\n* Many algorithmic problems on [[undirected graph|graphs]] can be solved efficiently for graphs of bounded [[treewidth]] or bounded [[clique-width]] by using dynamic programming on a [[tree decomposition]] of the graph.\n* The [[CYK algorithm|Cocke\u2013Younger\u2013Kasami (CYK) algorithm]] which determines whether and how a given string can be generated by a given [[context-free grammar]]\n* [[Word wrap|Knuth's word wrapping algorithm]] that minimizes raggedness when word wrapping text\n* The use of [[transposition table]]s and [[refutation table]]s in [[computer chess]]\n* The [[Viterbi algorithm]] (used for [[hidden Markov model]]s, and particularly in [[part of speech tagging]])\n* The [[Earley algorithm]] (a type of [[chart parser]])\n* The [[Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm]] and other algorithms used in [[bioinformatics]], including [[sequence alignment]], [[structural alignment]], [[RNA structure|RNA structure prediction]]\n* [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm|Floyd's all-pairs shortest path algorithm]]\n* Optimizing the order for [[chain matrix multiplication]]\n* [[Pseudo-polynomial time]] algorithms for the [[subset sum problem|subset sum]], [[Knapsack problem|knapsack]] and [[Partition problem|partition]] problems\n* The [[dynamic time warping]] algorithm for computing the global distance between two time series\n* The [[Patricia Selinger|Selinger]] (a.k.a.
