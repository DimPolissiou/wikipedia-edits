These predators are attracted to the moths during the male flight displays. ''[[Northern bat|Eptesicus nilssonii]]'', the northern bat, has often been documented preying on lekking ghost moths. The ghost moth is a member of the family Hepialidae, an early branch of [[Lepidoptera]]. Species in the Hepialidae lack several predator defense systems, including [[ultrasonic hearing]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The ghost moth lacks sophisticated predator defense systems, and instead the ghost moth restricts its sexual behavior to a short period during dusk to reduce its predation risk. Despite these precautions, the moth is still at a large predation risk.\n\nIt is believed that the deaf moths, such as the family Hepialidae, predate the predatory bats that may have driven the evolution of ultrasonic hearing. Members of the Hepialidae also lack adaptations that allow for erratic and maneuverable flight as well as color mimicking, two traits that aid in predator defense. It is currently believed that the ghost moth's restricted flight patterns and low flight positions may be the ghost swift's main form of predatory defense.<ref name=\":2\" /> The ghost moth displays for only 20\u201330 minutes at dusk, which aids in predator avoidance, as most bats typically do not start feeding until after dusk, when it is darker outside.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Life history ==\n\n=== Egg ===\nOn average, most female ghost moths will lay around 600 eggs over four days, but a female can lay anywhere from 200 to 1,600 eggs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=C.

Female ghost moths are a yellow brownish color, while males have silver/white wings.

These predators are attracted to the moths during the male flight displays. ''[[Northern bat|Eptesicus nilssonii]]'', the northern bat, has often been documented preying on lekking ghost moths. The ghost moth is a member of the family Hepialidae, an early branch of [[Lepidoptera]]. Species in the Hepialidae lack several predator defense systems, including [[ultrasonic hearing]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The ghost moth lacks sophisticated predator defense systems, and instead the ghost moth restricts its sexual behavior to a short period during dusk to reduce its predation risk. Despite these precautions, the moth is still at a large predation risk.\n\nIt is believed that the deaf moths, such as the family Hepialidae, predate the predatory bats that may have driven the evolution of ultrasonic hearing. Members of the Hepialidae also lack adaptations that allow for erratic and maneuverable flight as well as color mimicking, two traits that aid in predator defense. It is currently believed that the ghost moth's restricted flight patterns and low flight positions may be the ghost swift's main form of predatory defense.<ref name=\":2\" /> The ghost moth displays for only 20\u201330 minutes at dusk, which aids in predator avoidance, as most bats typically do not start feeding until after dusk, when it is darker outside.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Life history ==\n\n=== Egg ===\nOn average, most female ghost moths will lay around 600 eggs over four days, but a female can lay anywhere from 200 to 1,600 eggs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=C.

It is a collection of 692 formula and 170 problems, all derived from the same master diagram of a round town inscribed in a right triangle and a square. They often involve two people who walk on straight lines until they can see each other, meet or reach a tree or pagoda in a certain spot. It is an algebraic geometry book, the purpose of book is to study intricated geometrical relations by algebra.\n\nMajority of the geometry problems are solved by polynomial equations, which are represented using a method called [[tian yuan shu]], \"coefficient array method\" or literally \"method of the celestial unknown\". Li Zhi is the earliest extant source of this method, though it was known before him in some form. It is a positional system of [[rod numeral]]s to represent [[polynomial equation]]s.\n\n''Ceyuan haijing'' was first introduced to the west by the British Protestant Christian missionary to China, [[Alexander Wylie (missionary)|Alexander Wylie]] in his book ''Notes on Chinese Literature'', 1902. He wrote:{{quote|The first page has a diagram of a circle contained in a triangle, which is dissected into 15 figures; the definition and ratios of the several parts are then given, and there are followed by 170 problems, in which the principle of the new science are seen to advantage.

Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the [[combat arms]]. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''', '''horseman''', '''[[dragoon]]''', or '''[[trooper (rank)|trooper]]'''. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any [[Military animal|military forces that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]], mules or [[War elephant|elephants]]. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.\n\nCavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and [[inertial mass]] over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.\n\nThe speed, mobility, and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the [[Ancient era|Ancient]] and [[Horses in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in [[eurasian nomads|nomadic societies of Asia]], notably the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]] and the later [[Mongol Army|Mongol armies]].<ref>\nJohn Keegan, pages 188-189, ''[[A History of Warfare]],'' {{ISBN|0-09-174527-6}}\n</ref> In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured (heavy)]], and eventually evolving into the mounted [[knight]]s of the medieval period. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.\n\nIn [[Interwar period|the period]] between the [[World Wars]], many cavalry units were converted into [[motorized infantry]] and [[mechanized infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during [[World War II]], notably in the [[Red Army]], the [[Mongolian People's Army]], the [[Royal Italian Army]], the [[Romania in World War II|Romanian Army]], the [[Polish Land Forces]], and light reconnaissance units within the [[Waffen SS]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of [[Surveillance and Target Acquisition|reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition]] (RSTA).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Role of cavalry==\n{{Main|Cavalry tactics}}\n[[File:Rytter fra Bagirmi.jpg|thumb|upright|African horseman of [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] in full [[gambeson|padded armour]] suit]]\n\nIn many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of the disposition of the main body of troops, forward security, offensive [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance by combat]], defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, [[relief in place]], linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the \"[[Armoured warfare|armored]]\" designation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|left|[[Assyrian cavalry]]]]\n\nBefore the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].<ref>p. 1, Menon</ref> The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] from 1550 BC as well as the [[Assyrian army]] and [[Babylonia]]n royalty.<ref>Terrence Wise, p. 18, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nThe power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of [[horse]]s (then mostly small) to carry heavy [[armor]]. Nonetheless, there are indications that, from the 15th century BC onwards, horseback riding was practiced amongst the military elites of the great states of the ancient Near East, most notably those in [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]].<ref>https://www.academia.edu/1532320/Horseback_riding_and_Cavalry_in_Mycenaean_Greece</ref>\n\nCavalry techniques, and the rise of true cavalry, were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Iranic]] [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sarmatians]].\n[[File:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]\n\nThe photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865\u2013860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the [[mounted archer]] were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.<ref>Terrence Wise, plate H, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 490 BC a [[Nisean horse|breed of large horses]] was bred in the [[Nisaean plain]] in Media to carry [[Cataphract|men with increasing amounts of armour]] (Herodotus 7,40 & 9,20), but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the fourth century BC the Chinese during the [[Warring States period]] (403&ndash;221 BC) began to use cavalry against rival states,<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\">Ebrey and others, ''Pre-Modern East Asia'', pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref> and by 331 BC when [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive [[scythed chariot]]s. The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=164|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\nHowever, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing.\n\nOutside of mainland Europe, the southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the [[Caledonia]]ns at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius|Mons Graupius]], in 84 AD.\n\n===Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===\n[[File:Amphora Louvre F12.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warrior's departure; an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[amphora]] dated 550\u2013540 BC.]]\n{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}\n\nDuring the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with [[javelin]]s, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using [[lance]]s, had the ability to close in on their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the [[hoplites]] or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=37|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nCavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], their first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by [[Phillip II of Macedon]] when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen,<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=18|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=54|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Macedon]]ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]])<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=17|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> of Philip II of Macedon and [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen<ref>{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Sekunda|page=42|title=Macedonian Armies after Alexander 323-168 BC|ISBN=978-1-84908-714-8}}</ref> called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or \"Horserider\"), Greek \"heavy\" cavalry, armed with [[Kontos (weapon)|kontos]] (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet.The Classic Greek/Roman design later inspired the Classic Revival style of helmets worn by cavalry in the War of 1812.<ref>https://jefpat.maryland.gov/Pages/mac-lab/curators-choice/2020-curators-choice/jacob-huyett-cavalry-helmet.aspx</ref> They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. The effectiveness of this combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquests of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=14\u201322|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Republic and Early Empire===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n{{main|Roman cavalry}}\n[[File:K\u00f6ln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tombstone of a Roman [[auxilia]]ry trooper from [[History of Cologne|Cologne]], Germany. Second half of the first century AD]]\n\nThe cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''\u2014men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. Horses were provided by the Republic and could be withdrawn if neglected or misused, together with the status of being a cavalryman.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=36|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref>\n\nAs the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the [[Second Punic War]] where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the [[Battle of Cannae]], where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortes Equitatae]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their [[Germanic bodyguard|personal bodyguards]] until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].\n\nFor the most part, Roman cavalry during the early Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the standing force comprising a consular army. Except in times of major mobilisation about 1,800 horsemen were maintained, with three hundred attached to each legion.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=36\u201337|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThe relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].\n\nAfter defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Negin|page=6|title=Roman heavy Cavalry (1) Cataphractarii & Clibanarii, 1st Century BC-5th Century AD.|ISBN=978-1-4728-3004-3}}</ref> \nAt the same time heavy spears and shields modelled on those favoured by the horsemen of the Greek city-states were adopted to replace the lighter weaponry of early Rome.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=38|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThese improvements in tactics and equipment reflected those of a thousand years earlier when the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to undertake similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their [[heavy infantry]] supported by auxiliary cavalry.\n\n===Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period===\n[[File:Roman Cavalry 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reenactor as a Roman [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalryman.]]\n\nIn the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.\n\nThe most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Iranian empires, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]s and their [[Persians|Persian]] [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic period]] with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/ |title=Roman-Persian Wars |work=Historynet.com |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,<ref>The raised rear part of a saddle</ref> was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by [[History of Iran|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.\n\nThe late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders\u2014individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Newark|pages=23\u201324|title=Sabre & Lance.

As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.\n[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders II.jpg|thumb|Mongols at war 14th century]]\n\nThe best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the [[Russian Empire]].

The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].\n\nIn 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\" />\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with saddle and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r 626\u2013649), c 650]]\nThe adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c 1600\u20131050 BC).<ref name=\"ebrey 29\">Ebrey, 29.</ref> By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.<ref name=\"ebrey 30\">Ebrey, 30.</ref> The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the fourth century BC;<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 41\">Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.</ref> it was written by the [[Song dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.<ref name=\"peers 130\">Peers, 130. we can right anything</ref>\n\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in ceremonial armor on horseback, painted by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (1688\u20131766)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], dated 1739 or 1758]]\nOn many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279\u20131368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r 141\u201387 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]\u2013[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.\n\nCavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.<ref name=\"Dien\">[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. \"THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY\"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231319/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup \u2013 history of Chinese science\".

By roughly the first century BC, the ancient kingdom of [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] also had mounted warriors.<ref>Ebrey, 120.</ref> The cavalry of [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], were called ''Gaemamusa'' (\uac1c\ub9c8\ubb34\uc0ac, \u93a7\u99ac\u6b66\u58eb), and were renowned as a fearsome heavy cavalry force. [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] often led expeditions into the [[Baekje]], [[Gaya confederacy]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Later Yan]] and against [[Yamato period|Japanese]] invaders with his cavalry.<ref>Lee, Peter H & Wm.

After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general [[Yun Gwan]] realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders (\ub3d9\ubd81 9\uc131, \u6771\u5317 \u4e5d\u57ce).[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|upright|A mounted [[samurai]] with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet.

The emergence of the [[samurai]] aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging [[lancer]] cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.\n\nAn example is Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac?), a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special \"turnip-headed\" arrows successively at three wooden targets.\n\nThis style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.\nCurrently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.\n\nKasagake or Kasakake (\u7b20\u61f8, \u304b\u3055\u304c\u3051 lit. \"hat shooting\") is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.\n\n===South Asia===\n====India====\nIn the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320\u2013600) period onwards.

The arms and armour for heavy cavalry increased, the high-backed [[saddle]] developed, and [[stirrup]]s and [[spur]]s were added, increasing the advantage of heavy cavalry even more.\n\nThis shift in military importance was reflected in society as well; [[knight]]s took centre stage both on and off the battlefield. These are considered the \"ultimate\" in heavy cavalry: well-equipped with the best weapons, state-of-the-art armour from head to foot, leading with the [[lance]] in battle in a full-gallop, close-formation \"knightly charge\" that might prove irresistible, winning the battle almost as soon as it begun.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century depiction of a riding horse.

While mounted men-at-arms focused on a narrow combat role of shock combat, medieval armies relied on a large variety of foot troops to fulfill all the rest ([[skirmishing]], flank guards, scouting, holding ground, etc.). Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the common soldiers, which led early students of military history to suppose that heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields. But well-trained and disciplined infantry could defeat knights.\n\nMassed [[English longbow]]men triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339),<ref>{{cite book|first=H.W.|last=Koch|page=[https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189 189]|title=Medieval Warfare|ISBN=0-86124-008-1|url=https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189}}</ref> foot-soldiers proved they could resist cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.\n\nThis gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.\n\n==Greater Middle East==\n{{main|Religious war|Muslim conquests}}\n\n===Arabs===\n{{main|Mobile guard|List of battles of Muhammad}}\n[[File:Ikhwan.jpg|thumb|left|Arab [[Camel cavalry|camelry]]]]\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad made use of cavalry in many of his military campaigns including the [[Expedition of Dhu Qarad]],<ref>Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 231.

Its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629 ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army.

This was in contrast to the ''tabinan'' horsemen who were the followers of individual noblemen. Their training and equipment varied widely but they made up the backbone of the Mughal cavalry. Finally there were tribal irregulars led by and loyal to tributary chiefs. These included Hindus, Afghans and Turks summoned for military service when their autonomous leaders were called on by the Imperial government.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicolle|pages=10\u201311|title=Mughul India 1504\u20131761|ISBN=1-85532-344-3}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mughal Troops Chase the Armies of Da'ud.jpg|Akbar leads the [[Mughal Army]] during a campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n==Renaissance Europe==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u20131441).]]\nIronically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the \"golden age\" of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.\n\nKnighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.\n\n[[File:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Polish hussars|Husarz]]'' (Polish Hussar) by [[J\u00f3zef Brandt]].]]\n\nFrom the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace.\n\nThe Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].\n\n==18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars==\n[[File:Battle of Eylau 1807 by Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|left|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on Fort]].]]\n\nCavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nEven with the increasing prominence of infantry, cavalry still had an important place in armies. They often patrolled the fringes of army encampments, with standing orders to intercept and kill suspected shirkers and deserters on sight.<ref name=MattWhite/>{{rp|257, 266}} Cavalry units also served as [[Picket (military)|outpost pickets]] in advance of the main body.

However, in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], repeated [[Battle of Waterloo#The French cavalry attack|charges by up to 9,000 French cavalrymen]] failed to break the line of the British and German infantry, who had formed [[Infantry square|square]]s.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/battle_waterloo_01.shtml#five BBC History: The Battle of Waterloo]</ref>\n\nMassed infantry was deadly to cavalry, but offered an excellent target for [[artillery]]. Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of [[World War I]].\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The charge of the Venezuelan First Division's cavalry at the [[Battle of Carabobo]].]]\n\n===Europe===\nBy the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:\n\n* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry\n* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry\n* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry\n* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s\n\nThere were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs \u00e0 cheval''; Prussia had the ''J\u00e4ger zu Pferd''; Bavaria, Saxony and Austria<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Knotel|pages=24, 182 & 230|title=Uniforms of the World.

The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the [[Australian Light Horse]] served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign.

While employed effectively against their Austro-Hungarian counterparts during the initial offensives across the [[Isonzo River]], the Italian mounted forces ceased to have a significant role as the front shifted into mountainous terrain. By 1916 all cavalry machine-gun sections and two complete cavalry divisions had been dismounted and seconded to the infantry.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Nicolle|pages=34\u201335|title=The Italian Army of World War I|ISBN=1-84176-398-5}}</ref>\n\nSome cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come. [[Tank]]s, introduced on the Western Front by the British in September 1916, had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them. In their first major use at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]], the plan was for a cavalry division to follow behind the tanks, however they were not able to cross a canal because a tank had broken the only bridge.<ref>[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/battle_of_cambrai.htm History Learning Site: Battle of Cambrai]</ref> It was not until the German Army had been forced to retreat in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] of 1918, that cavalry were again able to operate in their intended role.

Their mounted charge succeeded after a [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|coordinated attack]] by the British Infantry and Yeomanry cavalry and the Australian and New Zealand Light Horse and Mounted Rifles brigades. A series of coordinated attacks by these [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] infantry and mounted troops were also successful at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], during which the British infantry divisions and the Desert Mounted Corps drove two Ottoman armies back to the Jaffa\u2014Jerusalem line. The infantry with mainly dismounted cavalry and mounted infantry fought in the [[Judean Hills]] to eventually almost encircle [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem]] which was occupied shortly after.\n\nDuring a pause in operations necessitated by the [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 on the Western Front joint infantry and mounted infantry attacks towards [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Es Salt]] resulted in retreats back to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] which continued to be occupied by mounted divisions during the summer of 1918.\n\nThe Australian Mounted Division was armed with swords and in September, after the successful [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|breaching]] of the Ottoman line on the Mediterranean coast by [[Battle of Sharon (1918)|the British Empire infantry]] XXI Corps was followed by cavalry attacks by the [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|4th Cavalry Division]], [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|5th Cavalry Division]] and [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Australian Mounted Division]]s which almost encircled two Ottoman armies in the Judean Hills [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|forcing their retreat]].

There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.\n\nCavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komar\u00f3w]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.\n[[File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Lithuania]]n lancers training in the 1930s]]\nThe post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nThe [[British Army]] mechanised all cavalry regiments between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.\n\nDuring the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.\n\nThe thirty-nine cavalry regiments of the [[British Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanization began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanized initially, in the majority of cases, to motorized infantry transported in 15cwt trucks.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=382|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}</ref> The last horsed regiment of the British Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its final mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists in the Pakistan Army as an armored regiment.\n\n==World War II==\nWhile most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns. Rather than charge their mounts into battle, cavalry units were either used as mounted infantry (using horses to move into position and then dismounting for combat) or as reconnaissance units (especially in areas not suited to tracked or wheeled vehicles).\n\n===Polish===\n[[File:Polski u\u0142an z karabinem przeciwpancernym UR.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Polish [[uhlan]] with [[wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]]. Military instruction published in [[Warsaw]] in 1938.]]\nA popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zaloga\n | first = S.

However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.<ref name=Davies324>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.<ref name=Davies325>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-054-1525-26, Frankreich, Kavallerie am Ausgang eines Dorfes.jpg|thumb|left|A German cavalry patrol in May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].]]\nA more correct term would be \"mounted infantry\" instead of \"cavalry\", as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, and in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]] included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), the [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapons, anti tank artillery such as the [[Bofors 37 mm]], also light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the [[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d]], when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.\n\nThe last classical cavalry charge of the war took place on March 1, 1945 during the [[Battle of Schoenfeld]] by the 1st \"Warsaw\" Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the \"Warsaw\"s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.\n\n===Greek===\nThe [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanized) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.<ref>''The Armed Forces of World War II 1914\u20131945'', Andrew Mollo, {{ISBN|0-85613-296-9}}</ref>\n\n===Soviet===\nBy the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops. The main usage of Soviet cavalry involved infiltration through front lines with subsequent deep raids, which disorganised German supply lines. Another role was the pursuit of retreating enemy forces during major frontline operations and breakthroughs.\n\n===Italian===\nThe last mounted sabre charge by Italian cavalry occurred on August 24, 1942 at [[Isbuscenskij Charge|Isbuscenski]] (Russia), when a squadron of the Savoia Cavalry Regiment charged the 812th Siberian Infantry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment, together with the Novara Lancers made a dismounted attack in an action that ended with the retreat of the Russians after heavy losses on both sides.<ref>Jeffrey T.

The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Myanmar]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)]], charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.\n\n===Mongolia===\n[[File:Battle of Khalkhin Gol-Mongolian cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Mongolian cavalry in the Khalkhin Gol (1939)]]\n\nIn the early stages of World War II, mounted units of the Mongolian People's Army were involved in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against invading Japanese forces. Soviet forces under the command of Georgy Zhukov, together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars. After the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941, Mongolia remained neutral throughout most of the war, but its geographical situation meant that the country served as a buffer between Japanese forces and the Soviet Union. In addition to keeping around 10% of the population under arms, Mongolia provided half a million trained horses for use by the Soviet Army. In 1945 a partially mounted Soviet-Mongolian [[Cavalry Mechanized Group]] played a supporting role on the western flank of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The last active service seen by cavalry units of the Mongolian Army occurred in 1946\u20131948, during border clashes between Mongolia and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\n==Post\u2013World War II to present day==\n\n[[File:US soldiers on horseback 1991 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] and [[Combat Controller]]s on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]\nWhile most modern \"cavalry\" units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (DF) includes a \"Cavalry Corps\" equipped with armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The DF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort of [[Blue Hussars]] drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.\n\nSome engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahi]]s to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954\u201362). The [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. The [[Portuguese Army]] used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique]] in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Abbott|page=24|title=Modern African Wars (2): Angola and Mozambique|ISBN=0-85045-843-9}}</ref> During the 1964\u201379 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]] period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.\n\nCentral and South American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Asia, Europe, or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid-1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=English|first=Adrian J.|date=May 1985 |title=Armed Forces of Latin America:Their Histories, Development, Present Strength and Military Potential|url= |location= |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|page= |isbn=978-0710603210 |access-date= }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].<ref>Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n===Operational horse cavalry===\nToday the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest existing horse-mounted cavalry unit still having operational potential.<ref>[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703113133/http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html |date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated [[Imperial Service Troops|state cavalry]] squadrons of [[Gwalior]], [[Jodhpur]], and [[Mysore]].

The PLA mounted units last saw action during border clashes with [[Vietnam]] in the 1970s and 80s, after which most cavalry units were disbanded as part of the major military downsizing of the 1980s.\nIn the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there were calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain. Subsequent Chinese media reporting<ref>''Global Times'' 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011</ref> confirms that the Chinese Army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region for scouting and logistical purposes.\n\nThe [[Chilean Army]] still maintains a mixed armoured cavalry regiment, with elements of it acting as mounted mountain exploration troops, based in the city of [[Angol]], being part of the III Mountain Division<ref>[[:es:Regimiento de Caballer\u00eda n.\u00ba 3 \"H\u00fasares\"]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}, and another independent exploration cavalry detachment in the town of [[Chaiten]].

However, neither country retains a horse-mounted unit.\n\nSeveral [[armour|armored]] units of the modern [[United States Army]] retain the designation of \"[[Armored cavalry]]\". The United States also has \"[[Air assault|air cavalry]]\" units equipped with [[helicopter]]s. The Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], made up of active duty soldiers, still functions as an active unit; trained to approximate the weapons, tools, equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s.<ref>[http://pao.hood.army.mil/1stCavDiv/horseDet/default.html First Team!

The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].\n\nEarly light cavalry (like the [[auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliaries of the Roman army]]) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy [[projectile|missile]] troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cataphract]] were used as shock troops\u2014they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term \"battle cavalry\".<ref>p. 490, Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry units still retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes, and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.\n\nSince the development of [[armored warfare]], the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while [[medium tank|medium]] and [[heavy tank]]s are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].\n\n==Social status==\nFrom the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.\n\nFor this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of lightly armed [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasant levies came into conflict, the poorly trained footmen would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.\n\nIn later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the [[line infantry]] regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their [[Royal Guards|royal or imperial guards]]. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards, through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Imperial Guard]] an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.\n\n==On film==\nSome sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', which featured some 2,000 cavalrymen,<ref>{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J.

Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the [[combat arms]]. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''', '''horseman''', '''[[dragoon]]''', or '''[[trooper (rank)|trooper]]'''. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any [[Military animal|military forces that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]], mules or [[War elephant|elephants]]. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.\n\nCavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and [[inertial mass]] over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.\n\nThe speed, mobility, and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the [[Ancient era|Ancient]] and [[Horses in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in [[eurasian nomads|nomadic societies of Asia]], notably the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]] and the later [[Mongol Army|Mongol armies]].<ref>\nJohn Keegan, pages 188-189, ''[[A History of Warfare]],'' {{ISBN|0-09-174527-6}}\n</ref> In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured (heavy)]], and eventually evolving into the mounted [[knight]]s of the medieval period. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.\n\nIn [[Interwar period|the period]] between the [[World Wars]], many cavalry units were converted into [[motorized infantry]] and [[mechanized infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during [[World War II]], notably in the [[Red Army]], the [[Mongolian People's Army]], the [[Royal Italian Army]], the [[Romania in World War II|Romanian Army]], the [[Polish Land Forces]], and light reconnaissance units within the [[Waffen SS]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of [[Surveillance and Target Acquisition|reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition]] (RSTA).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Role of cavalry==\n{{Main|Cavalry tactics}}\n[[File:Rytter fra Bagirmi.jpg|thumb|upright|African horseman of [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] in full [[gambeson|padded armour]] suit]]\n\nIn many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of the disposition of the main body of troops, forward security, offensive [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance by combat]], defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, [[relief in place]], linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the \"[[Armoured warfare|armored]]\" designation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|left|[[Assyrian cavalry]]]]\n\nBefore the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].<ref>p. 1, Menon</ref> The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] from 1550 BC as well as the [[Assyrian army]] and [[Babylonia]]n royalty.<ref>Terrence Wise, p. 18, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nThe power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of [[horse]]s (then mostly small) to carry heavy [[armor]]. Nonetheless, there are indications that, from the 15th century BC onwards, horseback riding was practiced amongst the military elites of the great states of the ancient Near East, most notably those in [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]] <ref> https://www.academia.edu/1532320/Horseback_riding_and_Cavalry_in_Mycenaean_Greece</ref>.\n\nCavalry techniques, and the rise of true cavalry, were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Iranic]] [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sarmatians]].\n[[File:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]\n\nThe photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865\u2013860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the [[mounted archer]] were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.<ref>Terrence Wise, plate H, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 490 BC a [[Nisean horse|breed of large horses]] was bred in the [[Nisaean plain]] in Media to carry [[Cataphract|men with increasing amounts of armour]] (Herodotus 7,40 & 9,20), but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the fourth century BC the Chinese during the [[Warring States period]] (403&ndash;221 BC) began to use cavalry against rival states,<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\">Ebrey and others, ''Pre-Modern East Asia'', pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref> and by 331 BC when [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive [[scythed chariot]]s. The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=164|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\nHowever, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing.\n\nOutside of mainland Europe, the southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the [[Caledonia]]ns at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius|Mons Graupius]], in 84 AD.\n\n===Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===\n[[File:Amphora Louvre F12.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warrior's departure; an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[amphora]] dated 550\u2013540 BC.]]\n{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}\n\nDuring the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with [[javelin]]s, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using [[lance]]s, had the ability to close in on their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the [[hoplites]] or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=37|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nCavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], their first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by [[Phillip II of Macedon]] when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen,<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=18|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=54|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Macedon]]ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]])<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=17|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> of Philip II of Macedon and [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen<ref>{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Sekunda|page=42|title=Macedonian Armies after Alexander 323-168 BC|ISBN=978-1-84908-714-8}}</ref> called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or \"Horserider\"), Greek \"heavy\" cavalry, armed with [[Kontos (weapon)|kontos]] (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet.The Classic Greek/Roman design later inspired the Classic Revival style of helmets worn by cavalry in the War of 1812<ref>https://jefpat.maryland.gov/Pages/mac-lab/curators-choice/2020-curators-choice/jacob-huyett-cavalry-helmet.aspx</ref>. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. The effectiveness of this combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquests of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=14\u201322|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Republic and Early Empire===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n{{main|Roman cavalry}}\n[[File:K\u00f6ln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tombstone of a Roman [[auxilia]]ry trooper from [[History of Cologne|Cologne]], Germany. Second half of the first century AD]]\n\nThe cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''\u2014men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. Horses were provided by the Republic and could be withdrawn if neglected or misused, together with the status of being a cavalryman.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=36|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref>\n\nAs the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the [[Second Punic War]] where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the [[Battle of Cannae]], where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortes Equitatae]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their [[Germanic bodyguard|personal bodyguards]] until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].\n\nFor the most part, Roman cavalry during the early Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the standing force comprising a consular army. Except in times of major mobilisation about 1,800 horsemen were maintained, with three hundred attached to each legion.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=36\u201337|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThe relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].\n\nAfter defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Negin|page=6|title=Roman heavy Cavalry (1) Cataphractarii & Clibanarii, 1st Century BC-5th Century AD.|ISBN=978-1-4728-3004-3}}</ref> \nAt the same time heavy spears and shields modelled on those favoured by the horsemen of the Greek city-states were adopted to replace the lighter weaponry of early Rome.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=38|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThese improvements in tactics and equipment reflected those of a thousand years earlier when the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to undertake similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their [[heavy infantry]] supported by auxiliary cavalry.\n\n===Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period===\n[[File:Roman Cavalry 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reenactor as a Roman [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalryman.]]\n\nIn the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.\n\nThe most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Iranian empires, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]s and their [[Persians|Persian]] [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic period]] with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/ |title=Roman-Persian Wars |work=Historynet.com |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,<ref>The raised rear part of a saddle</ref> was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by [[History of Iran|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.\n\nThe late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders\u2014individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Newark|pages=23\u201324|title=Sabre & Lance.

As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.\n[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders II.jpg|thumb|Mongols at war 14th century]]\n\nThe best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the [[Russian Empire]].

The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].\n\nIn 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\" />\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with saddle and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r 626\u2013649), c 650]]\nThe adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c 1600\u20131050 BC).<ref name=\"ebrey 29\">Ebrey, 29.</ref> By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.<ref name=\"ebrey 30\">Ebrey, 30.</ref> The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the fourth century BC;<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 41\">Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.</ref> it was written by the [[Song dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.<ref name=\"peers 130\">Peers, 130. we can right anything</ref>\n\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in ceremonial armor on horseback, painted by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (1688\u20131766)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], dated 1739 or 1758]]\nOn many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279\u20131368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r 141\u201387 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]\u2013[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.\n\nCavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.<ref name=\"Dien\">[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. \"THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY\"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231319/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup \u2013 history of Chinese science\".

He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders (\ub3d9\ubd81 9\uc131, \u6771\u5317 \u4e5d\u57ce).[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|upright|A mounted [[samurai]] with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet.

The emergence of the [[samurai]] aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging [[lancer]] cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.\n\nAn example is Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac?), a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special \"turnip-headed\" arrows successively at three wooden targets.\n\nThis style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.\nCurrently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.\n\nKasagake or Kasakake (\u7b20\u61f8, \u304b\u3055\u304c\u3051 lit. \"hat shooting\") is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.\n\n===South Asia===\n====India====\nIn the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320\u2013600) period onwards.

The arms and armour for heavy cavalry increased, the high-backed [[saddle]] developed, and [[stirrup]]s and [[spur]]s were added, increasing the advantage of heavy cavalry even more.\n\nThis shift in military importance was reflected in society as well; [[knight]]s took centre stage both on and off the battlefield. These are considered the \"ultimate\" in heavy cavalry: well-equipped with the best weapons, state-of-the-art armour from head to foot, leading with the [[lance]] in battle in a full-gallop, close-formation \"knightly charge\" that might prove irresistible, winning the battle almost as soon as it begun.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century depiction of a riding horse.

While mounted men-at-arms focused on a narrow combat role of shock combat, medieval armies relied on a large variety of foot troops to fulfill all the rest ([[skirmishing]], flank guards, scouting, holding ground, etc.). Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the common soldiers, which led early students of military history to suppose that heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields. But well-trained and disciplined infantry could defeat knights.\n\nMassed [[English longbow]]men triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339),<ref>{{cite book|first=H.W.|last=Koch|page=[https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189 189]|title=Medieval Warfare|ISBN=0-86124-008-1|url=https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189}}</ref> foot-soldiers proved they could resist cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.\n\nThis gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.\n\n==Greater Middle East==\n{{main|Religious war|Muslim conquests}}\n\n===Arabs===\n{{main|Mobile guard|List of battles of Muhammad}}\n[[File:Ikhwan.jpg|thumb|left|Arab [[Camel cavalry|camelry]]]]\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad made use of cavalry in many of his military campaigns including the [[Expedition of Dhu Qarad]],<ref>Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 231.

Its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629 ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army.

This was in contrast to the ''tabinan'' horsemen who were the followers of individual noblemen. Their training and equipment varied widely but they made up the backbone of the Mughal cavalry. Finally there were tribal irregulars led by and loyal to tributary chiefs. These included Hindus, Afghans and Turks summoned for military service when their autonomous leaders were called on by the Imperial government.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicolle|pages=10\u201311|title=Mughul India 1504\u20131761|ISBN=1-85532-344-3}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mughal Troops Chase the Armies of Da'ud.jpg|Akbar leads the [[Mughal Army]] during a campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n==Renaissance Europe==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u20131441).]]\nIronically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the \"golden age\" of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.\n\nKnighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.\n\n[[File:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Polish hussars|Husarz]]'' (Polish Hussar) by [[J\u00f3zef Brandt]].]]\n\nFrom the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace.\n\nThe Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].\n\n==18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars==\n[[File:Battle of Eylau 1807 by Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|left|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on Fort]].]]\n\nCavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nEven with the increasing prominence of infantry, cavalry still had an important place in armies. They often patrolled the fringes of army encampments, with standing orders to intercept and kill suspected shirkers and deserters on sight.<ref name=MattWhite/>{{rp|257, 266}} Cavalry units also served as [[Picket (military)|outpost pickets]] in advance of the main body.

Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of [[World War I]].\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The charge of the Venezuelan First Division's cavalry at the [[Battle of Carabobo]].]]\n\n===Europe===\nBy the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:\n\n* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry\n* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry\n* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry\n* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s\n\nThere were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs \u00e0 cheval''; Prussia had the ''J\u00e4ger zu Pferd''; Bavaria, Saxony and Austria<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Knotel|pages=24, 182 & 230|title=Uniforms of the World.

Following the experience of the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] of 1899\u20131902 (where mounted Boer citizen commandos fighting on foot from cover proved more effective than regular cavalry) the British Army withdrew lances for all but ceremonial purposes and placed a new emphasis on training for dismounted action.

There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.\n\nCavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komar\u00f3w]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.\n[[File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Lithuania]]n lancers training in the 1930s]]\nThe post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nThe [[British Army]] mechanised all cavalry regiments between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.\n\nDuring the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.\n\nThe thirty-nine cavalry regiments of the [[British Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanization began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanized initially, in the majority of cases, to motorized infantry transported in 15cwt trucks.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=382|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}</ref> The last horsed regiment of the British Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its final mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists in the Pakistan Army as an armored regiment.\n\n==World War II==\nWhile most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns. Rather than charge their mounts into battle, cavalry units were either used as mounted infantry (using horses to move into position and then dismounting for combat) or as reconnaissance units (especially in areas not suited to tracked or wheeled vehicles).\n\n===Polish===\n[[File:Polski u\u0142an z karabinem przeciwpancernym UR.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Polish [[uhlan]] with [[wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]]. Military instruction published in [[Warsaw]] in 1938.]]\nA popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zaloga\n | first = S.

First, because motorised vehicles were in short supply, the Poles used horses to pull anti-tank weapons into position.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Time Staff|date=April 22, 1940|number= |title= The New Pictures|journal= Time|volume= |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763905-1,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Second, there were a few incidents when Polish cavalry was trapped by German tanks, and attempted to fight free. However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.<ref name=Davies324>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.<ref name=Davies325>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-054-1525-26, Frankreich, Kavallerie am Ausgang eines Dorfes.jpg|thumb|left|A German cavalry patrol in May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].]]\nA more correct term would be \"mounted infantry\" instead of \"cavalry\", as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, and in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]] included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), the [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapons, anti tank artillery such as the [[Bofors 37 mm]], also light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the [[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d]], when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.\n\nThe last classical cavalry charge of the war took place on March 1, 1945 during the [[Battle of Schoenfeld]] by the 1st \"Warsaw\" Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the \"Warsaw\"s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.\n\n===Greek===\nThe [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanized) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.<ref>''The Armed Forces of World War II 1914\u20131945'', Andrew Mollo, {{ISBN|0-85613-296-9}}</ref>\n\n===Soviet===\nBy the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops. The main usage of Soviet cavalry involved infiltration through front lines with subsequent deep raids, which disorganised German supply lines. Another role was the pursuit of retreating enemy forces during major frontline operations and breakthroughs.\n\n===Italian===\nThe last mounted sabre charge by Italian cavalry occurred on August 24, 1942 at [[Isbuscenskij Charge|Isbuscenski]] (Russia), when a squadron of the Savoia Cavalry Regiment charged the 812th Siberian Infantry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment, together with the Novara Lancers made a dismounted attack in an action that ended with the retreat of the Russians after heavy losses on both sides.<ref>Jeffrey T.

The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Myanmar]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)]], charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.\n\n===Mongolia===\n[[File:Battle of Khalkhin Gol-Mongolian cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Mongolian cavalry in the Khalkhin Gol (1939)]]\n\nIn the early stages of World War II, mounted units of the Mongolian People's Army were involved in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against invading Japanese forces. Soviet forces under the command of Georgy Zhukov, together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars. After the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941, Mongolia remained neutral throughout most of the war, but its geographical situation meant that the country served as a buffer between Japanese forces and the Soviet Union. In addition to keeping around 10% of the population under arms, Mongolia provided half a million trained horses for use by the Soviet Army. In 1945 a partially mounted Soviet-Mongolian [[Cavalry Mechanized Group]] played a supporting role on the western flank of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The last active service seen by cavalry units of the Mongolian Army occurred in 1946\u20131948, during border clashes between Mongolia and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\n==Post\u2013World War II to present day==\n\n[[File:US soldiers on horseback 1991 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] and [[Combat Controller]]s on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]\nWhile most modern \"cavalry\" units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (DF) includes a \"Cavalry Corps\" equipped with armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The DF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort of [[Blue Hussars]] drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.\n\nSome engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahi]]s to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954\u201362). The [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. The [[Portuguese Army]] used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique]] in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Abbott|page=24|title=Modern African Wars (2): Angola and Mozambique|ISBN=0-85045-843-9}}</ref> During the 1964\u201379 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]] period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.\n\nCentral and South American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Asia, Europe, or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid-1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=English|first=Adrian J.|date=May 1985 |title=Armed Forces of Latin America:Their Histories, Development, Present Strength and Military Potential|url= |location= |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|page= |isbn=978-0710603210 |access-date= }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].<ref>Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n===Operational horse cavalry===\nToday the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest existing horse-mounted cavalry unit still having operational potential.<ref>[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703113133/http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html |date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated [[Imperial Service Troops|state cavalry]] squadrons of [[Gwalior]], [[Jodhpur]], and [[Mysore]].

The PLA mounted units last saw action during border clashes with [[Vietnam]] in the 1970s and 80s, after which most cavalry units were disbanded as part of the major military downsizing of the 1980s.\nIn the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there were calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain. Subsequent Chinese media reporting<ref>''Global Times'' 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011</ref> confirms that the Chinese Army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region for scouting and logistical purposes.\n\nThe [[Chilean Army]] still maintains a mixed armoured cavalry regiment, with elements of it acting as mounted mountain exploration troops, based in the city of [[Angol]], being part of the III Mountain Division<ref>[[:es:Regimiento de Caballer\u00eda n.\u00ba 3 \"H\u00fasares\"]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}, and another independent exploration cavalry detachment in the town of [[Chaiten]].

The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].\n\nEarly light cavalry (like the [[auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliaries of the Roman army]]) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy [[projectile|missile]] troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cataphract]] were used as shock troops\u2014they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term \"battle cavalry\".<ref>p. 490, Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry units still retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes, and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.\n\nSince the development of [[armored warfare]], the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while [[medium tank|medium]] and [[heavy tank]]s are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].\n\n==Social status==\nFrom the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.\n\nFor this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of lightly armed [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasant levies came into conflict, the poorly trained footmen would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.\n\nIn later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the [[line infantry]] regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their [[Royal Guards|royal or imperial guards]]. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards, through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Imperial Guard]] an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.\n\n==On film==\nSome sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', which featured some 2,000 cavalrymen,<ref>{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J.
