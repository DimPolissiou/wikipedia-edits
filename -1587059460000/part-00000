The BMW owned Rover Group manufactured the model from 1995 to 2000. BMW broke up Rover Group in 2000, divesting the Rover and MG passenger car businesses to a management buy-out who formed the independent [[MG Rover]] business. MG Rover manufactured the MG F from 2000 onwards, heavily updating it to become the MG TF in 2002. \n\nMG Rover entered administration in 2005, resulting in the production of the MG TF model ceasing. The remains of the MG Rover business were sold to Nanjing Automobile and the MG TF resumed production under the Nanjing owned [[MG Motor]] in 2007. The model, by then heavily outdated, was not a sales success and production ceased for a second and final time in 2011. \n\n==History==\nMG had stopped producing [[sports car]]s in 1980 when [[British Leyland]] closed their [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]] plant, although the badge of MG was used on [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] hatchbacks and saloons between 1982 and 1991. \n\nIn 1992, the company (by this time [[Rover Group]]) restarted production of the classic [[MG MGB|MGB]] as the limited edition [[MG RV8|RV8]], and positive reaction led the company to develop the MG F. During the 1980s, a number of new MG sports cars had been hinted at with the appearance of concept cars at motor shows, but none of these cars ever went into production. \n\nBy 1991, Rover was working on a new mid-engined sports car similar in size (and expected to be similar in price) to the recently launched [[Mazda MX5]] and [[Lotus Elan]]. The final product, the MG F, was finally unveiled on 8 March 1995,<ref>[https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/mg-cars/mgftf/the-cars-mgftf-development-history/]</ref>and went on sale in September that year with a 1.8 litre 120bhp engine, and was joined several months later by a 145bhp VVC (variable valve control) version. It was hugely popular and received plaudits for its excellent ride and handling. The MG F received a mild facelift in August 1999, by which time a high performance Supersport version was reportedly in the pipeline, but this version was never launched; the highest performance MG F model was the 160bhp Trophy model which joined the range a year after the facelift.<ref>[http://www.mgownersclub.co.uk/mg-guides/mgf]</ref>\n\nIt was revised and renamed using the historic ''TF'' name in January 2002, but production was halted, following the collapse of the [[MG Rover Group]] in April 2005. However, after [[Nanjing Automobile Group]] acquired the rights to the MG TF, the completion of the new factory for MG in Nanjing saw production being restarted in March 2007 before finally being stopped in 2011 without an immediate successor.\n\n=={{Anchor}} MG F==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = MG F\n| image = 1999 MG F 1.8 Front.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[MG Cars|MG]] ([[Rover Group]], later [[MG Rover]])\n| production = 1995&ndash;2002\n| class = [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]\n| body_style = 2-seat [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| layout = [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Transverse Mid-Engine, Rear-Wheel Drive]]\n| assembly = [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]], [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]\n| engine = {{ubl | 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Rover K-Series engine|K-Series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1.8&nbsp;L ''K-Series'' I4 | 1.8&nbsp;L ''K-Series'' [[Variable Valve Control|VVC]] I4 }}\n| transmission = 5-Speed ([[Manual transmission{{!}}Manual]])\n}}\n\n===Mark I===\n[[File:1999 MG F 1.8 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|MG F Rear]]\n[[File:MG TF 160 - Flickr - The Car Spy (4).jpg|thumb|right|MG F Mark 2 interior, as also used in the later MG TF]]\nThe MG ''F'' was launched in the autumn of 1995 by the Rover Group, making it the third car to be launched since the takeover by [[BMW]]. It was powered by a 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Rover K-Series engine|K-Series]]'' [[multi-valve|16-valve]] engine, the basic having 118&nbsp;hp (87&nbsp;kW) while the more powerful [[Variable Valve Control|VVC]] (variable valve control) had 143&nbsp;hp (107&nbsp;kW). Although popular across Rover's model range, when fitted to the MGF the K-series engine was plagued by head gasket failure, often attributed to the more complex nature of cooling a mid-engine car, which also made the coolant system prone to developing air pockets around the cylinder head if not properly bled. Rover did little to address this, with owners frequently having to meet the cost of expensive repairs themselves early in the life of their vehicles.\nRover Special Projects oversaw the development of the F's design and before finalising the styling bought-in outside contractors to determine the most appropriate mechanical configuration for the new car. \n\nSteve Harper of [[MGA Developments]] produced the initial design concept in January 1991 (inspired by the [[Jaguar XJR-15]] and the [[Ferrari 250LM]]), before Rover's in house design team refined the concept under the leadership of [[Gerry McGovern]]. An interesting feature of the ''F'' was its [[Hydragas]]  suspension, a system employing interconnected fluid and gas displacers which provided a surprisingly compliant ride but which could be tuned to provide excellent handling characteristics. \n\nThe MG ''F'' quickly shot to the top of the affordable sports car charts in Britain and remained there until the introduction of the MG TF in 2002.\n\n=== Mark II ===\nThe MG ''F'' underwent a facelift in autumn of 1999, and gave the car a revised interior as well as styling tweaks and fresh alloy wheels designs. There was also the introduction of a base 1.6 version and a more powerful 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) variant called the ''Trophy 160'', which had a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 6.9 seconds. The Trophy was only produced for a limited time.\n\nAn automatic version with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] called the ''Steptronic'' was introduced in 2001.<ref name=MK57>{{cite magazine | ref = MK717 | title = Offen, erlich - und g\u00fcnstig |trans-title=Open, honest - and cheap | language = German | page = 57 | date = July 2017 | last = Klauder | first = Kai | magazine = Motor Klassik | publisher = Motor Presse Stuttgart | location = Stuttgart, Germany | issn = 0177-8862 }}</ref> The MG ''F'' continued to sell well in spite of the sale of the Rover Group, which was announced in March 2000. [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], while the MG and Rover marques were sold to the Phoenix consortium for \u00a310. In spite of competition from the likes of [[Mazda MX-5]], [[BMW Z3]] and [[Audi TT]], the MG ''F'' still proved fairly popular. A total of 77,269 MG F's were built.

Based upon the MG F platform, but heavily redesigned and reengineered, the most significant mechanical changes were the abandonment of [[Hydragas]] suspension in favour of conventional coil springs, the new design of the air induction system that along with new camshafts produces more power than in MG F engines, and the torsional stiffness of the body increased by 20%. \n\nVarious cosmetic changes include a revised grille, redesigned front headlights, bumpers, side air-intake grills, rear boot, etc. It held a decent amount of sales despite problems including uneven shut lines on the drivers door on models for the United Kingdom.

The car was designed to accommodate the brand new XP-20 engine used in the MG-Lola EX257 race car with a Garrett turbocharger with an anti-lag system which achieves 500PS. The Power then goes through a 6 Speed sequential gearbox manufactured by X-Trac.\n\nWhen built in 2001, the car was equipped with several upgrades over the standard car. It featured a seam welded bodyshell with a fully integrated T45 roll cage with strengthened subframes. The chassis comes complete with a [[Limited-slip differential]], independent racing suspension and upgraded 4-Pot AP Racing Brakes. The car has 17\" multi-spoke alloy racing wheels with 225/13 R17 tyres on the front, 265/13 R17 tyres on the rear and a bespoke rear wing.\n\nInitially the XPower concept was designed for a brand new wild version of the MG TF, this never came around however and no concept car for a production XPower TF was created. Reportedly the car was set to feature a de-tuned XP-20 engine used in the XPower 500 concept and the MG-Lola race cars with around 300PS but the idea wasn't developed beyond the planning stage.\n\n=== MG TF GT ===\n[[File:MG TF GT Prototype.jpg|thumb|left|MG TF GT Prototype - on display at Hopton Garage, Staffordshire in August 2012]]\n[[File:MG TF GT Prototype - Side View.jpg|thumb|MG TF GT Prototype - side view]]\nDesigned in 2005, at ''Dove in Norfolk'' by Peter Stevens and his team, at the same time as the Rover 75 ''Coup\u00e9'', is the coupe MG TF, called the GT, similar to the [[Pininfarina]] designed [[MG MGB|MGB GT]]. It was unveiled before [[MG Rover Group]] collapsed in April 2005, and was shown at several events such as the [[AutoRAI]] in Amsterdam, alongside other cars such as the [[MG XPower SV]].\n[[File:MG TF GT Prototype - rear view.jpg|thumb|MG TF GT Prototype - rear view]]\nThe concept car was developed from a top of the range TF 160, and came with a grenadine interior (a rare option typically in the top of range TF's), brand new lowered bucket seats, 17\" OZ five spoke wheels, a front splitter to improve aerodynamics and for the first time in a production/factory TF a 2.5L [[Rover KV6 engine|Rover KV6]] engine. It was reported on forums for MG that the engine was changed to a standard 160 [[Rover K engine|VVC 1.8L K Series]] sometime in 2005, although this is disputed and is also disputed as to whether the car received a KV6 in the first place.\n\nWhen launched the car posed several problems. The first of the problems with the coupe is engine access which because the car is a mid rear arrangement posed several problems and made the car hard to work on, it is reported that the subframe had to be removed in order to work on the engine. The second problem is the KV6 powerplant which had to have a bespoke smaller fuel tank to fit in the engine bay as the standard fuel tank wouldn't fit. Although disputed as to whether the car received the KV6 powerplant in the first place it now seems likely however, as ex-MG engineer Chris Flanagan produced his own 2.5 KV6 MGF in 2004 and has subsequently produced further KV6 engined TFs at Retro Sports Cars Ltd in Yorkshire.\n\n\nFormer engineers at MG Rover reported that the car was close to entering production, and as soon as the end of 2005, the car could have been sold. However MG Rover went into receivership, and progress was halted. Nanjing were set to revive the idea and manufacture in the US in a brand new factory in Oklahoma employing 500 people. This idea also never came about with the LE500 and TF135 being the only TF produced by Nanjing at Longbridge, rather than a new purpose built facility in Oklahoma.\n\n==Reception==\nThroughout its production, the MG sold successfully. In a number of road tests, the MG ''F'' impressed, and was a match for its main rivals the Mazda MX-5 and BMW Z3 in terms of handling, performance and practicality, but build quality, reliability and dealer support within the United Kingdom were poor in comparison to its Japanese and German rivals.\n\nHowever, after Nanjiing took over and restarted production, the car's sales plummeted, until production was eventually ceased in March 2011. \n\n''[[Parker's Car Guides|Parker's]]'' gave the car 2.5/5 and said its pros were \"Styling, handling and brand heritage\" and cons were \"Dated interior, patchy build quality and poor reliability.\"\n\n''[[What Car?]]'' gave it 2/5 saying its pros were that it is \"pretty and affordable\" but its cons were \"The driving position and steering are not what you'd expect in such a sporty car.\"\n\n''[[Auto Express]]'' reviewed it after Nanjiing took over, and also had a verdict of 2/5, liking how it was \"well equipped and compact\" but disliking how it was priced more expensive than a basic [[Mazda MX-5]], stating it has \"barely changed since 1995, and can be mistaken for a much older vehicle\" and also commenting on its cramped interior.\n\nThe engine of ''K Series'' used in the MG F has gained a reputation for [[head gasket]] failure. This is mainly due to the design and placement of the thermostat, however the installation of the headgasket was also a major factor. Other factors include insufficient width between the cylinders, build tolerances, block face stiffness, casting quality, gasket material, and cooling system layout (the engine is at the back and the radiator is at the front).\n\nDue to the placement of the thermostat on the intake side of the water pump at the base of the block the head can overheat before sufficient heat is transmitted through the block to allow the thermostat to open. Thermal shock from cooling the block rapidly and the thermostat closing abruptly due to cold water from the radiator cooling the opening spring can result in insufficient coolant reaching as far as the head, which can cause different expansion and contraction rates between the head and the block. \n\nThis combined with the early practice of installing the head gasket with plastic locating dowels, which subsequently melted when the engines overheated, allowed the head gaskets to \"walk.\" A redesigned head gasket, which consists of a multiple layer metal gasket or \"MLS\" used in conjunction with steel locating dowels, is alleged to significantly reduce the chance of a head gasket failure. \n\nThere is no replacement engine that is a suitable replacement for the motor of ''K Series''. Apart from the head gasket problem, MGF and TF models are said to have few major faults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reliabilityindex.co.uk/ |title=Home - Car Reliability Index &#124; Reliability Index &#124; How reliable is your car? |publisher=Reliability Index |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThe engine for the ''K Series'' was sourced from the existing Rover line and was mainly intended as a front engined commuter vehicle power source. The design compromise of locating the thermostat on the pump intake rather than the head outlet originates in this original use. A common aftermarket modification by those who intend to drive their MGFs spiritedly is to install an Inline thermostat in the outlet pipe from the head to the radiator.<ref>http://www.mgfcar.de/thermostat/Water_System_Mods.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgf.ultimatemg.com/group2/common_problems/hgf_pages/cooling_system_modifications.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208073028/http://www.mgf.ultimatemg.com/group2/common_problems/hgf_pages/cooling_system_modifications.htm |archivedate=8 February 2015 }}</ref> This head gasket problem is also found on K series engined [[Lotus Elise]]s and is also commonly solved by thermostat relocation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mgmotor.co.uk/ MG Motor UK]\n* [http://www.mgcc.co.uk/ MG Car Club]\n\n{{MG Motor}}\n{{MG timeline 2000 to date}}\n{{Rover, MG, BL Austin and BL Land Rover vehicles timeline since 1980}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MG F TF}}\n[[Category:MG vehicles|F TF]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Mid-engined cars]]\n[[Category:Roadsters]]\n[[Category:Euro NCAP roadster sports cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1995]]\n", "text_old": ":''For the MG TF Midget of 1953 to 1955, see [[MG T-type]].'' \n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = MG F / MG TF\n| image = MG F (2000) - 14428744349.jpg\n| caption = 2000 MG F\n| production =\n| assembly =\n| manufacturer = [[Rover Group]] (1995\u20132000)<br>[[MG Rover]] (2000\u20132005)<br>[[MG Motor]] (2007\u20132011)| class = [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]\n| body_style = 2-seat [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| layout = [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Transverse Mid-Engine, Rear-Wheel Drive]]\n| engine = \n| transmission =\n| wheelbase = \n| length = \n| width = \n| height = \n| weight = \n| sp = uk\n| related = \n}}\n \nThe '''MG F''' and '''MG TF''' are [[RMR layout|mid-engined, rear wheel drive]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] [[car]]s that were sold under the MG [[marque]] by three manufacturers between 1995 and 2011. \n\nThe MG F was the first new model designed as an MG since the [[MG MGB|MGB]] that was produced from 1962 to 1980, the [[marque]] spent the 1980s being used to denote performance models from then parent [[Austin Rover Group]], and was briefly seen on the [[MG_MGB#MG_RV8|MG RV8]], a limited edition relaunch of the MG MGB which was sold between 1993 and 1995. \n\nThe MG F was initially designed by [[Rover Group]] during the period it was owned by [[British Aerospace]] and was brought to market after the business had been sold to the German car manufacturer [[BMW]]. The BMW owned Rover Group manufactured the model from 1995 to 2000. BMW broke up Rover Group in 2000, divesting the Rover and MG passenger car businesses to a management buy-out who formed the independent [[MG Rover]] business. MG Rover manufactured the MG F from 2000 onwards, heavily updating it to become the MG TF in 2002. \n\nMG Rover entered administration in 2005, resulting in the production of the MG TF model ceasing. The remains of the MG Rover business were sold to Nanjing Automobile and the MG TF resumed production under the Nanjing owned [[MG Motor]] in 2007. The model, by then heavily outdated, was not a sales success and production ceased for a second and final time in 2011. \n\n==History==\nMG had stopped producing [[sports car]]s in 1980 when [[British Leyland]] closed their [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]] plant, although the badge of MG was used on [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] hatchbacks and saloons between 1982 and 1991. \n\nIn 1992, the company (by this time [[Rover Group]]) restarted production of the classic [[MG MGB|MGB]] as the limited edition [[MG RV8|RV8]], and positive reaction led the company to develop the MG F. During the 1980s, a number of new MG sports cars had been hinted at with the appearance of concept cars at motor shows, but none of these cars ever went into production. \n\nBy 1991, Rover was working on a new mid-engined sports car similar in size (and expected to be similar in price) to the recently launched [[Mazda MX5]] and [[Lotus Elan]]. The final product, the MG F, was finally unveiled on 8 March 1995,<ref>[https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/mg-cars/mgftf/the-cars-mgftf-development-history/]</ref>and went on sale in September that year with a 1.8 litre 120bhp engine, and was joined several months later by a 145bhp VVC (variable valve control) version. It was hugely popular and received plaudits for its excellent ride and handling. The MG F received a mild facelift in August 1999, by which time a high performance Supersport version was reportedly in the pipeline, but this version was never launched; the highest performance MG F model was the 160bhp Trophy model which joined the range a year after the facelift.<ref>[http://www.mgownersclub.co.uk/mg-guides/mgf]</ref>\n\nIt was revised and renamed using the historic ''TF'' name in January 2002, but production was halted, following the collapse of the [[MG Rover Group]] in April 2005. However, after [[Nanjing Automobile Group]] acquired the rights to the MG TF, the completion of the new factory for MG in Nanjing saw production being restarted in March 2007 before finally being stopped in 2011 without an immediate successor.\n\n=={{Anchor}} MG F==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = MG F\n| image = 1999 MG F 1.8 Front.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[MG Cars|MG]] ([[Rover Group]], later [[MG Rover]])\n| production = 1995&ndash;2002\n| class = [[Roadster (automobile)|Roadster]]\n| body_style = 2-seat [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| layout = [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Transverse Mid-Engine, Rear-Wheel Drive]]\n| assembly = [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]], [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]\n| engine = {{ubl | 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Rover K-Series engine|K-Series]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1.8&nbsp;L ''K-Series'' I4 | 1.8&nbsp;L ''K-Series'' [[Variable Valve Control|VVC]] I4 }}\n| transmission = 5-Speed ([[Manual transmission{{!}}Manual]])\n}}\n\n===Mark I===\n[[File:1999 MG F 1.8 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|MG F Rear]]\n[[File:MG TF 160 - Flickr - The Car Spy (4).jpg|thumb|right|MG F Mark 2 interior, as also used in the later MG TF]]\nThe MG ''F'' was launched in the autumn of 1995 by the Rover Group, making it the third car to be launched since the takeover by [[BMW]]. It was powered by a 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Rover K-Series engine|K-Series]]'' [[multi-valve|16-valve]] engine, the basic having 118&nbsp;hp (87&nbsp;kW) while the more powerful [[Variable Valve Control|VVC]] (variable valve control) had 143&nbsp;hp (107&nbsp;kW). Although popular across Rover's model range, when fitted to the MGF the K-series engine was plagued by head gasket failure, often attributed to the more complex nature of cooling a mid-engine car, which also made the coolant system prone to developing air pockets around the cylinder head if not properly bled. Rover did little to address this, with owners frequently having to meet the cost of expensive repairs themselves early in the life of their vehicles.\nRover Special Projects oversaw the development of the F's design and before finalising the styling bought-in outside contractors to determine the most appropriate mechanical configuration for the new car. \n\nSteve Harper of [[MGA Developments]] produced the initial design concept in January 1991 (inspired by the [[Jaguar XJR-15]] and the [[Ferrari 250LM]]), before Rover's in house design team refined the concept under the leadership of [[Gerry McGovern]]. An interesting feature of the ''F'' was its [[Hydragas]]  suspension, a system employing interconnected fluid and gas displacers which provided a surprisingly compliant ride but which could be tuned to provide excellent handling characteristics. \n\nThe MG ''F'' quickly shot to the top of the affordable sports car charts in Britain and remained there until the introduction of the MG TF in 2002.\n\n=== Mark II ===\nThe MG ''F'' underwent a facelift in autumn of 1999, and gave the car a revised interior as well as styling tweaks and fresh alloy wheels designs. There was also the introduction of a base 1.6 version and a more powerful 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) variant called the ''Trophy 160'', which had a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 6.9 seconds. The Trophy was only produced for a limited time.\n\nAn automatic version with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] called the ''Steptronic'' was introduced in 2001.<ref name=MK57>{{cite magazine | ref = MK717 | title = Offen, erlich - und g\u00fcnstig |trans-title=Open, honest - and cheap | language = German | page = 57 | date = July 2017 | last = Klauder | first = Kai | magazine = Motor Klassik | publisher = Motor Presse Stuttgart | location = Stuttgart, Germany | issn = 0177-8862 }}</ref> The MG ''F'' continued to sell well in spite of the sale of the Rover Group, which was announced in March 2000.

In spite of competition from the likes of [[Mazda MX-5]], [[BMW Z3]] and [[Audi TT]], the MG ''F'' still proved fairly popular. A total of 77,269 MG F's were built.

Reportedly the car was set to feature a de-tuned XP-20 engine used in the XPower 500 concept and the MG-Lola race cars with around 300PS but the idea wasn't developed beyond the planning stage.\n\n=== MG TF GT ===\n[[File:MG TF GT Prototype.jpg|thumb|left|MG TF GT Prototype - on display at Hopton Garage, Staffordshire in August 2012]]\n[[File:MG TF GT Prototype - Side View.jpg|thumb|MG TF GT Prototype - side view]]\nDesigned in 2005, at ''Dove in Norfolk'' by Peter Stevens and his team, at the same time as the Rover 75 ''Coup\u00e9'', is the coupe MG TF, called the GT, similar to the [[Pininfarina]] designed [[MG MGB|MGB GT]]. It was unveiled before [[MG Rover Group]] collapsed in April 2005, and was shown at several events such as the [[AutoRAI]] in Amsterdam, alongside other cars such as the [[MG XPower SV]].\n[[File:MG TF GT Prototype - rear view.jpg|thumb|MG TF GT Prototype - rear view]]\nThe concept car was developed from a top of the range TF 160, and came with a grenadine interior (a rare option typically in the top of range TF's), brand new lowered bucket seats, 17\" OZ five spoke wheels, a front splitter to improve aerodynamics and for the first time in a production/factory TF a 2.5L [[Rover KV6 engine|Rover KV6]] engine. It was reported on forums for MG that the engine was changed to a standard 160 [[Rover K engine|VVC 1.8L K Series]] sometime in 2005, although this is disputed and is also disputed as to whether the car received a KV6 in the first place.\n\nWhen launched the car posed several problems. The first of the problems with the coupe is engine access which because the car is a mid rear arrangement posed several problems and made the car hard to work on, it is reported that the subframe had to be removed in order to work on the engine. The second problem is the KV6 powerplant which had to have a bespoke smaller fuel tank to fit in the engine bay as the standard fuel tank wouldn't fit. Although disputed as to whether the car received the KV6 powerplant in the first place it now seems likely however, as ex-MG engineer Chris Flanagan produced his own 2.5 KV6 MGF in 2004 and has subsequently produced further KV6 engined TFs at Retro Sports Cars Ltd in Yorkshire.\n\n\nFormer engineers at MG Rover reported that the car was close to entering production, and as soon as the end of 2005, the car could have been sold. However MG Rover went into receivership, and progress was halted. Nanjing were set to revive the idea and manufacture in the US in a brand new factory in Oklahoma employing 500 people. This idea also never came about with the LE500 and TF135 being the only TF produced by Nanjing at Longbridge, rather than a new purpose built facility in Oklahoma.\n\n==Reception==\nThroughout its production, the MG sold successfully. In a number of road tests, the MG ''F'' impressed, and was a match for its main rivals the Mazda MX-5 and BMW Z3 in terms of handling, performance and practicality, but build quality, reliability and dealer support within the United Kingdom were poor in comparison to its Japanese and German rivals.\n\nHowever, after Nanjiing took over and restarted production, the car's sales plummeted, until production was eventually ceased in March 2011. \n\n''[[Parker's Car Guides|Parker's]]'' gave the car 2.5/5 and said its pros were \"Styling, handling and brand heritage\" and cons were \"Dated interior, patchy build quality and poor reliability.\"\n\n''[[What Car?]]'' gave it 2/5 saying its pros were that it is \"pretty and affordable\" but its cons were \"The driving position and steering are not what you'd expect in such a sporty car.\"\n\n''[[Auto Express]]'' reviewed it after Nanjiing took over, and also had a verdict of 2/5, liking how it was \"well equipped and compact\" but disliking how it was priced more expensive than a basic [[Mazda MX-5]], stating it has \"barely changed since 1995, and can be mistaken for a much older vehicle\" and also commenting on its cramped interior.\n\nThe engine of ''K Series'' used in the MG F has gained a reputation for [[head gasket]] failure. This is mainly due to the design and placement of the thermostat, however the installation of the headgasket was also a major factor. Other factors include insufficient width between the cylinders, build tolerances, block face stiffness, casting quality, gasket material, and cooling system layout (the engine is at the back and the radiator is at the front).\n\nDue to the placement of the thermostat on the intake side of the water pump at the base of the block the head can overheat before sufficient heat is transmitted through the block to allow the thermostat to open. Thermal shock from cooling the block rapidly and the thermostat closing abruptly due to cold water from the radiator cooling the opening spring can result in insufficient coolant reaching as far as the head, which can cause different expansion and contraction rates between the head and the block. \n\nThis combined with the early practice of installing the head gasket with plastic locating dowels, which subsequently melted when the engines overheated, allowed the head gaskets to \"walk.\" A redesigned head gasket, which consists of a multiple layer metal gasket or \"MLS\" used in conjunction with steel locating dowels, is alleged to significantly reduce the chance of a head gasket failure. \n\nThere is no replacement engine that is a suitable replacement for the motor of ''K Series''. Apart from the head gasket problem, MGF and TF models are said to have few major faults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reliabilityindex.co.uk/ |title=Home - Car Reliability Index &#124; Reliability Index &#124; How reliable is your car? |publisher=Reliability Index |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThe engine for the ''K Series'' was sourced from the existing Rover line and was mainly intended as a front engined commuter vehicle power source. The design compromise of locating the thermostat on the pump intake rather than the head outlet originates in this original use. A common aftermarket modification by those who intend to drive their MGFs spiritedly is to install an Inline thermostat in the outlet pipe from the head to the radiator.<ref>http://www.mgfcar.de/thermostat/Water_System_Mods.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgf.ultimatemg.com/group2/common_problems/hgf_pages/cooling_system_modifications.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208073028/http://www.mgf.ultimatemg.com/group2/common_problems/hgf_pages/cooling_system_modifications.htm |archivedate=8 February 2015 }}</ref> This head gasket problem is also found on K series engined [[Lotus Elise]]s and is also commonly solved by thermostat relocation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mgmotor.co.uk/ MG Motor UK]\n* [http://www.mgcc.co.uk/ MG Car Club]\n\n{{MG Motor}}\n{{MG timeline 2000 to date}}\n{{Rover, MG, BL Austin and BL Land Rover vehicles timeline since 1980}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MG F TF}}\n[[Category:MG vehicles|F TF]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Mid-engined cars]]\n[[Category:Roadsters]]\n[[Category:Euro NCAP roadster sports cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1995]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.
