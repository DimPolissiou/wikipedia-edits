He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\n\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles 3 times, mixed doubles 2 times, and fives times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the [[Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team|men's team]] title at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Playing style and equipment==\n[[File:Xu Xin 2012.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Xu Xin in the men's final of the Qatar Open 2012]]\nXu Xin is a Stiga sponsored athlete. He uses a Stiga Dynasty Carbon as his blade, with DHS TG2 Skyline national version for his forehand and DHS NEO Hurricane 3 custom sponge on his backhand (37degrees hardness). \n\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as [[Wang Hao (table tennis, born 1983)|Wang Hao]] and [[Ma Lin (table tennis)|Ma Lin]].\n\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold (Chinese) backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\n\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and blazing fast forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer\u2019, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by the use of Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\n\n==Career==\n===2013===\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n\n===2014===\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n\n===2016===\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4\u20132 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked [[Fan Zhendong]] in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] again 4\u20133 in the finals.<ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44790&Competition_ID=2663&</ref><ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44896&Competition_ID=2664&</ref>\n\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===2017===\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sangsu 4\u20130 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4\u20131 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the [[2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2018===\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Lin Gaoyuan]] and [[Yu Ziyang]] in the [[2018 ITTF Team World Cup \u2013 Men's team|2018 ITTF Team World Cup]], beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\n\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the [[2018 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open,]] seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4\u20133, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4\u20131. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the [[2018 German Open (table tennis)|German Open]], Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating [[Lee Sang-su]] and [[Jeoung Young-sik|Jeong Young-sik]] in the final.\n\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the [[2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships]] in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating [[Patrick Franziska]] 3\u20131 for China to claim the title with a 3\u20130 win over Germany.\n\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the [[2018 Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to [[Jang Woo-jin]].\n\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the [[2018 Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]] beating qualifier [[Liu Dingshuo]] in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the [[2018 Bulgaria Open (table tennis)|Bulgaria Open]] beating Japan's [[Kenta Matsudaira]] in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\n\nBecause of his lack of participation in the [[Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament|Asian Cup]] earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the [[2018 ITTF Men's World Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2018 Swedish Open (table tennis)|Swedish Open]], Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the [[2018 Austrian Open (table tennis)|Austrian Open]], Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4\u20133 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4\u20132 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over [[Cheng I-ching|Cheng-I-Ching]] and [[Chen Chien-an]] in the final.\n\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the [[2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4-2. \n\n=== 2019 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nXu Xin started off the year at the [[2019 Hungarian Open (table tennis)|2019 Hungarian Open]] where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion [[Lin Gaoyuan]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open]], Xu Xin faced off against his old rival [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals. \n\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]], Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with [[Liu Shiwen]]. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 [[Fan Zhendong]], #3 [[Lin Gaoyuan]], #9 [[Liang Jingkun]], and #11 [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4-1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4-0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman [[Simon Gauzy]] 4-2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the [[2003 World Table Tennis Championships|2003 World Championships]], where Austria's [[Werner Schlager]] faced off against [[Joo Sae-hyuk|Joo Saehyuk]] in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4-1 over [[Kasumi Ishikawa]] and [[Maharu Yoshimura]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Japan Open (table tennis)|2019 Japan Open]], Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated [[Lin Yun-ju]], \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and [[Zhu Yuling]].\n\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\n\nThe following week at the [[Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It\u2019s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and [[Liu Shiwen]] were defeated by [[Wong Chun Ting]] and [[Doo Hoi Kem]] at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships \u2013 Mixed Doubles|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]].\n\nThe next week at the [[Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]], Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the [[ITTF World Tour]], and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague [[Wang Chuqin]] in the final 4-0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4-0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4-3.\n\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020. \n\nAt the [[Chinese National Championships (table tennis)|2019 Chinese National Championships]], Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Liu Shiwen]], and [[Ding Ning]] all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\n\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\n\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open Xu Xin 05.jpg|thumb|235px|ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open|alt=]]\n\n===ITTF Major tournament performance timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n| style=\"background:lime;\" |W\n| style=\"background:thistle;\" |F\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |#R\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |RR\n|A\n|NH\n|}\n<small>(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semi-finalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (A) Absent; (NH) Not Held; (S) Singles Tournament; (D) Doubles Tournament; (XD) Mixed Doubles Tournament; (T) Team Tournament.</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align::center; font-size: small;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tournament\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Cup\n|S\n|A\n|A\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n|A\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n|A\n|-\n|T\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |World Championships\n|S\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|3R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n|-\n|T\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n|D\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|-\n|XD\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\"|QF\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Tour Grand Finals\n|S\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n|-\n|D\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Olympic Games\n|S\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|-\n|T\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|}\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.ittf.link/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158|title=ITTF Player Matches / Tomokazu Harimoto|website=ITTF|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Singles<ref name=\"ITTF statistics\">[http://ittfstats.alfaweb.gr/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158 ITTF Statistics.] International Table Tennis Federation.</ref>\n*[[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]]: SF (2013, 2017).\n*[[Table Tennis World Cup|World Cup]] appearances: 3.

by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF), as of April 2020.<ref>https://www.ittf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Men-Singles-OR-2020.04.pdf</ref> He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\n\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles 3 times, mixed doubles 2 times, and fives times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the [[Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team|men's team]] title at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Playing style and equipment==\n[[File:Xu Xin 2012.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Xu Xin in the men's final of the Qatar Open 2012]]\nXu Xin is a Stiga sponsored athlete. He uses a Stiga Dynasty Carbon as his blade, with DHS TG2 Skyline national version for his forehand and DHS NEO Hurricane 3 custom sponge on his backhand (37degrees hardness). \n\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as [[Wang Hao (table tennis, born 1983)|Wang Hao]] and [[Ma Lin (table tennis)|Ma Lin]].\n\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold (Chinese) backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\n\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and blazing fast forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer\u2019, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by the use of Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\n\n==Career==\n===2013===\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n\n===2014===\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n\n===2016===\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4\u20132 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked [[Fan Zhendong]] in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] again 4\u20133 in the finals.<ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44790&Competition_ID=2663&</ref><ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44896&Competition_ID=2664&</ref>\n\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===2017===\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sangsu 4\u20130 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4\u20131 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the [[2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2018===\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Lin Gaoyuan]] and [[Yu Ziyang]] in the [[2018 ITTF Team World Cup \u2013 Men's team|2018 ITTF Team World Cup]], beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\n\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the [[2018 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open,]] seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4\u20133, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4\u20131. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the [[2018 German Open (table tennis)|German Open]], Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating [[Lee Sang-su]] and [[Jeoung Young-sik|Jeong Young-sik]] in the final.\n\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the [[2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships]] in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating [[Patrick Franziska]] 3\u20131 for China to claim the title with a 3\u20130 win over Germany.\n\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the [[2018 Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to [[Jang Woo-jin]].\n\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the [[2018 Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]] beating qualifier [[Liu Dingshuo]] in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the [[2018 Bulgaria Open (table tennis)|Bulgaria Open]] beating Japan's [[Kenta Matsudaira]] in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\n\nBecause of his lack of participation in the [[Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament|Asian Cup]] earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the [[2018 ITTF Men's World Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2018 Swedish Open (table tennis)|Swedish Open]], Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the [[2018 Austrian Open (table tennis)|Austrian Open]], Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4\u20133 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4\u20132 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over [[Cheng I-ching|Cheng-I-Ching]] and [[Chen Chien-an]] in the final.\n\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the [[2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4-2. \n\n=== 2019 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nXu Xin started off the year at the [[2019 Hungarian Open (table tennis)|2019 Hungarian Open]] where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion [[Lin Gaoyuan]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open]], Xu Xin faced off against his old rival [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals. \n\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]], Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with [[Liu Shiwen]]. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 [[Fan Zhendong]], #3 [[Lin Gaoyuan]], #9 [[Liang Jingkun]], and #11 [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4-1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4-0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman [[Simon Gauzy]] 4-2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the [[2003 World Table Tennis Championships|2003 World Championships]], where Austria's [[Werner Schlager]] faced off against [[Joo Sae-hyuk|Joo Saehyuk]] in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4-1 over [[Kasumi Ishikawa]] and [[Maharu Yoshimura]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Japan Open (table tennis)|2019 Japan Open]], Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated [[Lin Yun-ju]], \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and [[Zhu Yuling]].\n\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\n\nThe following week at the [[Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It\u2019s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and [[Liu Shiwen]] were defeated by [[Wong Chun Ting]] and [[Doo Hoi Kem]] at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships \u2013 Mixed Doubles|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]].\n\nThe next week at the [[Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]], Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the [[ITTF World Tour]], and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague [[Wang Chuqin]] in the final 4-0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4-0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4-3.\n\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020. \n\nAt the [[Chinese National Championships (table tennis)|2019 Chinese National Championships]], Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Liu Shiwen]], and [[Ding Ning]] all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\n\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\n\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open Xu Xin 05.jpg|thumb|235px|ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open|alt=]]\n\n===ITTF Major tournament performance timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n| style=\"background:lime;\" |W\n| style=\"background:thistle;\" |F\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |#R\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |RR\n|A\n|NH\n|}\n<small>(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semi-finalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (A) Absent; (NH) Not Held; (S) Singles Tournament; (D) Doubles Tournament; (XD) Mixed Doubles Tournament; (T) Team Tournament.</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align::center; font-size: small;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tournament\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Cup\n|S\n|A\n|A\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n|A\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n|A\n|-\n|T\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |World Championships\n|S\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|3R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n|-\n|T\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n|D\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|-\n|XD\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\"|QF\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Tour Grand Finals\n|S\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n|-\n|D\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Olympic Games\n|S\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|-\n|T\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|}\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.ittf.link/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158|title=ITTF Player Matches / Tomokazu Harimoto|website=ITTF|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Singles<ref name=\"ITTF statistics\">[http://ittfstats.alfaweb.gr/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158 ITTF Statistics.] International Table Tennis Federation.</ref>\n*[[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]]: SF (2013, 2017).\n*[[Table Tennis World Cup|World Cup]] appearances: 3.

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom.

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are [[Akzidenz Grotesk|Akzidenz Grotesk Bold]] (English) and [[Hiragino|Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8]] (Japanese).<ref>http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html</ref>\n\n==TV broadcasting==\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = JOEX-TV<br>JOEX-DTV\n| station_logo             = TV Asahi Logo.svg\n| station_slogan           = ''New Air, On Air.''<br>(2008-present)\n| station_branding         = tv asahi<br />\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5<br />''EX''\n| digital                  = JOEX-DTV, Channel 24 ([[UHF]] \u2013 [[Virtual channel|LCN]] 5)\n| other_chs                = '''[[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 45<br />\n'''[[Tama, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 57<br />\n'''[[Chichi-jima|Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Mito, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 36<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Maebashi, Gunma]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />Digital: Channel 43<br />\n'''[[Chichibu, Saitama]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 38<br />\n'''[[Narita, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Tateyama, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Minato Mirai 21|Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka-Kurihama, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 35<br />\n'''[[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 24<br />\n'''[[Kitadait\u014d, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 48<br />\n'''[[Minami Daito, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60\n| affiliations             = [[All-Nippon News Network]]\n| founded                  = {{start date and age|1957}}\n| airdate                  = November 1, 1957\n| location                 = [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d Region, Japan]]\n| callsign_meaning         = JOEX = '''J'''apan's'''O'''riginal Free-to-Air '''E'''ducational TV Station<br>'''X''' (10, former channel assignment)\n| sister_stations          = '''BS Asahi'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 1'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 2'''<br>'''Zee Asahi''' \n| former_callsigns         = \n| owner                    = TV Asahi Corporation\n| former_channel_numbers   = ch.# 10 ([[analog television|analog]], 1957-2011), ch. #5 ([[digital television|digital]])\n| former_affiliations      = \n| effective_radiated_power = 10 kW (68 kW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]])\n| HAAT                     = \n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = \n| coordinates              = {{Coord|35|39|31|N|139|44|44|E|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/\n}}\n\n===Analog===\n\n(until July 24, 2011 only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\n\n'''JOEX-TV''' \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n* [[Tokyo Tower]] \u2013 VHF Channel 10\n;

Haggar founded the Haggar Company in Dallas, Texas in 1926. He personally purchased all materials, supervised production, and handled all sales from a one-room office in the Santa Fe Building. By 1929, Haggar occupied two floors of the building with 250 employees and over the next few years grew to 500 employees, with production of 75,000 pairs of pants annually.<ref name=\"That Haggar Man\">{{cite book|last=Spiegel|first=Joy|title=That Haggar Man|year=1978|isbn=978-0394500454|url=https://archive.org/details/thathaggarmanbio0000spie|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Haggar upgraded its manufacturing methods to mirror Henry Ford's Straight Line Production model of automobile manufacturing. Operators began pants production on a single unit rather than bundles; these units were then passed along by the conveyor to the next operator. Due to the revision of the process, manufacturing costs decreased while productivity increased.\n\nHaggar officially became a national company in 1938, employing a nationwide sales organization and running its first national advertising campaign.\n\nIn 1940, Haggar created the first pre-cuffed pant. The sale of the design led to more growth that allowed the company to move to a new headquarters, including a modern sewing production plant, on Lemmon Avenue in Dallas.\n\nDuring World War II, J.M. Haggar kept factories running 24 hours a day to continuously supply clothing for the U.S. military. By the end of the war, more than 10 million garments had been produced in Haggar factories, and by the end of the decade, Haggar had become the largest producer and marketer of slacks in the world.\n\nIn 1950, Haggar became the first men's apparel brand to advertise on national television with an ad airing on the Today Show.\n\nBy 1971, Haggar had been declared the number one brand of pants in the United States and began manufacturing sport coats, vests, and Haggar \"Custom Fit\" suits, which allowed customers to purchase jackets and pants separately, thus creating a new menswear category: suit separates.<ref name=\"That Haggar Man\"/>\n\nHaggar's innovations reached beyond apparel with their creation of the \"Haggar Hanger\" in 1971, which for the first time allowed retailers to sell pants on hanging fixtures instead of flat folded on tables.  In the 1980s, Haggar became the first in the apparel industry to adopt [[Electronic data interchange|EDI]] quick-response inventory replenishment, and to use UPC codes to ticket merchandise.  In 1987, Haggar invented and received a patent for the \"Size Strip\" sticker, which is used by almost all brands of pants today to identify size and fit on folded bottoms programs.\n\nHaggar introduced 100% cotton \"wrinkle-free\" pants to the market in 1992 and followed with the introduction of moisture-wicking fabrics and pants with a self-adjusting waist in 2003.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, Haggar Clothing Co. entered into an agreement to be acquired by [[Randa Accessories]]. <ref>PRNewswire, May 7, 2019 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/randa-accessories-to-acquire-haggar-clothing-co-300845532.html</ref> The acquisition was completed on May 31, 2019.\n\n==Haggar Hall of Fame Dads\u2122 Campaign==\n\nOn February 1, 2018, Haggar began accepting nominations for its inaugural Haggar Hall of Fame Dads<ref>[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hall-of-fame-jacket-maker-to-honor-americas-dads-with-the-haggar-hall-of-fame-300591779.html], PRNewswire, February 01, 2018</ref> contest via the website [http://www.haggarhofdad.com www.haggarHOFDad.com].

Haggar founded the Haggar Company in Dallas, Texas in 1926. He personally purchased all materials, supervised production, and handled all sales from a one-room office in the Santa Fe Building. By 1929, Haggar occupied two floors of the building with 250 employees and over the next few years grew to 500 employees, with production of 75,000 pairs of pants annually.<ref name=\"That Haggar Man\">{{cite book|last=Spiegel|first=Joy|title=That Haggar Man|year=1978|isbn=978-0394500454|url=https://archive.org/details/thathaggarmanbio0000spie|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Haggar upgraded its manufacturing methods to mirror Henry Ford's Straight Line Production model of automobile manufacturing. Operators began pants production on a single unit rather than bundles; these units were then passed along by the conveyor to the next operator. Due to the revision of the process, manufacturing costs decreased while productivity increased.\n\nHaggar officially became a national company in 1938, employing a nationwide sales organization and running its first national advertising campaign.\n\nIn 1940, Haggar created the first pre-cuffed pant. The sale of the design led to more growth that allowed the company to move to a new headquarters, including a modern sewing production plant, on Lemmon Avenue in Dallas.\n\nDuring World War II, J.M. Haggar kept factories running 24 hours a day to continuously supply clothing for the U.S. military. By the end of the war, more than 10 million garments had been produced in Haggar factories, and by the end of the decade, Haggar had become the largest producer and marketer of slacks in the world.\n\nIn 1950, Haggar became the first men's apparel brand to advertise on national television with an ad airing on the Today Show.\n\nBy 1971, Haggar had been declared the number one brand of pants in the United States and began manufacturing sport coats, vests, and Haggar \"Custom Fit\" suits, which allowed customers to purchase jackets and pants separately, thus creating a new menswear category: suit separates.<ref name=\"That Haggar Man\"/>\n\nHaggar's innovations reached beyond apparel with their creation of the \"Haggar Hanger\" in 1971, which for the first time allowed retailers to sell pants on hanging fixtures instead of flat folded on tables.  In the 1980s, Haggar became the first in the apparel industry to adopt [[Electronic data interchange|EDI]] quick-response inventory replenishment, and to use UPC codes to ticket merchandise.  In 1987, Haggar invented and received a patent for the \"Size Strip\" sticker, which is used by almost all brands of pants today to identify size and fit on folded bottoms programs.\n\nHaggar introduced 100% cotton \"wrinkle-free\" pants to the market in 1992 and followed with the introduction of moisture-wicking fabrics and pants with a self-adjusting waist in 2003.\n\nOn May 7, 2019, Haggar Clothing Co. entered into an agreement to be acquired by [[Randa Accessories]]. <ref>PRNewswire, May 7, 2019 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/randa-accessories-to-acquire-haggar-clothing-co-300845532.html</ref> The acquisition was completed on May 31, 2019.\n\n==Haggar Hall of Fame Dads\u2122 Campaign==\n\nOn February 1, 2018, Haggar began accepting nominations for its inaugural Haggar Hall of Fame Dads<ref>[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hall-of-fame-jacket-maker-to-honor-americas-dads-with-the-haggar-hall-of-fame-300591779.html], PRNewswire, February 01, 2018</ref> contest via the website [http://www.haggarhofdad.com www.haggarHOFDad.com].

To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].

Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony.

He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]]. This returned to public view Robespierre\u2019s only surviving contemporary sculpted portrait. A plaster cast of it is displayed at the Conciergerie in Paris, and a bronze cast is in the Place de la R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise in [[Montpellier]], with bronzes of other figures of the time.<ref>See Nella Buscot, sculpteur, ''Sculptures \u00e0 Montpellier'': http://www.nella-buscot.com/jardins_montpellier_prf_2.php</ref>\n\n==== Resistance units ====\nIn the Second World War, several Resistance groups took his name: the Robespierre Company in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], commanded by Lieutenant Aurin, alias Mar\u00e9chal; the Robespierre Batallion in the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], under Captain Laplace; and a [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]] formed by Marcel Claeys in the [[Ain]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources (selection)==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Andress |first1=David |title=The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France |date=2006 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |isbn=978-0374273415 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDfxQDcQzJ0C |language=en |ref=harv}}\n* Aulard, Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse (1897).
