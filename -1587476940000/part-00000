Despite the knee ailments and the resulting lack of speed, he remained a powerful hitter, picking up 166 hits in 1988.\n\nBaines holds the record for the most seasons by a player between 100-RBI seasons, with 14 seasons between 113 RBIs for Chicago in 1985 and 103 for Baltimore and Cleveland in 1999.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|title=TheSABR Baseball List & Record Book \u2013 Baseball's Most Fascinating Records and Unusual Statistics|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=United States|isbn=9781416532453|page=496}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harold baines2001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Baines before a 2001 game]]\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = SoxRetired03.PNG\n|Name   = Baines\n|Number = 3\n|Team   = Chicago White Sox\n|Year   = 1989\n|}}\nMidway through the 1989 season, the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] acquired Baines, along with [[Fred Manrique]], from the White Sox in a much-derided trade which sent [[Wilson \u00c1lvarez]], [[Scott Fletcher (baseball)|Scott Fletcher]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] to Chicago. After the trade, the White Sox retired Baines' #3 on August 20, 1989, a rare occurrence for a player who was still active in the major leagues (the number would be \"un-retired\" each time Baines returned to the White Sox, and he wore it as a coach).\n\nIn 1990 Baines was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for minor league pitchers [[Scott Chiamparino]] and [[Joe Bitker]], and he helped them reach the postseason only to be swept by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in the [[1990 World Series|World Series]].

Baines batted .313, .294 and .299 over his first three seasons with Baltimore. He returned to the White Sox as a [[free agent]] in 1996 but was traded back to Baltimore midway through the 1997 season; he helped the Orioles reach the playoffs, losing to the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the League Championship Series.\n\nBaines represented the Orioles in the 1999 All Star Game before being traded to the Cleveland Indians later that year.  Baines was signed again for a third stint with his hometown team prior to the 2000 season. Baines was traded by Baltimore with catcher [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]] to Chicago in exchange for Miguel Felix, Juan Figueroa, [[Brook Fordyce]] and Jason Lakman on July 29, 2000.\n\nHis final contract with the White Sox was not renewed following the 2001 season, after his third stint with the team. He finished his career with 2,866 hits, 384 home runs and 1,628 RBIs. His career RBI total is 34th all-time (through 2019); prior to his induction, he had the ninth highest RBI count among retired players not elected in the Hall of Fame; his hit total ranks 46st all-time (through 2019).\n\n===Coaching career===\nBaines' fourth stint with the Chicago White Sox began when he was named [[Coach (baseball)#Bench coach|bench coach]] in March 2004 under new manager [[Ozzie Guill\u00e9n]], his White Sox teammate, from 1985 to 1989 and in 1996\u201397.
