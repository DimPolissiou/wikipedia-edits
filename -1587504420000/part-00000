Through the research of Anspach and others, much of the early history of the game was \"rediscovered\" and entered into official United States court records. Because of the lengthy court process, including appeals, the legal status of Parker Brothers' copyright and trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985. The game's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers, as do its specific design elements; other elements of the game are still protected under copyright law. At the conclusion of the court case, the game's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger ''Monopoly'' brand, licensed by Parker Brothers' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day.

In 2009, Winning Moves Games introduced \"The Classic Edition\", with a pre-2008 game board and cards, re-inclusion of the \"[[sack of money]]\" playing piece, and a plain MONOPOLY logo in the center of the board, with neither the 1985 or 2008 version of \"Mr. Monopoly\" present.<ref>[http://winning-moves.com/product/MonopolyClassic.asp Winning Moves'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508193026/http://winning-moves.com/product/MonopolyClassic.asp |date=2013-05-08 }} ''Monopoly: The Classic Edition'' page</ref> Also in 2009, ''Monopoly'' \"theme packs\" entered the retail market, including the Dog Lovers and Sports Fans editions, which include customized money, replacements for houses and hotels, and custom tokens, but no board.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn early 2010, Hasbro began selling the ''Free Parking'' and ''Get out of Jail'' add-on games, which can be played alone or when a player lands on the respective ''Monopoly'' board spaces.

The first European Championship was held in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]], the same site as the 1972 World Chess Championship. Accounts differ as to the eventual winner: Philip Orbanes and Victor Watson<ref>Interview with Victor Watson for \"Under the Boardwalk\", 5/23/2009</ref> name John Mair, representing Ireland and the eventual World ''Monopoly'' Champion of 1975, as also having won the European Championship.<ref>Orbanes.

According to Parker Brothers' Randolph \"Ranny\" P. Barton,<ref>Interview with Randolph P. Barton for \"Under the Boardwalk\", 7/28/2008</ref> an error was made by one of the participants and a protest was filed by an opponent. The judges (Barton, Watson, and a representative from [[Miro Company|Miro]], the French publishers of Monopoly) weighed the options of starting the final game over and delaying the chartered plane that would take them home from Iceland vs allowing the game to stand with the error but allowing them to make their flight. In the end, the judges upheld the result of the game with the error uncorrected.\n\nVictor Watson and Ranny Barton began holding tournaments in the UK and US, respectively. World Champions were declared in the United States in 1973 and 1974 (and are still considered official World Champions by Hasbro). While the 1973 tournament, the first, matched three United States regional champions against the UK champion and thus could be argued as the first international tournament, true multinational international tournaments were first held in 1975.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 116.</ref> Both authors (Orbanes and Brandreth) agree that John Mair was the first true World Champion, as decided in tournament play held in [[Washington, D.C.]] days after the conclusion of the European Championship (which Mair had also won), in November 1975.<ref>{{cite book| last=Watson| first=Victor| title=The Waddingtons Story | page=85}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982, tournaments in the United States featured a competition between tournament winners in all 50 states, competing to become the United States Champion. National tournaments were held in the US and UK the year before World Championships through 2003\u20132004 but during the same year as of 2009 (see table, below). The determination of the US champion was changed for the 2003 tournament: winners of an [[Internet]]-based quiz challenge were selected to compete, rather than one state champion for each of the 50 states.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 155.</ref> The tournaments are now typically held every six years. In the past, the US edition Monopoly board was used at the World championship level, while national variants are used at the national level.<ref>Brandreth. Page 187.</ref> Since true international play began in 1975, no World champion has come from the US, still considered the board game's \"birthplace\". However, Dana Terman, two-time US Champion, placed second at the 1980 World Championship, Richard Marinaccio, the 2009 US Champion, placed third at the 2009 World Championship, and Brian Valentine, the 2015 US Representative, placed third at the 2015 World Championship.\n\nNicol\u00f2 Falcone of Italy defeated players from 27 countries plus the defending champion in the 2015 World Championship held at The Venetian resort in [[Macau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monopolydocumentary.com/tournaments.htm|title=Under the Boardwalk: The MONOPOLY Story -- 2015 MONOPOLY Championship Info|author=Under the Boardwalk, LLC|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monopolychamps.com/|title=Home - 2015 U.S. Monopoly Game Quiz|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|-\n!

Among other things, Anspach discovered the empty 1933 Charles B. Darrow file at the United States Copyright Office, testimony from the ''Inflation'' game case that was settled out of court, and letters from Knapp Electric challenging Parker Brothers over ''Monopoly''. As the case went to trial in November 1976, Anspach produced testimony by many involved with the early development of the game, including Catherine and Willard Allphin, Dorothea Raiford and Charles Todd. Willard Allphin attempted to sell a version of the game to [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1931, and published an article about the game's early history in the UK in 1975.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 121.</ref> Raiford had helped Ruth Hoskins produce the early Atlantic City games.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 122.</ref> Even Daniel Layman was interviewed, and Darrow's widow was deposed.<ref>Anspach, ''The Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle'', pages 104\u2013106 and pages 134\u2013135.</ref><ref>[http://landlordsgame.info/articles/Anspach-Collection-Description.pdf The Anspach Archives Collection] description.

By 1933, a board game had been created much like the modern version of ''Monopoly'' sold by [[Parker Brothers]] and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the midwestern United States and near the East Coast of the United States, contributed to the game's design and evolution.\n\nBy the 1970s, the idea that the game had been created solely by [[Charles Darrow]] had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's instructions for many years,<ref>[http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Monopoly_(1999).pdf Monopoly Instructions] from a 1999 edition, at hasbro.com</ref> in a 1974 book devoted to ''Monopoly'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Maxine |title=The Monopoly Book: Strategy and Tactics of the World's Most Popular Game |publisher=David McKay Company, Inc. |year=1974 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/14 14\u201320] |isbn=0-679-20292-7 |edition=Fourth Printing, December 1974 |url=https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/14 }}</ref> and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007.<ref name=\"BoardGameStudies\">{{cite journal |last1=Albertarelli |first1=Spartaco |year=2000 |title=1000s Ways to Play Monopoly |journal=Board Games Studies |issue=3 |pages=117\u2013121 |publisher=Research School CNWS, Leiden University, The Netherlands |url=http://www.boardgamestudies.info/pdf/issue3/BGS3-complete.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627054046/http://www.boardgamestudies.info/pdf/issue3/BGS3-complete.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Wallace | first1=David | last2=Wexler | first2=Bruce | title=The Illustrated Directory of Toys | publisher=Colin Gower Enterprises Ltd. | year=2007|page=463|isbn=0-681-63614-9}}</ref> Even a guide to family games published for ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and none to Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by [[Parker Brothers]].<ref>{{cite book | last1=Glenn |first1=Jim |last2=Denton |first2=Carey |title=The Treasury of Family Games |publisher=Amber Books Ltd. |year=2003 |page=15 |isbn=0-7621-0431-7}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the 1970s, Professor [[Ralph Anspach]], who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and [[trust busting]], fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company, [[General Mills]], over the copyright and trademarks of the ''Monopoly'' board game. Through the research of Anspach and others, much of the early history of the game was \"rediscovered\" and entered into official United States court records. Because of the lengthy court process, including appeals, the legal status of Parker Brothers' copyright and trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985. The game's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers, as do its specific design elements; other elements of the game are still protected under copyright law. At the conclusion of the court case, the game's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger ''Monopoly'' brand, licensed by Parker Brothers' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day. Despite the \"rediscovery\" of the board game's early history in the 1970s and 1980s, and several books and journal articles on the subject, [[Hasbro]] (which became Parker Brothers' parent company) did not acknowledge any of the game's history before Charles Darrow on its official ''Monopoly'' website as recently as June 2012,<ref name=\"Hasbro_com2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |title=Monopoly \u2013 History & Fun Facts |publisher=Hasbro |accessdate=4 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614141058/http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |archivedate=June 14, 2012 }}</ref> nor did they acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them, at least as recently as 2009.<ref name=\"wsj_anti\">{{cite news |title=How a Fight Over a Board Game Monopolized an Economist's Life |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |first=Mary |last=Pilon |authorlink=Mary Pilon |date=October 20, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125599860004295449?mod=rss_US_News |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nInternational tournaments, first held in the early 1970s, continue to the present, although the last national tournaments and world championship were held in 2009.

In 2009, Winning Moves Games introduced \"The Classic Edition\", with a pre-2008 game board and cards, re-inclusion of the \"[[sack of money]]\" playing piece, and a plain MONOPOLY logo in the center of the board, with neither the 1985 or 2008 version of \"Mr. Monopoly\" present.<ref>[http://winning-moves.com/product/MonopolyClassic.asp Winning Moves'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508193026/http://winning-moves.com/product/MonopolyClassic.asp |date=2013-05-08 }} ''Monopoly: The Classic Edition'' page</ref> Also in 2009, ''Monopoly'' \"theme packs\" entered the retail market, including the Dog Lovers and Sports Fans editions, which include customized money, replacements for houses and hotels, and custom tokens, but no board.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn early 2010, Hasbro began selling the ''Free Parking'' and ''Get out of Jail'' add-on games, which can be played alone or when a player lands on the respective ''Monopoly'' board spaces.

According to Parker Brothers' Randolph \"Ranny\" P. Barton,<ref>Interview with Randolph P. Barton for \"Under the Boardwalk\", 7/28/2008</ref> an error was made by one of the participants and a protest was filed by an opponent. The judges (Barton, Watson, and a representative from [[Miro Company|Miro]], the French publishers of Monopoly) weighed the options of starting the final game over and delaying the chartered plane that would take them home from Iceland vs allowing the game to stand with the error but allowing them to make their flight. In the end, the judges upheld the result of the game with the error uncorrected.\n\nVictor Watson and Ranny Barton began holding tournaments in the UK and US, respectively. World Champions were declared in the United States in 1973 and 1974 (and are still considered official World Champions by Hasbro). While the 1973 tournament, the first, matched three United States regional champions against the UK champion and thus could be argued as the first international tournament, true multinational international tournaments were first held in 1975.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 116.</ref> Both authors (Orbanes and Brandreth) agree that John Mair was the first true World Champion, as decided in tournament play held in [[Washington, D.C.]] days after the conclusion of the European Championship (which Mair had also won), in November 1975.<ref>{{cite book| last=Watson| first=Victor| title=The Waddingtons Story | page=85}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982, tournaments in the United States featured a competition between tournament winners in all 50 states, competing to become the United States Champion. National tournaments were held in the US and UK the year before World Championships through 2003\u20132004 but during the same year as of 2009 (see table, below). The determination of the US champion was changed for the 2003 tournament: winners of an [[Internet]]-based quiz challenge were selected to compete, rather than one state champion for each of the 50 states.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 155.</ref> The tournaments are now typically held every six years. In the past, the US edition Monopoly board was used at the World championship level, while national variants are used at the national level.<ref>Brandreth. Page 187.</ref> Since true international play began in 1975, no World champion has come from the US, still considered the board game's \"birthplace\".

Among other things, Anspach discovered the empty 1933 Charles B. Darrow file at the United States Copyright Office, testimony from the ''Inflation'' game case that was settled out of court, and letters from Knapp Electric challenging Parker Brothers over ''Monopoly''. As the case went to trial in November 1976, Anspach produced testimony by many involved with the early development of the game, including Catherine and Willard Allphin, Dorothea Raiford and Charles Todd. Willard Allphin attempted to sell a version of the game to [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1931, and published an article about the game's early history in the UK in 1975.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 121.</ref> Raiford had helped Ruth Hoskins produce the early Atlantic City games.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game'', page 122.</ref> Even Daniel Layman was interviewed, and Darrow's widow was deposed.<ref>Anspach, ''The Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle'', pages 104\u2013106 and pages 134\u2013135.</ref><ref>[http://landlordsgame.info/articles/Anspach-Collection-Description.pdf The Anspach Archives Collection] description.

The notable Hawaiian musician [[Moe Keale]] was his uncle and a major musical influence. He was raised in the community of [[Kaimuki]], where his parents had met and married.

A part of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]], the band's blend of contemporary and traditional styles gained in popularity as they toured Hawaii and the continental United States, releasing fifteen successful albums. Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's aim was to make music that stayed true to the typical sound of traditional Hawaiian music. During that time period, the songs that many people associated with Hawaii, typically, were not traditional-sounding songs.\n\n== Music career ==\nThe Makaha Sons of Ni\u02bbihau recorded ''No Kristo'' in 1976 and released four more albums, including ''Kahea O Keale'', ''Keala'', ''Makaha Sons of Ni\u02bbihau'' and ''Mahalo Ke Akua''. In 1982, Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's brother, Skippy, died at age 28 of a heart attack<ref name=\"Kekoa\"/> related to obesity. In that same year, Kamakawiwo\u02bbole married his childhood sweetheart Marlene. Soon after, they had a daughter whom they named Ceslieanne \"Wehi\" (born in {{Circa|1983}}).\n\nThe group became Hawaii's most popular contemporary traditional group with breakout albums 1984's ''Puana Hou Me Ke Aloha'' and its follow-up, 1986's ''Ho\u02bbola''. Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's last recorded album with the group was 1991's ''Ho\u02bboluana''. It remains the group's top-selling CD.\n\nIn 1990, Kamakawiwo\u02bbole released his first solo album ''[[Ka \u02bbAno\u02bbi]]'', which won awards for Contemporary Album of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year from the [[Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts|Hawai\u02bbi Academy of Recording Arts]] (HARA). ''[[Facing Future]]'' was released in 1993 by [[The Mountain Apple Company]].

The notable Hawaiian musician [[Moe Keale]] was his uncle and a major musical influence. He was raised in the community of [[Kaimuki]], where his parents had met and married. He began playing music with his older brother Skippy and cousin Allen Thornton at the age of 11, being exposed to the music of Hawaiian entertainers of the time such as [[Peter Moon (musician)|Peter Moon]], Palani Vaughn and [[Don Ho]], who frequented the establishment where Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's parents worked.

A part of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]], the band's blend of contemporary and traditional styles gained in popularity as they toured Hawaii and the continental United States, releasing fifteen successful albums. Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's aim was to make music that stayed true to the typical sound of traditional Hawaiian music. During that time period, the songs that many people associated with Hawaii, typically, were not traditional-sounding songs.\n\n== Music career ==\nThe Makaha Sons of Ni\u02bbihau recorded ''No Kristo'' in 1976 and released four more albums, including ''Kahea O Keale'', ''Keala'', ''Makaha Sons of Ni\u02bbihau'' and ''Mahalo Ke Akua''. In 1982, Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's brother, Skippy, died at age 28 of a heart attack<ref name=\"Kekoa\"/> related to obesity. In that same year, Kamakawiwo\u02bbole married his childhood sweetheart Marlene. Soon after, they had a daughter whom they named Ceslieanne \"Wehi\" (born in {{Circa|1983}}).\n\nThe group became Hawaii's most popular contemporary traditional group with breakout albums 1984's ''Puana Hou Me Ke Aloha'' and its follow-up, 1986's ''Ho\u02bbola''. Kamakawiwo\u02bbole's last recorded album with the group was 1991's ''Ho\u02bboluana''. It remains the group's top-selling CD.\n\nIn 1990, Kamakawiwo\u02bbole released his first solo album ''[[Ka \u02bbAno\u02bbi]]'', which won awards for Contemporary Album of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year from the [[Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts|Hawai\u02bbi Academy of Recording Arts]] (HARA). ''[[Facing Future]]'' was released in 1993 by [[The Mountain Apple Company]]. It featured a version of his most popular song, the medley \"[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World]]\" (listed as \"Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\"), along with \"Hawai\u02bbi 78\", \"White Sandy Beach of Hawai\u02bbi\", \"Maui Hawaiian Sup'pa Man\", and \"Kaulana Kawaihae\".

It aired in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on October 4, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter watching the movie ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'' at school, the children realize that [[Bart Simpsons|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] smell badly and they start teasing them about it. The same thing happens to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] at the nuclear plant, with Homer realizing (belatedly and angrily) that this is what people were referring to when they called him \"Stink-son.\" [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] then discovers that the smell is coming from their clothes because their [[washing machine]] is old and covered in [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]. She then gives Homer a bag full of money (derived from [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]'s body, which has been in their basement since the events of \"[[Simpsorama]]\") so they can buy a new washing machine. On his way to the store, Homer smells something delicious and discovers a roadside [[barbecue]] stand run by an old biker. When Homer eats the best BBQ he's ever had, the biker reveals that the secret is that the smoker was made from a [[meteorite]] with a unique beehive shape that has trapped all of the fat and sauce from every grilling ever. Homer weighs up whether to do what he should do (buy the washer) or what everyone knows he will; he passes up the washing machine to buy the smoker for himself.\n\nMarge gets upset that Homer spent all their money on a \"grill\" but forgives him and joins the family for a barbecue when she eats the food herself (Lisa eats a barbecued [[carrot]]). The aroma draws people from all over [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] to the Simpsons' backyard to feast on savory cuts of meat. Eventually, Homer's grill becomes so popular that \"Chew Network\" chef, Scotty Boom, shows up and contemptuously challenges him to a smoke-off.\n\nWhilst preparing [[Smoked meat|smoked pork]] to take to the competition, Homer discovers that his smoker has been stolen. He calls the police, but [[Clancy Wiggum|Clancy]] and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]] convince Homer that his smoker is gone and will never be found. However, Bart and Lisa decide to investigate the crime themselves when they notice Homer is so distraught over the theft that he is even refusing to get drunk. They investigate the yard and discover that the thief gave [[Santa's Little Helper]] a jar of natural [[peanut butter]] to distract him, so he would not bark. The duo then proceed to the one store in town that sells natural peanut butter, where they use some violence to \"convince\" a worker to let them see the [[CCTV|security camera footage]], which shows [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] purchasing the peanut butter.\n\nBart and Lisa go talk to Nelson in a park, where he's playing a [[tablet computer|tablet]] game called \"[[Clash of Clans|Clash of Castles]]\" with some expensive [[Glossary of video game terms#In-app purchase|upgrades]]. Nelson is reticent and runs towards a scrap yard to meet someone shortly afterwards, where the duo observe him being paid and revealing the smoker under some trees. Nelson leaves the smoker behind, but it's too hot for Bart and Lisa to walk it back and it ends up being loaded onto the truck and driven away.\n\nHomer, Bart, Lisa and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] give up hope on the competition, but Marge convinces them that she can handle the smoke-off with the help of a rented spice rack. At the competition, hosted by [[Alton Brown]], Marge does her best against Scotty Boom but fails miserably because she used all of the spices together. However, when Scotty presents his meat, it is discovered that the hive shaped grill marks on it do not match his normal grill and he is accused of cheating. Scotty is fired from the \"Chew Network,\" banned from the competition, and arrested by Chief Wiggum. The Simpsons are then proclaimed winners.\n\nThis does not fully satisfy Bart and Lisa, who try to find out why the smoker was stolen on the first place. Soon, they hear the same cellphone ringtone they heard when Nelson was delivering the smoker and so they decide to chase the phone's owner down. When they catch him up, they discover that he is Scotty's son, Tyler Boom, who framed his father because he was too busy with his TV show and didn't spend any time with his family. Tyler explains that he met Nelson playing \"Clash of Castles\" and hired him to steal Homer's smoker in order to frame him. Scotty and Tyler soon reconcile, everything is cleared up with the authorities and Tyler gives Homer's smoker back.\n\nDuring the end credits, several scenes show the future of the Hive Smoker, starting with the Simpsons trading it to Nelson for a new washing machine, and ending with alien bee people taking the hive back into space.\n\n==Reception==\nThe episode received a 2.7 rating and was watched by a total of 6.02 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/10/06/sunday-final-ratings-blood-oil-simpsons-adjusted-up-madam-secretary-adjusted-down/476816/|title=Sunday final ratings: 'Blood & Oil,' 'The Simpsons' adjusted up, 'Madam Secretary' adjusted down|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=October 5, 2015|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDennis Perkins of ''[[The A.V.
