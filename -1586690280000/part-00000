Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \"14-Part Message\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington.

In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\" Of this, Iguchi said, \"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations&nbsp;... and they clearly prevailed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/pearl-harbor-truly-a-sneak-attack-papers-show.html |title=Pearl Harbor Truly a Sneak Attack, Papers Show |author=Howard W.

The Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their [[Japanese Canadian|Japanese-Canadian]] descendants. Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack, leading to a reaction from the [[Government of Canada]]. On February 24, 1942, Order-in-Council P.C. no. 1486 was passed under the [[War Measures Act]], allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia, as well as the prohibiting them from returning to the province.

The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's pistol, maps, codes, and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013294</ref>\n\n===Strategic implications===\nAdmiral [[Ch\u016bichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"<ref>Haufler, Herve.

Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted \"[[Plan Dog]]\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines\u2014the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.

As early as 1924, Chief of U.S. Air Service [[Mason Patrick]] displayed a concern for military vulnerabilities in the Pacific, having sent Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] on a survey of the Pacific and the East.

The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war, including vehicles and landing craft. Both of its torpedoes were missing. This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|St. Louis|CL-49|2}} at 10:04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor, and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer {{USS|Helm|DD-388|2}} at 08:21.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zimm|2011|pp=330\u2013341}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese declaration of war===\n{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}\nThe attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan, but this was not Admiral Yamamoto's intention.

Tokyo transmitted the 5000-word notification (commonly called the \"14-Part Message\") in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule; in the event, it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began. (In fact, U.S. code breakers had [[Purple cipher|already deciphered]] and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it.)<ref>Toland, ''Infamy''</ref> The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war. While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated<ref>Prange, Goldstein, and Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept'', pp. 424 and 475</ref> and that war might break out at any moment,<ref>Prange, Goldstein, and Dillon, ''At Dawn We Slept'', pp. 493\u2013494</ref> it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations.

In 1999, however, Takeo Iguchi, a professor of law and international relations at [[International Christian University]] in Tokyo, discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, and indeed whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off negotiations and start a war, including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying, \"[O]ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.\" Of this, Iguchi said, \"The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations&nbsp;... and they clearly prevailed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/world/pearl-harbor-truly-a-sneak-attack-papers-show.html |title=Pearl Harbor Truly a Sneak Attack, Papers Show |author=Howard W.

The Canadian province of [[British Columbia]], bordering the Pacific Ocean, had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their [[Japanese Canadian|Japanese-Canadian]] descendants.

The island of [[Niihau]], only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor, was designated as the rescue point.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of ''Hiryu'' was damaged in the attack on Wheeler, so he flew to the rescue point. The aircraft was further damaged on landing. Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians, who, aware of the tension between the United States and Japan, took the pilot's pistol, maps, codes, and other documents. The island's residents had no telephones or radios and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese-American residents in an attempt to recover the documents. During the ensuing struggles, Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded; one collaborator committed suicide, and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to Nishikaichi's assistance was a source of concern for many, and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted.<ref>Douglas Shinsato, Translator/Publisher of For That One Day: The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, 2011, pp.&nbsp;293\u2013294</ref>\n\n===Strategic implications===\nAdmiral [[Ch\u016bichi Hara|Hara Tadaichi]] summed up the Japanese result by saying, \"We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war.\"<ref>Haufler, Herve.

Unbeknownst to Yamamoto, who conceived the original plan, the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon 'charging' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war (in keeping with the evolution of [[War Plan Orange|Plan Orange]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Peattie|1997}}</ref> The U.S. instead adopted \"[[Plan Dog]]\" in 1940, which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia, while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Hakim|1995}}</ref>\n\nFortunately for the United States, the American aircraft carriers were untouched; otherwise the Pacific Fleet's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more (given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet). As it was, the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines\u2014the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance. While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service, their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment, and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles (their only major action being the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in October 1944). A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships, in keeping with the doctrine of Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As a result, Yamamoto (and his successors) hoarded battleships for a \"decisive battle\" that never happened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Willmott|1983}}, ''War Plan Orange''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=need full cite.

Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with [[diacritic]]s (''accents''). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on.\n\nISO/IEC 6937's architects were [[Hugh McGregor Ross]], Peter Fenwick, [[w:fr:Bernard Marti|Bernard Marti]] and [[Loek Zeckendorf]].\n\nISO6937/2 defines 327 characters found in modern European languages using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Non-Latin European characters, such as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], are not included in the standard. Also, some diacritics used with the Latin alphabet like the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[S-comma|comma]] are not included, using cedilla instead as no distinction between cedilla and comma below was made at the time.\n\n[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has registered the charset names ''ISO_6937-2-25'' and ''ISO_6937-2-add'' for two (older) versions of this standard (plus control codes). But in practice this character encoding is unused on the Internet.\n\n[[Category:ITU-T T Series Recommendations]]\n\n==Single byte characters==\nThe primary set (first half) originally followed [[ISO 646-IRV]] ''before'' the [[ISO/IEC 646:1991]] revision, that is, mostly following [[ASCII]] but with character 0x24 still denoted as a \"[[international currency sign]]\" (\u00a4) instead of the dollar sign ($). The 1992 edition of ITU T.51 permits existing CCITT services to continue to interpret 0x24 as the international currency sign, but stipulates that new telecommunication applications should use it for the dollar sign (i.e following the current ISO 646-IRV), and instead represent the international currency sign using the supplementary set.<ref name=\"T.51\" />\n\nThe supplementary set (second half) contains a selection of spacing and non-spacing graphic characters, additional symbols and some locations reserved for future standardisation.\n\nBoth of these are [[ISO/IEC 2022]] graphical character sets, with the primary set being a 94-code set and the secondary set being a 96-code set. In contexts where ISO 2022 code extension techniques are not in use, the primary set is designated as the G0 set and invoked over GL ([[hexadecimal|0x]]20..0x7F), whereas the supplementary set is designated as the G2 set and invoked over GR (0xA0..0xFF) in an 8-bit environment, or by using the control code 0x19 as a single-shift in a 7-bit environment.<ref name=\"T.51-amd1995\">{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-T.51-199508-I!Amd1!PDF-E&type=items |title=Recommendation T.51 (1992) Amendment 1 |date=1995-08-11 |author=ITU-T |author-link=ITU-T}}</ref> This encoding of the Single Shift Two code matches its location in [[ISO-IR]]-106.<ref name=\"reg106\">{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/106.pdf |id=ISO-IR-106 |author=ITU |author-link=International Telecommunications Union |title=Teletex Primary Set of Control Functions |date=1985-08-01 |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]]}}</ref>\n\nThe ISO/IEC 2022 [[escape sequence]] to designate the supplementary set of ISO/IEC 6937 as the G2 set is <code>ESC .

It is described as a \"unified superset\" of the Latin-script character repertoires.<ref name=\"T.51\" /> It corresponds to the repertoire of [[ISO/IEC 10367]] when the ASCII, [[Latin-1]] (or [[Latin-5]]), [[Latin-2]] and [[ISO/IEC 10367#Supplementary G3 Latin set|supplementary Latin]] sets are used.<ref name=\"wd6937\" />\n\nThis system also differs from the Unicode [[combining character]] system in that the diacritic code precedes the letter (as opposed to following it), making it more similar to [[ANSEL]].\n\nA little anomaly is that ''Latin Small Letter G with Cedilla'' is coded as if it were with an acute accent, that is, with a 0xC2 lead byte, since due to its descender interfering with a cedilla, the lowercase letter is usually with turned comma above: {{nobr|''\u0122 \u0123''}}.\n\nIn total 13 diacritical marks can be followed by the selected characters from the primary set:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Also, Unicode distinguishes 0xE2 into [[D with stroke]] and uppercase [[Eth]], which usually look different for the lowercase letters (0xF2 and 0xF3).\n\nThe older 1988 edition of ITU T.51 defined two versions of the supplementary set, with the first version lacking the [[non-breaking space]], [[soft hyphen]], not sign ([[\u00ac]]) and broken bar ([[\u00a6]]) present in the second version. The first version was defined as an extension of the [[ITU T.61|T.61]] supplementary set, and the second version as an extension of the first version.<ref name=\"T.51-1988\" /> The current (1992) edition only includes the second version, deprecates certain characters, and updates the primary set to the current ISO-646-IRV ([[ASCII]]), although existing telematic services are permitted to

It was developed in common with [[ITU-T]] (then [[CCITT]]) for telematic services under the name of ''T.51'', and first became an ISO standard in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with [[diacritic]]s (''accents''). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on.\n\nISO/IEC 6937's architects were [[Hugh McGregor Ross]], Peter Fenwick, [[w:fr:Bernard Marti|Bernard Marti]] and [[Loek Zeckendorf]].\n\nISO6937/2 defines 327 characters found in modern European languages using the [[Latin alphabet]]. Non-Latin European characters, such as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], are not included in the standard. Also, some diacritics used with the Latin alphabet like the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] [[S-comma|comma]] are not included, using cedilla instead as no distinction between cedilla and comma below was made at the time.\n\n[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] has registered the charset names ''ISO_6937-2-25'' and ''ISO_6937-2-add'' for two (older) versions of this standard (plus control codes). But in practice this character encoding is unused on the Internet.\n\n[[Category:ITU-T T Series Recommendations]]\n\n==Single byte characters==\nThe primary set (first half) originally followed [[ISO 646-IRV]] ''before'' the [[ISO/IEC 646:1991]] revision, that is, mostly following [[ASCII]] but with character 0x24 still denoted as a \"[[international currency sign]]\" (\u00a4) instead of the dollar sign ($). The 1992 edition of ITU T.51 permits existing CCITT services to continue to interpret 0x24 as the international currency sign, but stipulates that new telecommunication applications should use it for the dollar sign (i.e following the current ISO 646-IRV), and instead represent the international currency sign using the supplementary set.<ref name=\"T.51\" />\n\nThe supplementary set (second half) contains a selection of spacing and non-spacing graphic characters, additional symbols and some locations reserved for future standardisation.\n\nBoth of these are [[ISO/IEC 2022]] graphical character sets, with the primary set being a 94-code set and the secondary set being a 96-code set. In contexts where ISO 2022 code extension techniques are not in use, the primary set is designated as the G0 set and invoked over GL ([[hexadecimal|0x]]20..0x7F), whereas the supplementary set is designated as the G2 set and invoked over GR (0xA0..0xFF) in an 8-bit environment, or by using the control code 0x19 as a single-shift in a 7-bit environment.<ref name=\"T.51-amd1995\">{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-T.51-199508-I!Amd1!PDF-E&type=items |title=Recommendation T.51 (1992) Amendment 1 |date=1995-08-11 |author=ITU-T |author-link=ITU-T}}</ref> This encoding of the Single Shift Two code matches its location in [[ISO-IR]]-106.<ref name=\"reg106\">{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/106.pdf |id=ISO-IR-106 |author=ITU |author-link=International Telecommunications Union |title=Teletex Primary Set of Control Functions |date=1985-08-01 |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]]}}</ref>\n\nThe ISO/IEC 2022 [[escape sequence]] to designate the supplementary set of ISO/IEC 6937 as the G2 set is <code>ESC .

It is described as a \"unified superset\" of the Latin-script character repertoires.<ref name=\"T.51\" /> It corresponds to the repertoire of [[ISO/IEC 10367]] when the ASCII, [[Latin-1]] (or [[Latin-5]]), [[Latin-2]] and [[ISO/IEC 10367#Supplementary G3 Latin set|supplementary Latin]] sets are used.<ref name=\"wd6937\" />\n\nThis system also differs from the Unicode [[combining character]] system in that the diacritic code precedes the letter (as opposed to following it), making it more similar to [[ANSEL]].\n\nA little anomaly is that ''Latin Small Letter G with Cedilla'' is coded as if it were with an acute accent, that is, with a 0xC2 lead byte, since due to its descender interfering with a cedilla, the lowercase letter is usually with turned comma above: {{nobr|''\u0122 \u0123''}}.\n\nIn total 13 diacritical marks can be followed by the selected characters from the primary set:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The first version was defined as an extension of the [[ITU T.61|T.61]] supplementary set, and the second version as an extension of the first version.<ref name=\"T.51-1988\" /> The current (1992)

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} north of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]] in the centre of the parish, Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/>\n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

The arrival of [[Unicode]], with a unique code point for every [[glyph]], resolved these issues.\n\n* [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] or '''Latin-1''' is the most used and also defines the first 256 codes in Unicode\n* [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] modifies ISO-8859-1 to fully support Estonian, Finnish and French and add the [[euro sign]].\n* [[Windows-1252]] is a superset of [[ISO-8859-1]] that includes the characters from [[ISO-8859-15]] and popular punctuation such as curved quotation marks. It is common that web page tools for Windows use Windows-1252 but label the web page as using ISO-8859-1, this has been addressed in HTML 5, which mandates that pages labeled as ISO-8859-1 must be interpreted as Windows-1252.\n* IBM [[Code page 437|CP437]], being intended for English only, has very little in the way of accented letters but has far more graphics characters than the others and also some Greek characters that are useful as technical symbols.\n* IBM [[Code page 850|CP850]] has all the printable characters that ISO-8859-1 has (albeit arranged differently) and still manages to have enough graphics characters to build a usable text-mode user interface.\n* IBM [[Code page 858|CP858]] differs from CP850 only by one character \u2014 a ''dotless i'' (\u0131), rarely used outside Turkey, was replaced by ''euro currency sign'' (\u20ac).<ref name=\"IBM2\"/>\n* IBM [[Code page 859|CP859]] contains all the printable characters that ISO-8859-15 has, so unlike CP850 it supports the \u20ac, Finnish and French.\n* IBM code pages [[EBCDIC 037|037]], [[EBCDIC 500|500]], and [[EBCDIC 1047|1047]] are [[EBCDIC]] encodings that include all of the ISO-8859-1 characters.\n* The [[Mac OS Roman]] character set (often referred to as MacRoman and known by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] as simply MACINTOSH) has most, but not all, of the same characters as ISO-8859-1 but in a very different arrangement; and it also adds many technical and mathematical characters (though it lacks the important \u00d7) and more diacritics. Older Macintosh [[web browser]]s were known to [[Mung (computer term)|munge]] the few characters that were in ISO-8859-1 but not their native Macintosh character set when editing text from Web sites.  Conversely, in Web material prepared on an older Macintosh, many characters were displayed incorrectly when read by other operating systems.\n\n==History==\nThe earlier seven-[[bit]] U.S. [[ASCII]] encoding has characters sufficient to properly represent only English, Latin, and Swahili.  It is missing some letters and letter-diacritic combinations used in other Latin-alphabet languages. However, since there was no other choice on most U.S.-supplied computer platforms, ASCII was unavoidable in most of the non-English-speaking world (seven-bit encoding was necessitated by the limitations of early computing networks). There was the [[ISO 646]] group of encodings which replaced some of the symbols in ASCII with local characters, but space was very limited, and some of the symbols replaced were quite common in things like programming languages. <!-- In the UK, ICL added the \u00a3 sign.  In France, Bull reused many of the \"programming\" symbols with accented letters.  In Russia, Cyrillic was ubiquitous.  This para needs rewriting -->\n\nAlthough seven-bit communication was the norm, most computers internally used eight-bit bytes, and they mostly put some form of characters in the 128 higher byte positions. In the early days most of these were system specific, but gradually a few standards were settled on.\n\nIn recent years, as storage and memory costs fall, the issues associated with multiple meanings of a given eight-bit code (there are seven ISO-Latin code sets alone) have ceased to be justified.  All major operating systems have moved to [[Unicode]] as their main internal representation. However Windows does not support Unicode using their 8-bit character interfaces (by supporting [[UTF-8]] in standard interfaces such as <tt>fopen</tt>), so many applications continue to be restricted to these legacy character sets.\n\n===The euro sign===\nThe [[euro]] and its [[euro sign]] introduced significant pressure to support the euro sign (\u20ac), and most 8-bit character sets had to be adapted in some way.\n* Apple with MacRoman and [[Sun Microsystems]] with [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris OS]] simply replaced the generic currency sign ([[\u00a4]]). This caused significant difficulty because organisations had found other uses for it, such as the company logo. \n* ISO introduced a further variant of ISO 8859, [[ISO 8859-15]], which replaced the generic currency sign with the euro sign as well as making some other replacements of symbols with letters with diacritics. ISO 8859-15 never received widespread adoption.\n* [[Windows-1252]] placed the euro sign in a gap (position 80<sub>hex</sub>) in the existing [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1 control codes]].\n\nAll of these issues have been resolved as operating systems have been upgraded to support [[Unicode]] as standard, which encodes the euro sign at U+20AC (decimal 8364).\n\n== Comparison table ==\nCode points {{U+|0000}} to U+007F are not shown in this table currently, as they are directly mapped in all character sets listed here.  The [[ASCII#ASCII printable characters|ASCII]] coding standard defines the original specification for the mapping of the first 0-127 characters.\n\nThe table is arranged by [[Unicode]] code point. Character sets are referred to here by their [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] names in [[upper case]].\n\n<!-- see talk page for code used to generate this table (note: the table has been manually edited since last generation so bear this in mind if you plan to re-generate to say add a new character set.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The reason for this might have been down to existing restrictions in the implementation of the codepage switching logic under [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC&nbsp;DOS]], which limited .CPI files to 64&nbsp;KB in size or about six codepages maximum, a limitation, which was circumvented in some OEM versions of MS-DOS, in [[Windows&nbsp;NT]], and also does not exist in [[DR-DOS]].<!-- <ref name=\"Paul_2001_CPSwitch-64KB-Size\"/> --> Further, the parser in MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS limits the number of possible country / codepage entries in [[COUNTRY.SYS]] files to a maximum of 146 or 438, a limitation non-existent in DR-DOS.<!-- <ref name=\"Paul_2001_CPSwitch-438-Entries\"/> --> So, adding support for codepage 858 might have meant to drop another (e.g. codepage 850) at the same time, which might not have been a viable solution at that time, given that some applications were hard-wired to use codepage 850.</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"IBM2\">{{cite web |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cp/cp00858.html |title=00858 |work=Code pages by CPGID |publisher=[[IBM]] |access-date=2016-06-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606181537/https://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/cp/cp00858.html |archive-date=2016-06-06}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Paul_2001_CPSwitch-438-Entries\">{{cite web |title=Changing codepages in FreeDOS |author-first=Matthias R. |author-last=Paul |date=2001-08-15 |access-date=2016-06-06 |url=http://www.freedos.org/technotes/technote/txt/141.txt |type=Technical design specification based on fd-dev post [http://marc.info/?l=freedos-dev&m=99788711909602&w=2<!-- https://archive.is/3yUpW -->] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606182501/http://www.freedos.org/technotes/technote/txt/141.txt |archive-date=2016-06-06 |quote=The new official ID for the Multilingual \"codepage 850 with EURO SIGN\" is 858, not 850. IBM will switch to use 858 instead of their 850 variant with future issues of their products. [\u2026] I can only guess why they didn't add 858 to their [[EGA.CPI|EGAx.CPI]], [[COUNTRY.SYS]], and [[KEYBOARD.SYS]] files in [[PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000]]. Many third-party applications are designed to work with 850 and didn't know about 858 at the time PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000 was released, so it's easier for everyone, but unfortunately it's not compatible.&nbsp;[\u2026] As explained above, COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS contain only two codepage entries for a given country in Western issues of DOS. (In Arabic and Hebrew issues there can be up to 8 codepages for one country, in theory there is no limit below the range of allowed codepages 1..65534).&nbsp;[\u2026] The problem is that removing support for 850 might have caused compatibility problems with applications which are hard-wired to use 850. Adding 858 as a third choice to all the files would have increased the file and table sizes significantly. The COUNTRY.SYS file parser in MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS [[IO.SYS]]/[[IBMBIO.COM]] sets aside a 6&nbsp;Kb (for DOS&nbsp;6) scratchpad to load all the info. This allows a maximum of 438 entries in a COUNTRY.SYS file to be accepted, otherwise you will get the message \"COUNTRY.SYS too large.\". The [[NLSFUNC]] parser does not have this limitation, and the file parsers in DR-DOS (kernel and NLSFUNC) also do not know of such a restriction.

These encodings were designed for representation of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which use the [[Latin alphabet]], a few additional letters and ones with precomposed [[diacritic]]s, some punctuation, and various symbols (including some Greek letters). Although they're called \"Western European\" many of these languages are spoken all over the world. Also, these character sets happen to support many other languages such as [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Latin language|Classical Latin]]. \n\n''This material is technically obsolete, having been functionally replaced by [[Unicode]]. However it continues to have historical interest.''\n\n== Summary ==\nThe [[ISO-8859]] series of 8-bit character sets encodes all Latin character sets used in [[Europe]], albeit that the same code points have multiple uses that caused some difficulty.  The arrival of [[Unicode]], with a unique code point for every [[glyph]], resolved these issues.\n\n* [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] or '''Latin-1''' is the most used and also defines the first 256 codes in Unicode\n* [[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] modifies ISO-8859-1 to fully support Estonian, Finnish and French and add the [[euro sign]].\n* [[Windows-1252]] is a superset of [[ISO-8859-1]] that includes the characters from [[ISO-8859-15]] and popular punctuation such as curved quotation marks. It is common that web page tools for Windows use Windows-1252 but label the web page as using ISO-8859-1, this has been addressed in HTML 5, which mandates that pages labeled as ISO-8859-1 must be interpreted as Windows-1252.\n* IBM [[Code page 437|CP437]], being intended for English only, has very little in the way of accented letters but has far more graphics characters than the others and also some Greek characters that are useful as technical symbols.\n* IBM [[Code page 850|CP850]] has all the printable characters that ISO-8859-1 has (albeit arranged differently) and still manages to have enough graphics characters to build a usable text-mode user interface.\n* IBM [[Code page 858|CP858]] differs from CP850 only by one character \u2014 a ''dotless i'' (\u0131), rarely used outside Turkey, was replaced by ''euro currency sign'' (\u20ac).<ref name=\"IBM2\"/>\n* IBM [[Code page 859|CP859]] contains all the printable characters that ISO-8859-15 has, so unlike CP850 it supports the \u20ac, Finnish and French.\n* IBM code pages [[EBCDIC 037|037]], [[EBCDIC 500|500]], and [[EBCDIC 1047|1047]] are [[EBCDIC]] encodings that include all of the ISO-8859-1 characters.\n* The [[Mac OS Roman]] character set (often referred to as MacRoman and known by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] as simply MACINTOSH) has most, but not all, of the same characters as ISO-8859-1 but in a very different arrangement; and it also adds many technical and mathematical characters (though it lacks the important \u00d7) and more diacritics. Older Macintosh [[web browser]]s were known to [[Mung (computer term)|munge]] the few characters that were in ISO-8859-1 but not their native Macintosh character set when editing text from Web sites.  Conversely, in Web material prepared on an older Macintosh, many characters were displayed incorrectly when read by other operating systems.\n\n==History==\nThe earlier seven-[[bit]] U.S. [[ASCII]] encoding has characters sufficient to properly represent only English, Latin, and Swahili.  It is missing some letters and letter-diacritic combinations used in other Latin-alphabet languages. However, since there was no other choice on most U.S.-supplied computer platforms, ASCII was unavoidable in most of the non-English-speaking world (seven-bit encoding was necessitated by the limitations of early computing networks). There was the [[ISO 646]] group of encodings which replaced some of the symbols in ASCII with local characters, but space was very limited, and some of the symbols replaced were quite common in things like programming languages. <!-- In the UK, ICL added the \u00a3 sign.  In France, Bull reused many of the \"programming\" symbols with accented letters.  In Russia, Cyrillic was ubiquitous.  This para needs rewriting -->\n\nAlthough seven-bit communication was the norm, most computers internally used eight-bit bytes, and they mostly put some form of characters in the 128 higher byte positions. In the early days most of these were system specific, but gradually a few standards were settled on.\n\nIn recent years, as storage and memory costs fall, the issues associated with multiple meanings of a given eight-bit code (there are seven ISO-Latin code sets alone) have ceased to be justified.  All major operating systems have moved to [[Unicode]] as their main internal representation. However Windows does not support Unicode using their 8-bit character interfaces (by supporting [[UTF-8]] in standard interfaces such as <tt>fopen</tt>), so many applications continue to be restricted to these legacy character sets.\n\n===The euro sign===\nThe [[euro]] and its [[euro sign]] introduced significant pressure to support the euro sign (\u20ac), and most 8-bit character sets had to be adapted in some way.\n* Apple with MacRoman and [[Sun Microsystems]] with [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris OS]] simply replaced the generic currency sign ([[\u00a4]]). This caused significant difficulty because organisations had found other uses for it, such as the company logo. \n* ISO introduced a further variant of ISO 8859, [[ISO 8859-15]], which replaced the generic currency sign with the euro sign as well as making some other replacements of symbols with letters with diacritics. ISO 8859-15 never received widespread adoption.\n* [[Windows-1252]] placed the euro sign in a gap (position 80<sub>hex</sub>) in the existing [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1 control codes]].\n\nAll of these issues have been resolved as operating systems have been upgraded to support [[Unicode]] as standard, which encodes the euro sign at U+20AC (decimal 8364).\n\n== Comparison table ==\nCode points {{U+|0000}} to U+007F are not shown in this table currently, as they are directly mapped in all character sets listed here.  The [[ASCII#ASCII printable characters|ASCII]] coding standard defines the original specification for the mapping of the first 0-127 characters.\n\nThe table is arranged by [[Unicode]] code point. Character sets are referred to here by their [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] names in [[upper case]].\n\n<!-- see talk page for code used to generate this table (note: the table has been manually edited since last generation so bear this in mind if you plan to re-generate to say add a new character set.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

IBM will switch to use 858 instead of their 850 variant with future issues of their products. [\u2026] I can only guess why they didn't add 858 to their [[EGA.CPI|EGAx.CPI]], [[COUNTRY.SYS]], and [[KEYBOARD.SYS]] files in [[PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000]]. Many third-party applications are designed to work with 850 and didn't know about 858 at the time PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2000 was released, so it's easier for everyone, but unfortunately it's not compatible.&nbsp;[\u2026] As explained above, COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYS contain only two codepage entries for a given country in Western issues of DOS. (In Arabic and Hebrew issues there can be up to 8 codepages for one country, in theory there is no limit below the range of allowed codepages 1..65534).&nbsp;[\u2026] The problem is that removing support for 850 might have caused compatibility problems with applications which are hard-wired to use 850. Adding 858 as a third choice to all the files would have increased the file and table sizes significantly. The COUNTRY.SYS file parser in MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS [[IO.SYS]]/[[IBMBIO.COM]] sets aside a 6&nbsp;Kb (for DOS&nbsp;6) scratchpad to load all the info. This allows a maximum of 438 entries in a COUNTRY.SYS file to be accepted, otherwise you will get the message \"COUNTRY.SYS too large.\". The [[NLSFUNC]] parser does not have this limitation, and the file parsers in DR-DOS (kernel and NLSFUNC) also do not know of such a restriction. Older issues of MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS even had a 2&nbsp;Kb buffer for a maximum of 146 entries.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Paul_2001_CPSwitch-64KB-Size\">{{cite web |title=Changing codepages in FreeDOS (follow-up) |author-first=Matthias R. |author-last=Paul |date=2001-08-27 |access-date=2013-05-08 |url=http://marc.info/?l=freedos-dev&m=99895886029809&w=2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.is/G3y2F |archive-date=2014-10-01 |quote=[\u2026] one could also create custom .CPI files in the traditional FONT style without difficulties, but you could only store up to [\u2026] six codepages in such a file if it should be useable by MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS (some OEM issues and NT can handle files larger than 64&nbsp;Kb, but MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS can not).}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{character encoding}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Western Latin Character Sets (Computing)}}\n[[Category:Character sets]]\n[[Category:Articles with unsupported PUA characters]]\n[[Category:History of computing]]\n", "name_user": "R'n'B", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links to' (disambiguation)(link changed toSingle quotation mark) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Latin_character_sets_(computing)"}

In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Cycling Champion]] and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. Henie initially showed talent at [[skiing]], then followed her older brother, Leif, to take up [[figure skating]]. As a girl Henie also was a nationally ranked [[tennis]] player, and a skilled [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina, [[Tamara Karsavina]], to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning '&#39;Sonja Henie/utdypning'&#39; (Store norske leksikon)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008193424/http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning |date=8 October 2012 }}. Snl.no. Retrieved on 19 August 2015.</ref>\n\n===Competitive career===\nHenie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10. She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], at the age of eleven.<ref name=sr>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html Sonja Heni] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309082541/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html |date=9 March 2010 }}. sports-reference.com</ref> During the 1924 program, she skated over to the side of the rink several times to ask her coach for directions, but by the next Olympiad, she needed no such assistance.\n\nHenie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen. The results of 1927 World Championships, where Henie won in 3\u20132 decision (or 7 vs. 8 ordinal points) over the defending Olympic and World Champion [[Herma Szabo]] of [[Austria]], was controversial, as three of the five judges that gave Henie first-place ordinals were Norwegian (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 points) while Szabo received first-place ordinals from an Austrian and a German Judge (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points). Henie went on to win first of her three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals the following year, became one of the [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating by age#Youngest champions|youngest]] figure skating Olympic champions. She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her world titles annually until 1936.<ref name=sr/> She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936. Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies' single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion. While [[Irina Slutskaya]] of Russia won her seventh European Championship in 2006 to become the most successful ladies' skater in European Championships, Henie retains record of most consecutive titles, sharing it with [[Katarina Witt]] of [[Eastern Germany]]/[[Germany]] (1983\u20131988).\n\nTowards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including [[Cecilia Colledge]], [[Megan Taylor]], and [[Hedy Stenuf]]. However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]], albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second. Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points. As Sandra Stevenson recounted in her article in ''[[The Independent]]'' of 21 April 2008, \"the closeness [of the competition] infuriated Henie, who, when the result for that section was posted on a wall in the competitors' lounge, swiped the piece of paper and tore it into little pieces. The draw for the free skating [then] came under suspicion after Henie landed the plum position of skating last, while Colledge had to perform second of the 26 competitors. The early start was seen as a disadvantage, with the audience not yet whipped into a clapping frenzy and the judges known to become freer with their higher marks as the event proceeded. Years later, a fairer, staggered draw was adopted to counteract this situation\".\n\nDuring her competitive career, Henie traveled widely and worked with a variety of foreign coaches. At home in Oslo, she trained at [[Frogner|Frogner Stadium]], where her coaches included Hj\u00f8rdis Olsen and Oscar Holte. During the latter part of her competitive career she was coached primarily by the American Howard Nicholson in [[London]]. In addition to traveling to train and compete, she was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and North America. Henie became so popular with the public that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various disparate cities such as [[Prague]] and [[New York City]]. It was an open secret that, in spite of the strict [[amateur sports|amateurism]] requirements of the time, Wilhelm Henie demanded \"expense money\" for his daughter's skating appearances. Both of Henie's parents had given up their own pursuits in Norway\u2014leaving Leif to run the fur business\u2014in order to accompany Sonja on her travels and act as her managers.\n\nHenie is credited with being the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating, wear white boots,<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Laura |title=Sonja Henie's Ice Age |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/sonja-henie-ice-skating-queen |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Vanity Fair |date=11 February 2014}}</ref> and make use of dance [[choreography]]. Her innovative skating techniques and glamorous demeanor transformed the sport permanently and confirmed its acceptance as a legitimate sport in the Winter Olympics.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/top_100/4/ ''100 Greatest Female Athletes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911201834/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/top_100/4/ |date=11 September 2006 }} (''Sports Illustrated'')</ref>\n\n===Professional and film career===\n[[File:Sonja Henie on Time Magazine 1939.jpg|right|thumb|Sonja Henie appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] on July 17, 1939.]]\n\nAfter the 1936 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], Henie gave up her amateur status and took up a career as a professional performer in acting and live shows.<ref name=sr/> While still a girl, Henie had decided that she wanted to move to [[California]] and become a movie star when her competitive days were over, without considering that her thick accent might hinder her acting ambitions.\n\nIn 1936, following a successful ice show in [[Los Angeles]] orchestrated by her father to launch her film career, Hollywood studio chief [[Darryl Zanuck]] signed her to a long term contract at [[Twentieth Century Fox]], which made her one of the highest-paid actresses of the time. After the success of her first film, ''[[One in a Million (1936 film)|One in a Million]]'' (1936), Henie's position was assured and she became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck. Henie also insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films such as ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939).\n\nHenie tried to break the musical comedy mould with the anti-Nazi film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Pleasure (film)|It's a Pleasure]]'' (1945), a skating variation of the often-told ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' tale about alcoholic-star-in-decline-helps-newcomer-up. It was her only film shot in [[Technicolor]], but it was not as huge at the box office as her other films and also proved her limitations as a dramatic actress in her one only dramatic film.\n\nWhen Zanuck realized her limits in the pseudo-dramatic vein, he cast her in more musical comedies; ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941) with [[Glenn Miller]], [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], [[The Nicholas Brothers]], and hit songs such as \"[[In the Mood]]\", \"[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]\", \"[[It Happened in Sun Valley]]\", and \"[[I Know Why (And So Do You)]]\", followed by ''[[Iceland (film)|Iceland]]'' (1942) with [[Jack Oakie]], Payne, and the hit song \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\", and finally ''[[Wintertime (film)|Wintertime]]'' (1943) with [[Cesar Romero]], [[Carole Landis]], [[Cornel Wilde]], and Oakie. Sonja had by now developed a comedy flair and these films were all among the top box-office hits for [[20th Century-Fox]] the respective years.\n\nIn addition to her film career at Fox from 1936 to 1943, Henie formed a business arrangement with [[Arthur Wirtz]], who produced her touring ice shows under the name of \"Hollywood Ice Revue\". Wirtz also acted as Henie's financial advisor. At the time, figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States. Henie's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment. Throughout the 1940s, Henie and Wirtz produced lavish musical ice skating extravaganzas at [[Rockefeller Center]]'s [[Center Theatre (New York, New York)|Center Theatre]] attracting millions of ticket buyers.\n\nAt the height of her fame, Henie brought as much as $2 million per year from her shows and touring activities. She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts, and deals to market skates, clothing, jewelry, dolls, and other merchandise branded with her name. These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time.\n[[File:Sonja Henie graumans.jpg|thumb|left|Henie's handprint/signature in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]]]\nHenie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name \"Sonja Henie Ice Revue\". It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz, whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]]. Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates, Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as [[Ice Capades]]. The collapse of a section of bleachers during a show in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1952 compounded the tour's legal and financial woes.\n\nIn 1953, Henie formed a new partnership with [[Morris Chalfen]] to appear in his European ''[[Holiday On Ice]]'' tour, which proved to be a great success. She produced her own show at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in January 1956.<ref>Bosley Crowther, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20A1FF83459157B93C0A8178AD85F428585F9 \"Screen: 'The Lieutenant Wore Skirts\"]. ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1956.</ref> However, a subsequent South American tour in 1956 was a disaster. Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring, and this marked her retirement from skating. She did try to make a film series at her own expense; a series that would serve as a travelogue to several cities. Paris and London were mentioned, but only ''[[Hello London]]'' (1958) was made with her own backing, co-starring [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] and special guest star [[Stanley Holloway]]. While her ice show numbers were still worth watching, the film received few distributors and poor reviews, ending her film career. \n\nHer autobiography ''Mitt livs eventyr'', was published in 1938 which was translated and released as ''Wings on My Feet'' in 1940, and which was republished in a revised edition in 1954. At the time of her death, Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970. She was to have danced to \"[[Lara's Theme]]\" from ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.\n\n===Nazi controversy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09482, Sonja Henie.jpg|thumb|Henie in Berlin, 1930]]\nHenie's connections with [[Adolf Hitler]] and other high-ranking [[Nazi]] officials made her the subject of controversy before, during, and after [[World War II]]. During her amateur skating career, she performed often in [[Germany]] and was a favorite of German audiences and of Hitler personally. As a wealthy celebrity, she moved in the same social circles as royalty and heads of state and made Hitler's acquaintance as a matter of course. During the shooting of ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939), she greeted the then Crown-Prince couple of Norway [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] and [[Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|M\u00e4rtha]] during their US tour. Through the years, her shows and later art exhibitions drew the attention of such people as [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] and she met with them.\n[[File:Sonja Henie & Adolf Hitler 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Henie with Hitler in 1936]]\nControversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a [[Nazi salute]] at the 1936 Winter Olympics in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby [[Berchtesgaden]], where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription. She was strongly denounced in the Norwegian press for this. In her revised 1954 biography,<ref group=note>Page 39</ref> she states that no Norwegian judge was in the panel for the 1936 Olympics\u2014as she was entitled to as a Norwegian. She therefore made the most of it and won her third Olympic medal. When she\u2014as a gold medal winner\u2014passed Hitler's tribune with silver medalist [[Cecilia Colledge]] and bronze medalist [[Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n]], neither she nor the others honored Hitler with the Nazi salute. The [[1936 European Figure Skating Championships]] also took place in Berlin and neither Henie, Colledge, nor [[Megan Taylor]] paid obeisance to Hitler.{{cn|date=December 2019}} \n\nIn her film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939), [[Ray Milland]] and [[Robert Cummings]] star as rival reporters hot on the trail of Hugo Norden (Maurice Moscovich). Norden, a Nobel Prize winner, was supposedly murdered by the Gestapo, but is rumored to be in hiding and writing anonymous dispatches advocating world peace. When Geoffrey and Ken track Norden to a small village in the Swiss Alps, they soon find themselves competing over the affections of beautiful Louise (Henie), who has a deeper connection to the missing Nobel laureate than the reporters realize. When Geoffrey and Ken get so distracted by romance that they begin to neglect their assignments, it almost leads to disaster as the Gestapo sets out to silence Norden once and for all. Released on 22 December 1939, it was banned in Nazi Germany.\n\nThrough her 1940 marriage to [[Dan Topping]] she had become an American citizen. As such, she was not eligible to speak Norway's cause and with producer [[Alexander Korda]], who was set to produce the propaganda film [[That Hamilton Woman]], could have faced deportation. The Senate Subcommittee (Senate Foreign Relations) dealt with such matters. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], when America was no longer neutral, Henie pulled in uniform and visited and gave money to [[Little Norway]]. All Norwegians got free tickets to her shows during the war and she paid and held parties for them.\n\nDuring the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], German troops saw Hitler's autographed photo prominently displayed at the piano in the Henie family home in [[Land\u00f8ya]], [[Asker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sonja Henie|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|accessdate=27 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042510/http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|archive-date=2 July 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, none of Henie's properties in Norway were confiscated or damaged by the Germans. Henie became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]] in 1940. Like many Hollywood stars, she supported the U.S. war effort through [[USO]] and similar activities. After the Japanese attack, she invited the boys from [[Little Norway]] to her ice shows, gave the mechanics a plane as well a substantial sum of money to their educational fund. But her first rejection before the US entered the war was never to be forgotten. For this, she was condemned by many Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans. After the war, Henie was mindful that many of her countrymen considered her to be a [[quisling]]. However, she made a triumphant return to Norway with the [[Holiday on Ice]] tour in 1953 and 1955. The [[Norwegian Royal Family]] attended both events and indeed attended her funeral in 1969. The Royal Family were very mindful of whom they supported after the war and Norwegians looked to them as role models in that respect.\n\n===Personal life===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/display.cfm?ms=uclalat_1429_b519_222464 '''Sonja Henie'''] with her art collection in Los Angeles, 1964.

She was a three-time [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating|Olympic Champion]] ([[Figure skating at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[Figure skating at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932]], [[Figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]]) in women's Singles, a ten-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]] (1927\u20131936) and a six-time [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Champion]] (1931\u20131936). Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other ladies' figure skater. At the height of her acting career, she was one of the highest-paid stars in [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] and starred in a series of box-office hits, including ''[[Thin Ice (1937 film)|Thin Ice]]'' (1937), [[Happy Landing (1938 film)]], ''[[My Lucky Star (1938 film)|My Lucky Star]]'' (1938), ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939) and ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941).<ref>[http://www.snl.no/Sonja_Henie '&#39;Sonja Henie'&#39; (Store norske leksikon)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008193416/http://snl.no/Sonja_Henie |date=8 October 2012 }}. Snl.no (13 March 2014). Retrieved on 19 August 2015.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHenie was born in 1912 in Kristiania (now [[Oslo]]) Norway; she was the only daughter of [[Wilhelm Henie]] (1872\u20131937), a prosperous Norwegian [[fur clothing|furrier]], and his wife, Selma Lochmann-Nielsen (1888\u20131961). In addition to the income from the fur business, both of Henie's parents had inherited wealth. Wilhelm Henie had been a one-time [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships|World Cycling Champion]] and the Henie children were encouraged to take up a variety of sports at a young age. Henie initially showed talent at [[skiing]], then followed her older brother, Leif, to take up [[figure skating]]. As a girl Henie also was a nationally ranked [[tennis]] player, and a skilled [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. Once Henie began serious training as a figure skater, her formal schooling ended. She was educated by tutors, and her father hired the best experts in the world, including the famous Russian ballerina, [[Tamara Karsavina]], to transform his daughter into a sporting celebrity.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning '&#39;Sonja Henie/utdypning'&#39; (Store norske leksikon)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008193424/http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Sonja_Henie/utdypning |date=8 October 2012 }}. Snl.no. Retrieved on 19 August 2015.</ref>\n\n===Competitive career===\nHenie won her first major competition, the senior Norwegian championships, at the age of 10. She then placed eighth in a field of eight at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]], at the age of eleven.<ref name=sr>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html Sonja Heni] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309082541/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/he/sonja-henie-1.html |date=9 March 2010 }}. sports-reference.com</ref> During the 1924 program, she skated over to the side of the rink several times to ask her coach for directions, but by the next Olympiad, she needed no such assistance.\n\nHenie won the first of an unprecedented ten consecutive World Figure Skating Championships in 1927 at the age of fourteen. The results of 1927 World Championships, where Henie won in 3\u20132 decision (or 7 vs. 8 ordinal points) over the defending Olympic and World Champion [[Herma Szabo]] of [[Austria]], was controversial, as three of the five judges that gave Henie first-place ordinals were Norwegian (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 points) while Szabo received first-place ordinals from an Austrian and a German Judge (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 points). Henie went on to win first of her three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals the following year, became one of the [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating by age#Youngest champions|youngest]] figure skating Olympic champions. She defended her Olympic titles in 1932 and in 1936, and her world titles annually until 1936.<ref name=sr/> She also won six consecutive European championships from 1931 to 1936. Henie's unprecedented three Olympic gold medals haven't been matched by any ladies' single skater since; neither are her achievements as ten-time consecutive World Champion. While [[Irina Slutskaya]] of Russia won her seventh European Championship in 2006 to become the most successful ladies' skater in European Championships, Henie retains record of most consecutive titles, sharing it with [[Katarina Witt]] of [[Eastern Germany]]/[[Germany]] (1983\u20131988).\n\nTowards the end of her career, she began to be strongly challenged by younger skaters including [[Cecilia Colledge]], [[Megan Taylor]], and [[Hedy Stenuf]]. However, she held off these competitors and went on to win her third Olympic title at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]], albeit in very controversial circumstances with Cecilia Colledge finishing a very close second. Indeed, after the school figures section at the 1936 Olympic competition, Colledge and Henie were virtually neck and neck with Colledge trailing by just a few points. As Sandra Stevenson recounted in her article in ''[[The Independent]]'' of 21 April 2008, \"the closeness [of the competition] infuriated Henie, who, when the result for that section was posted on a wall in the competitors' lounge, swiped the piece of paper and tore it into little pieces. The draw for the free skating [then] came under suspicion after Henie landed the plum position of skating last, while Colledge had to perform second of the 26 competitors. The early start was seen as a disadvantage, with the audience not yet whipped into a clapping frenzy and the judges known to become freer with their higher marks as the event proceeded. Years later, a fairer, staggered draw was adopted to counteract this situation\".\n\nDuring her competitive career, Henie traveled widely and worked with a variety of foreign coaches. At home in Oslo, she trained at [[Frogner|Frogner Stadium]], where her coaches included Hj\u00f8rdis Olsen and Oscar Holte. During the latter part of her competitive career she was coached primarily by the American Howard Nicholson in [[London]]. In addition to traveling to train and compete, she was much in demand as a performer at figure skating exhibitions in both Europe and North America. Henie became so popular with the public that police had to be called out for crowd control on her appearances in various disparate cities such as [[Prague]] and [[New York City]]. It was an open secret that, in spite of the strict [[amateur sports|amateurism]] requirements of the time, Wilhelm Henie demanded \"expense money\" for his daughter's skating appearances. Both of Henie's parents had given up their own pursuits in Norway\u2014leaving Leif to run the fur business\u2014in order to accompany Sonja on her travels and act as her managers.\n\nHenie is credited with being the first figure skater to adopt the short skirt costume in figure skating, wear white boots,<ref name=\"Jacobs\">{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Laura |title=Sonja Henie's Ice Age |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/02/sonja-henie-ice-skating-queen |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Vanity Fair |date=11 February 2014}}</ref> and make use of dance [[choreography]]. Her innovative skating techniques and glamorous demeanor transformed the sport permanently and confirmed its acceptance as a legitimate sport in the Winter Olympics.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/top_100/4/ ''100 Greatest Female Athletes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911201834/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/siforwomen/top_100/4/ |date=11 September 2006 }} (''Sports Illustrated'')</ref>\n\n===Professional and film career===\n[[File:Sonja Henie on Time Magazine 1939.jpg|right|thumb|Sonja Henie appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] on July 17, 1939.]]\n\nAfter the 1936 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], Henie gave up her amateur status and took up a career as a professional performer in acting and live shows.<ref name=sr/> While still a girl, Henie had decided that she wanted to move to [[California]] and become a movie star when her competitive days were over, without considering that her thick accent might hinder her acting ambitions.\n\nIn 1936, following a successful ice show in [[Los Angeles]] orchestrated by her father to launch her film career, Hollywood studio chief [[Darryl Zanuck]] signed her to a long term contract at [[Twentieth Century Fox]], which made her one of the highest-paid actresses of the time. After the success of her first film, ''[[One in a Million (1936 film)|One in a Million]]'' (1936), Henie's position was assured and she became increasingly demanding in her business dealings with Zanuck. Henie also insisted on having total control of the skating numbers in her films such as ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939).\n\nHenie tried to break the musical comedy mould with the anti-Nazi film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Pleasure (film)|It's a Pleasure]]'' (1945), a skating variation of the often-told ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' tale about alcoholic-star-in-decline-helps-newcomer-up. It was her only film shot in [[Technicolor]], but it was not as huge at the box office as her other films and also proved her limitations as a dramatic actress in her one only dramatic film.\n\nWhen Zanuck realized her limits in the pseudo-dramatic vein, he cast her in more musical comedies; ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941) with [[Glenn Miller]], [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], [[The Nicholas Brothers]], and hit songs such as \"[[In the Mood]]\", \"[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]\", \"[[It Happened in Sun Valley]]\", and \"[[I Know Why (And So Do You)]]\", followed by ''[[Iceland (film)|Iceland]]'' (1942) with [[Jack Oakie]], Payne, and the hit song \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\", and finally ''[[Wintertime (film)|Wintertime]]'' (1943) with [[Cesar Romero]], [[Carole Landis]], [[Cornel Wilde]], and Oakie. Sonja had by now developed a comedy flair and these films were all among the top box-office hits for [[20th Century-Fox]] the respective years.\n\nIn addition to her film career at Fox from 1936 to 1943, Henie formed a business arrangement with [[Arthur Wirtz]], who produced her touring ice shows under the name of \"Hollywood Ice Revue\". Wirtz also acted as Henie's financial advisor. At the time, figure skating and ice shows were not yet an established form of entertainment in the United States. Henie's popularity as a film actress attracted many new fans and instituted skating shows as a popular new entertainment. Throughout the 1940s, Henie and Wirtz produced lavish musical ice skating extravaganzas at [[Rockefeller Center]]'s [[Center Theatre (New York, New York)|Center Theatre]] attracting millions of ticket buyers.\n\nAt the height of her fame, Henie brought as much as $2 million per year from her shows and touring activities. She also had numerous lucrative endorsement contracts, and deals to market skates, clothing, jewelry, dolls, and other merchandise branded with her name. These activities made her one of the wealthiest women in the world in her time.\n[[File:Sonja Henie graumans.jpg|thumb|left|Henie's handprint/signature in front of the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]]]\nHenie broke off her arrangement with Wirtz in 1950 and for the next three seasons produced her own tours under the name \"Sonja Henie Ice Revue\". It was an ill-advised decision to set herself up in competition with Wirtz, whose shows now featured the new Olympic champion [[Barbara Ann Scott]]. Since Wirtz controlled the best arenas and dates, Henie was left playing smaller venues and markets already saturated by other touring ice shows such as [[Ice Capades]]. The collapse of a section of bleachers during a show in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1952 compounded the tour's legal and financial woes.\n\nIn 1953, Henie formed a new partnership with [[Morris Chalfen]] to appear in his European ''[[Holiday On Ice]]'' tour, which proved to be a great success. She produced her own show at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in January 1956.<ref>Bosley Crowther, [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20A1FF83459157B93C0A8178AD85F428585F9 \"Screen: 'The Lieutenant Wore Skirts\"]. ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1956.</ref> However, a subsequent South American tour in 1956 was a disaster. Henie was drinking heavily at that time and could no longer keep up with the demands of touring, and this marked her retirement from skating. She did try to make a film series at her own expense; a series that would serve as a travelogue to several cities. Paris and London were mentioned, but only ''[[Hello London]]'' (1958) was made with her own backing, co-starring [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] and special guest star [[Stanley Holloway]]. While her ice show numbers were still worth watching, the film received few distributors and poor reviews, ending her film career. \n\nHer autobiography ''Mitt livs eventyr'', was published in 1938 which was translated and released as ''Wings on My Feet'' in 1940, and which was republished in a revised edition in 1954. At the time of her death, Henie was planning a comeback for a television special that would have aired in January 1970. She was to have danced to \"[[Lara's Theme]]\" from ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.\n\n===Nazi controversy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09482, Sonja Henie.jpg|thumb|Henie in Berlin, 1930]]\nHenie's connections with [[Adolf Hitler]] and other high-ranking [[Nazi]] officials made her the subject of controversy before, during, and after [[World War II]]. During her amateur skating career, she performed often in [[Germany]] and was a favorite of German audiences and of Hitler personally. As a wealthy celebrity, she moved in the same social circles as royalty and heads of state and made Hitler's acquaintance as a matter of course. During the shooting of ''[[Second Fiddle (1939 film)|Second Fiddle]]'' (1939), she greeted the then Crown-Prince couple of Norway [[Olav V of Norway|Olav]] and [[Princess M\u00e4rtha of Sweden|M\u00e4rtha]] during their US tour. Through the years, her shows and later art exhibitions drew the attention of such people as [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] and she met with them.\n[[File:Sonja Henie & Adolf Hitler 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Henie with Hitler in 1936]]\nControversy appeared first when Henie greeted Hitler with a [[Nazi salute]] at the 1936 Winter Olympics in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and after the Games she accepted an invitation to lunch with Hitler at his resort home in nearby [[Berchtesgaden]], where Hitler presented Henie with an autographed photo with a lengthy inscription. She was strongly denounced in the Norwegian press for this. In her revised 1954 biography,<ref group=note>Page 39</ref> she states that no Norwegian judge was in the panel for the 1936 Olympics\u2014as she was entitled to as a Norwegian. She therefore made the most of it and won her third Olympic medal. When she\u2014as a gold medal winner\u2014passed Hitler's tribune with silver medalist [[Cecilia Colledge]] and bronze medalist [[Vivi-Anne Hult\u00e9n]], neither she nor the others honored Hitler with the Nazi salute. The [[1936 European Figure Skating Championships]] also took place in Berlin and neither Henie, Colledge, nor [[Megan Taylor]] paid obeisance to Hitler.{{cn|date=December 2019}} \n\nIn her film ''[[Everything Happens at Night]]'' (1939), [[Ray Milland]] and [[Robert Cummings]] star as rival reporters hot on the trail of Hugo Norden (Maurice Moscovich). Norden, a Nobel Prize winner, was supposedly murdered by the Gestapo, but is rumored to be in hiding and writing anonymous dispatches advocating world peace. When Geoffrey and Ken track Norden to a small village in the Swiss Alps, they soon find themselves competing over the affections of beautiful Louise (Henie), who has a deeper connection to the missing Nobel laureate than the reporters realize. When Geoffrey and Ken get so distracted by romance that they begin to neglect their assignments, it almost leads to disaster as the Gestapo sets out to silence Norden once and for all. Released on 22 December 1939, it was banned in Nazi Germany.\n\nThrough her 1940 marriage to [[Dan Topping]] she had become an American citizen. As such, she was not eligible to speak Norway's cause and with producer [[Alexander Korda]], who was set to produce the propaganda film [[That Hamilton Woman]], could have faced deportation. The Senate Subcommittee (Senate Foreign Relations) dealt with such matters. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], when America was no longer neutral, Henie pulled in uniform and visited and gave money to [[Little Norway]]. All Norwegians got free tickets to her shows during the war and she paid and held parties for them.\n\nDuring the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], German troops saw Hitler's autographed photo prominently displayed at the piano in the Henie family home in [[Land\u00f8ya]], [[Asker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sonja Henie|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|accessdate=27 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702042510/http://www.geni.com/people/Sonja-Henie/6000000015540940745|archive-date=2 July 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result, none of Henie's properties in Norway were confiscated or damaged by the Germans. Henie became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]] in 1940. Like many Hollywood stars, she supported the U.S. war effort through [[USO]] and similar activities. After the Japanese attack, she invited the boys from [[Little Norway]] to her ice shows, gave the mechanics a plane as well a substantial sum of money to their educational fund. But her first rejection before the US entered the war was never to be forgotten. For this, she was condemned by many Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans. After the war, Henie was mindful that many of her countrymen considered her to be a [[quisling]]. However, she made a triumphant return to Norway with the [[Holiday on Ice]] tour in 1953 and 1955. The [[Norwegian Royal Family]] attended both events and indeed attended her funeral in 1969. The Royal Family were very mindful of whom they supported after the war and Norwegians looked to them as role models in that respect.\n\n===Personal life===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/display.cfm?ms=uclalat_1429_b519_222464 '''Sonja Henie'''] with her art collection in Los Angeles, 1964.

Those 32&nbsp;billion arcade games played translate to 143 games for every man, woman, and child in America. A recent Atari survey showed that 86 percent of the US population from 13 to 20 has played some kind of video game and an estimated 8&nbsp;million US homes have video games hooked up to the television set.
