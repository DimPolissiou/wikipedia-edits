After arriving, teams had to find their next clue at [[Masthouse Terrace Pier]], which instructed them to travel by speedboat to [[Savoy Pier]]. After disembarking, teams had to make their way to [[Piccadilly Circus]] and find the [[Living statue|golden queen]], who would give them their next clue.\n*At Camden Market, teams would find the Pit Stop and host Phil Keoghan, who would surprise them with a clue. Teams had to search nearby shops for the marked items in a display and use these items to recreate the display before they could check-in at the Pit Stop.\n\n===Leg 12 (United Kingdom \u2192 United States)===\n[[File:Fort Wayne Barracks, Detroit.jpg|thumb|right|The historic [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)|Fort Wayne]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] served as the Finish Line for ''The Amazing Race 31''.]]\n'''Airdate''': June 26, 2019\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} London ([[Heathrow Airport]]) to [[Metro Detroit|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], '''United States''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]])\n*[[Detroit]] (''[[The Spirit of Detroit]]'')\n*{{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's good with numbers?}} Detroit ([[Guardian Building]])\n*[[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] ([https://fowlingwarehouse.com/ Fowling Warehouse])\n*Detroit ([[Heidelberg Project]]) ''(Unaired)''<ref name=\"freepress\"/>\n*Detroit ([[Third Man Records]])\n*Detroit ([[Philip A.

On the way down, they had to look for a series of numbers that they would need to unlock a [[bank vault]] along with specific turn-by-turn instructions listed in the basement of the building to retrieve their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At Fowling Warehouse, teams had to play a game of [[Fowling (sport)|fowling]] that entailed each team member throwing a [[Ball (gridiron football)|football]] towards each other to knock down [[bowling pin]]s until one member knocked down all ten to receive their next clue.\n*At Heidelberg Project, teams had to search through a field of ''Race'' clue boxes scattered throughout the [[Public art|outdoor art installation]] for one that contained their next clue. This task went unaired in the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2egYwDEG4I&t=5945|title=Amazing Race Season 31 Episodes 11 & 12 with Colin and Christie #RacersRecap|website=[[YouTube]]|date=June 30, 2019|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n*At Third Man Records, teams had to properly [[record press|press]] five [[Phonograph record|two-tone vinyl records]] using ''Race'' colors. Once all vinyl records were correctly made with a distinct line between colors and properly placed labels, a record worker would hand them their next clue.\n*At Hart Plaza, teams had to search amongst a group of [[Rockin' 1000]] musicians to find their next clue atop a drum. Teams then had to assemble a five-piece [[drum kit]] that exactly matched an example, which they couldn't touch, while the musicians played [[The White Stripes]] single \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\". Once the drum kit was correctly assembled, the lead drummer would give teams their final clue.\n\n==Ratings==\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{{Television episode ratings\n| refs_col   = y\n| title1   =

Once all vinyl records were correctly made with a distinct line between colors and properly placed labels, a record worker would hand them their next clue.\n*At Hart Plaza, teams had to search amongst a group of [[Rockin' 1000]] musicians to find their next clue atop a drum. Teams then had to assemble a five-piece [[drum kit]] that exactly matched an example, which they couldn't touch, while the musicians played [[The White Stripes]] single \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\". Once the drum kit was correctly assembled, the lead drummer would give teams their final clue.\n\n==Ratings==\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{{Television episode ratings\n| refs_col   = y\n| title1   =
