A national sensation in high school and outstanding collegian at Villanova University, the athletic 6'10\" 240lb talent played in the [[National_Basketball_Association|National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1998 to 2010 building a solid 12-year career as a pro sprinkled with occasional dazzling hi-light reel performances..\n\n==High school and college career==\nA versatile 6'10\" forward with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at [[Paterson Catholic High School]]. He was ranked as one of the Top-2 recruits in the nation his senior season along with [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.  Thomas also seriously considered making the jump straight to the NBA from high school, waiting to declare [https://vault.si.com/vault/1996/11/15/one-year-and-then-villanova-phenom-tim-thomas-gives-it-the-old-college-try-but-the-call-of-the-nba-is-never-out-of-earshot his decision to attend college] at Villanova until just days before the deadline to enter the NBA Draft.\n\n==NCAA career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season of college ball at Villanova University. Joining an already future NBA talent-laden team with [[Alvin Williams#Basketball career|Alvin Williams]], Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year [[Kerry Kittles#Career highlights|Kerry Kittles]] from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.  Villanova would place 2nd in the Big East tournament but Thomas would be named to both ALL-BIG EAST and ALL-BIG EAST Tournament teams as well as win BIG EAST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR while sporting a 17ppg and 6rpg avg.  Villanova would make the NCAA Tourney but lose in round 2 to a U of California team that featured future NFL All-Pro, [[Tony Gonzalez]].\n\n==NBA career==\nFollowing his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's ALL-ROOKIE 2nd Team. The Sixers would grow impatient with a [[sophomore slump]] from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Jerald Honeycutt]] and [[Tyrone Hill]].\n\n===Milwaukee Bucks===\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/10/28/8118866/6-milwaukee-bucks-with-glenn-robinson-gone-tim-thomas-has-a-chance-to-prove-that-hes-worth-his-big-contractand-that-he-can-fetch-more-wins-than-big-dog|title=6 Milwaukee Bucks With Glenn Robinson gone, Tim Thomas has a chance to prove that he's worth his big contract--and that he can fetch more wins than Big Dog|last=Burns|first=Marty|website=Vault|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It looked like things were coming together for Thomas during the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], when he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks.

American professional basketball player. A national sensation in high school and outstanding collegian at Villanova University, the athletic 6'10\" 240lb talent played in the [[National_Basketball_Association|National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1998 to 2010 building a solid 12-year career as a pro sprinkled with occasional dazzling hi-light reel performances..\n\n==High school and college career==\nA versatile 6'10\" forward with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at [[Paterson Catholic High School]]. He was ranked as one of the Top-2 recruits in the nation his senior season along with [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.  Thomas also seriously considered making the jump straight to the NBA from high school, waiting to declare [https://vault.si.com/vault/1996/11/15/one-year-and-then-villanova-phenom-tim-thomas-gives-it-the-old-college-try-but-the-call-of-the-nba-is-never-out-of-earshot his decision to attend college] at Villanova until just days before the deadline to enter the NBA Draft.\n\n==NCAA career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season of college ball at Villanova University. Joining an already future NBA talent-laden team with [[Alvin Williams#Basketball career|Alvin Williams]], Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year [[Kerry Kittles#Career highlights|Kerry Kittles]] from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.  Villanova would place 2nd in the Big East tournament but Thomas would be named to both ALL-BIG EAST and ALL-BIG EAST Tournament teams as well as win BIG EAST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR while sporting a 17PPG and 6Reb avg.  Villanova would make the NCAA Tourney but lose in round 2 to a U of California team that featured future NFL All-Pro, [[Tony Gonzalez]].\n\n==NBA career==\nFollowing his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's ALL-ROOKIE 2nd Team. The Sixers would grow impatient with a [[sophomore slump]] from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Jerald Honeycutt]] and [[Tyrone Hill]].\n\n===Milwaukee Bucks===\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/10/28/8118866/6-milwaukee-bucks-with-glenn-robinson-gone-tim-thomas-has-a-chance-to-prove-that-hes-worth-his-big-contractand-that-he-can-fetch-more-wins-than-big-dog|title=6 Milwaukee Bucks With Glenn Robinson gone, Tim Thomas has a chance to prove that he's worth his big contract--and that he can fetch more wins than Big Dog|last=Burns|first=Marty|website=Vault|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It looked like things were coming together for Thomas during the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], when he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.
