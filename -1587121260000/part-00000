The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991. It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's [[Uncle Leo]] and Jerry's neighbor [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nFilming of the show moved from [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City, Los Angeles]]. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, [[Larry Charles]] and [[Peter Mehlman]], who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.\n\nA ''Seasons 1 and 2'' [[DVD]] box set was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features [[The Stranded|an episode from the third season that was held over]], bonus material, including [[deleted scene]]s, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries. Four million copies of the DVD were sold by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the sixth-greatest TV season ever made.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\nThe show features an ensemble cast of four characters: [[Jerry Seinfeld]] stars as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictional version of himself]]; [[Jason Alexander]] portrays Seinfeld's neurotic friend [[George Costanza]]; [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] plays [[Elaine Benes]], Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend; and [[Michael Richards]] stars as Seinfeld's neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309157,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Tucker, Ken|date=January 10, 1992|title=Seinfeld (1990\u20131998)|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the characters' evolution during the season: \"As the seasons progress, you can see Michael Richards turn Kramer {{interp|...}} from a vague eccentric {{interp|...}} into a stylized creation who redefined TV's quirky-neighbor type with [[Danny Kaye]] accents.

The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991. It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's [[Uncle Leo]] and Jerry's neighbor [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nFilming of the show moved from [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City, Los Angeles]]. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, [[Larry Charles]] and [[Peter Mehlman]], who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.\n\nA ''Seasons 1 and 2'' [[DVD]] box set was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features [[The Stranded|an episode from the third season that was held over]], bonus material, including [[deleted scene]]s, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries. Four million copies of the DVD were sold by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the sixth-greatest TV season ever made.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\nThe show features an ensemble cast of four characters: [[Jerry Seinfeld]] stars as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictional version of himself]]; [[Jason Alexander]] portrays Seinfeld's neurotic friend [[George Costanza]]; [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] plays [[Elaine Benes]], Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend; and [[Michael Richards]] stars as Seinfeld's neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309157,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Tucker, Ken|date=January 10, 1992|title=Seinfeld (1990\u20131998)|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the characters' evolution during the season: \"As the seasons progress, you can see Michael Richards turn Kramer {{interp|...}} from a vague eccentric {{interp|...}} into a stylized creation who redefined TV's quirky-neighbor type with [[Danny Kaye]] accents. You can see Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{interp|...}} develop Elaine from a puffy-haired gal pal (who wasn't in the pilot) into a delightfully petty urbanite.

Roosevelt]]'s second term. Roosevelt's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] lost a net of 72 seats to the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who also picked up seats from minor Progressive and Farmer\u2013Labor Parties.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the Democratic decline. One main reason was the [[Recession of 1937]]. Unemployment soared, undercutting the Democrats' claim that the [[New Deal]] had ended the [[Great Depression]]. Democrats fought among themselves, especially over [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|Roosevelt's \"Court Packing\" plan]]. In addition, there was backlash against Roosevelt's intervention in the Democratic primaries which angered conservative Democrats.<ref>{{Cite book | title=1939 Britannica Book of the Year, \"Democratic Party\" | pages=205\u2013206}}</ref> The [[labor unions]], which were emerging as a powerful [[grassroots]] factor in the [[New Deal Coalition]], split bitterly as the [[American Federation of Labor]] and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] fought over membership.\n\nInternal Democratic strains were exacerbated by an effort led by Roosevelt to purge certain conservative senators for defeat in Democratic primaries, including [[Walter F. George|Walter George]] of Georgia, [[Millard Tydings]] of Maryland and [[Ellison Smith]] of South Carolina, along with the chairman of the House Rules Committee, [[John J. O'Connor (politician)|John J. O'Connor]] of New York. All but the last were re-elected.{{sfn | Price | page=660-670}}\n\nWhile a number of New Deal supporters won primary elections, such as Sen.

Roosevelt]]'s second term. Roosevelt's [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] lost a net of 72 seats to the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who also picked up seats from minor Progressive and Farmer\u2013Labor Parties.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the Democratic decline. One main reason was the [[Recession of 1937]]. Unemployment soared, undercutting the Democrats' claim that the [[New Deal]] had ended the [[Great Depression]]. Democrats fought among themselves, especially over [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|Roosevelt's \"Court Packing\" plan]]. In addition, there was backlash against Roosevelt's intervention in the Democratic primaries which angered conservative Democrats.<ref>{{Cite book | title=1939 Britannica Book of the Year, \"Democratic Party\" | pages=205\u2013206}}</ref> The [[labor unions]], which were emerging as a powerful [[grassroots]] factor in the [[New Deal Coalition]], split bitterly as the [[American Federation of Labor]] and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] fought over membership.\n\nInternal Democratic strains were exacerbated by an effort led by Roosevelt to purge certain conservative senators for defeat in Democratic primaries, including [[Walter F. George|Walter George]] of Georgia, [[Millard Tydings]] of Maryland and [[Ellison Smith]] of South Carolina, along with the chairman of the House Rules Committee, [[John J. O'Connor (politician)|John J. O'Connor]] of New York. All but the last were re-elected.{{sfn | Price | page=660-670}}\n\nWhile a number of New Deal supporters won primary elections, such as Sen. [[Alben Barkley]] in Kentucky, who defeated [[Happy Chandler]], In Idaho Sen. [[James P. Pope]], a prominent New Deal supporter, lost his bid for re-nomination, as did California senator [[William Gibbs McAdoo|William McAdoo]]. The many seats Democrats won in traditionally Republican districts in the 1930, 1932, 1934 and 1936 elections meant that they had to defend a large number of marginal seats.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans were united; they had shed their weakest members in a series of defeats since 1930.{{sfn | Dunn}} Re-energized Republicans focused attention on strong fresh candidates in major states, especially [[Robert A. Taft]] the conservative from Ohio,<ref>{{Cite book | first=James T. | last=Patterson | title=Mr. Republican: A Biography of Robert A.

A [[Center (basketball)|center]], he was named the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) three times, was a 12-time [[NBA All-Star]] and an eight-time [[All-NBA Team]] selection. Malone led the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] to an [[NBA championship]] in 1983, winning both the league and [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]. He was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility in 2001.\n\nMalone began his professional career out of high school after he was selected in the third round of the [[1974 ABA Draft]] by the [[Utah Stars]]. He was named an [[ABA All-Star]] as a rookie and played two seasons in the league until [[American Basketball Association\u2013National Basketball Association merger|it merged with the NBA]] in 1976. He landed in the NBA with the [[Buffalo Braves]], who traded him after two games to the [[Houston Rockets]]. Malone became a five-time All-Star in six seasons with the Rockets. After leading the NBA in [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] in 1979, he was named league MVP for the first time. He led the Rockets to the [[NBA Finals]] in 1981, and won his second MVP award in 1982. Traded to Philadelphia the following season, he repeated as MVP and led the 76ers to the 1983 championship. In his first of two stints with Philadelphia, he was an All-Star in each of his four seasons. Following another trade, Malone was an All-Star in his only two seasons with the then [[Washington Bullets]] (today's Wizards). He signed as a [[free agent (NBA)|free agent]] with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], earning his 12th straight and final NBA All-Star selection in his first season. In his later years, he played with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] before returning to the 76ers and completing his career with the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nMalone was a tireless and physical player who led the NBA in rebounding six times, including a then-record five straight seasons (1981\u20131985).

Malone''' (March 23, 1955 \u2013 September 13, 2015) was an American [[basketball]] player who played in both the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1974 through 1995. A [[Center (basketball)|center]], he was named the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) three times, was a 12-time [[NBA All-Star]] and an eight-time [[All-NBA Team]] selection. Malone led the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] to an [[NBA championship]] in 1983, winning both the league and [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]. He was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility in 2001.\n\nMalone began his professional career out of high school after he was selected in the third round of the [[1974 ABA Draft]] by the [[Utah Stars]]. He was named an [[ABA All-Star]] as a rookie and played two seasons in the league until [[American Basketball Association\u2013National Basketball Association merger|it merged with the NBA]] in 1976. He landed in the NBA with the [[Buffalo Braves]], who traded him after two games to the [[Houston Rockets]]. Malone became a five-time All-Star in six seasons with the Rockets. After leading the NBA in [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] in 1979, he was named league MVP for the first time. He led the Rockets to the [[NBA Finals]] in 1981, and won his second MVP award in 1982. Traded to Philadelphia the following season, he repeated as MVP and led the 76ers to the 1983 championship. In his first of two stints with Philadelphia, he was an All-Star in each of his four seasons. Following another trade, Malone was an All-Star in his only two seasons with the then [[Washington Bullets]] (today's Wizards). He signed as a [[free agent (NBA)|free agent]] with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], earning his 12th straight and final NBA All-Star selection in his first season. In his later years, he played with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] before returning to the 76ers and completing his career with the [[San Antonio Spurs]].\n\nMalone was a tireless and physical player who led the NBA in rebounding six times, including a then-record five straight seasons (1981\u20131985).

However, with good first and second-round draft choices every year, the Bullets gradually grew to be a better team, adding these players \u2013 who all made the NBA All-Rookie Team: Johnson, [[Rod Thorn]], [[Wali Jones]], [[Jack Marin]], [[Earl Monroe]], and finally, the keystone of a championship team, [[Wes Unseld]], who became both the Rookie-of-the-Year and the NBA Most Valuable Player for 1968\u201369. Gus Johnson was also a key player for the Bullets, who won the NBA Eastern Division for their very first time in 1969.\n\nJohnson was among the most effective two-way players of his time. His scoring moves around the basket were comparable to those of his peers [[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Connie Hawkins]]. Yet, however effective as Johnson was a post-up player, with his medium-range [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]], and on the fast break, he was even more effective as a very sticky defender and a rugged rebounder throughout his time in the NBA. Indeed, he was one of the select few players who was quick enough to be paired against backcourt great [[Oscar Robertson]], yet strong enough to hold his own against the taller forwards of the NBA in the front line.\n\nDespite some nagging problems with his knees, Johnson was a member of the NBA All-Star Team five times. During his NBA career, Johnson averaged 17.1 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. He also scored 25 points in 25 minutes in the [[1965 NBA All-Star Game]].\n\nGus Johnson had his best years with the Bullets in 1968\u201371, including the watershed basketball year of [[1968\u201369 NBA season|1968\u201369]]. While the Bullets improved, Johnson received more recognition from the press and the spectators for his outstanding play at forward. He was voted onto the All-NBA second-team during this time span. During the 1968\u201369 season, the Bullets achieved their best regular-season record, but were quickly swept out of the playoffs by the Knicks, largely because Johnson was sidelined during the playoff series with an injury.\n\nAfter fading to third place in the Eastern Division in [[1969\u201370 NBA season|1969\u201370]], Johnson and the Bullets upset the regular-season champion [[New York Knicks]] four games to three in the [[1971 NBA Playoffs|1971 playoffs]], and advanced to the [[NBA Finals]]. But injuries had decimated the team, and the Bullets were swept in four straight by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], led by [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], Robertson, and [[Bobby Dandridge]].\n\nInjuries kept Johnson on the bench for most of [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372]], limiting him to 39 games and 6 points per game. That season would be his last with the team. The next season, the Bullets traded for [[Elvin Hayes]] and drafted [[Kevin Porter (basketball)|Kevin Porter]], making Johnson expendable. On April 10, 1972 Johnson was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for a 2nd round draft pick ([[Tom Patterson (basketball)|Tom Patterson]]).<ref name=\"ctr\"/>\n\nIn nine seasons with Baltimore, Johnson averaged 17.5 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 35.2 minutes in 560 games.<ref name=\"ctr\" />\n\n===Phoenix Suns (1972)===\nAfter being traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] following the season in April, Johnson played 21 games before being waived on December 1, 1972 after averaging 7.8 points and 6.5 rebounds in 19.9 minutes under coaches [[Butch van Breda Kolff]], who was fired after seven games, and [[Jerry Colangelo]], Johnson's former Baltimore teammate.<ref name=\"ctr\" /> \n\n===Indiana Pacers / ABA Championship 1972-1973)===\nThe [[Indiana Pacers]], then of the [[American Basketball Association]], picked him up after he was recruited to the Pacers by his former Baltimore Coach, Hall of Fame inductee [[Slick Leonard]].

Johnson finished as the runner-up for the [[NBA Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors to [[Jerry Lucas]] of the [[Cincinnati Royals]]; Lucas went on to a [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|hall of fame]] career with the Royals and [[New York Knickerbockers|New York Knicks]]. Lucas and Johnson had faced off against each other during high school in [[Ohio]], and when the [[NBA All-Rookie Team]] was selected, Lucas, Johnson, and his former high school teammate [[Nate Thurmond]] were the top three stars of the team.\n\nDuring their college years, Johnson and Thurmond had been overshadowed by Lucas, who drew recognition from the press as a star with the national champion [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] and the U.S. [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] basketball team (1964). However, being considered just second-best in comparison with Lucas during college was a powerful motivating factor for Johnson when they both moved on to the NBA.<ref name=pluto/>\n\nPlaying with Baltimore under Coach Leonard, the young starting five, consisting of center [[Walt Bellamy]], forwards [[Terry Dischinger]] and Johnson and guards [[Rod Thorn]] and [[Kevin Loughery]] were nicknamed the \"kiddie corps.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-xpm-2014-08-06-bs-sp-slick-leonard-hall-of-fame-0807-20140806-story.html|title=Former players praise Bob 'Slick' Leonard as he heads into Hall of Fame|first=Mike|last=Klingaman|website=baltimoresun.com}}</ref>\n\nSaid Slick Leonard about a young Johnson, \"I could see Gussie developing into one of the great defensive forwards of all time.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nJohnson was both an outstanding inside scorer and an exciting open-court player for the Bullets, from the start. During his early years with the Bullets, an expansion team, regularly finished in last place not only in the Eastern Division, but in the entire NBA. However, with good first and second-round draft choices every year, the Bullets gradually grew to be a better team, adding these players \u2013 who all made the NBA All-Rookie Team: Johnson, [[Rod Thorn]], [[Wali Jones]], [[Jack Marin]], [[Earl Monroe]], and finally, the keystone of a championship team, [[Wes Unseld]], who became both the Rookie-of-the-Year and the NBA Most Valuable Player for 1968\u201369. Gus Johnson was also a key player for the Bullets, who won the NBA Eastern Division for their very first time in 1969.\n\nJohnson was among the most effective two-way players of his time. His scoring moves around the basket were comparable to those of his peers [[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Connie Hawkins]]. Yet, however effective as Johnson was a post-up player, with his medium-range [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]], and on the fast break, he was even more effective as a very sticky defender and a rugged rebounder throughout his time in the NBA. Indeed, he was one of the select few players who was quick enough to be paired against backcourt great [[Oscar Robertson]], yet strong enough to hold his own against the taller forwards of the NBA in the front line.\n\nDespite some nagging problems with his knees, Johnson was a member of the NBA All-Star Team five times. During his NBA career, Johnson averaged 17.1 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. He also scored 25 points in 25 minutes in the [[1965 NBA All-Star Game]].\n\nGus Johnson had his best years with the Bullets in 1968\u201371, including the watershed basketball year of [[1968\u201369 NBA season|1968\u201369]]. While the Bullets improved, Johnson received more recognition from the press and the spectators for his outstanding play at forward. He was voted onto the All-NBA second-team during this time span. During the 1968\u201369 season, the Bullets achieved their best regular-season record, but were quickly swept out of the playoffs by the Knicks, largely because Johnson was sidelined during the playoff series with an injury.\n\nAfter fading to third place in the Eastern Division in [[1969\u201370 NBA season|1969\u201370]], Johnson and the Bullets upset the regular-season champion [[New York Knicks]] four games to three in the [[1971 NBA Playoffs|1971 playoffs]], and advanced to the [[NBA Finals]]. But injuries had decimated the team, and the Bullets were swept in four straight by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], led by [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], Robertson, and [[Bobby Dandridge]].\n\nInjuries kept Johnson on the bench for most of [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372]], limiting him to 39 games and 6 points per game. That season would be his last with the team. The next season, the Bullets traded for [[Elvin Hayes]] and drafted [[Kevin Porter (basketball)|Kevin Porter]], making Johnson expendable. On April 10, 1972 Johnson was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for a 2nd round draft pick ([[Tom Patterson (basketball)|Tom Patterson]]).<ref name=\"ctr\"/>\n\nIn nine seasons with Baltimore, Johnson averaged 17.5 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 35.2 minutes in 560 games.<ref name=\"ctr\" />\n\n===Phoenix Suns (1972)===\nAfter being traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] following the season in April, Johnson played 21 games before being waived on December 1, 1972 after averaging 7.8 points and 6.5 rebounds in 19.9 minutes under coaches [[Butch van Breda Kolff]], who was fired after seven games, and [[Jerry Colangelo]], Johnson's former Baltimore teammate.<ref name=\"ctr\" /> \n\n===Indiana Pacers / ABA Championship 1972-1973)===\nThe [[Indiana Pacers]], then of the [[American Basketball Association]], picked him up after he was recruited to the Pacers by his former Baltimore Coach, Hall of Fame inductee [[Slick Leonard]].
