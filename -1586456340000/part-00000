This fertile area has vineyards and grows cereals, vegetables and fruit. To the east of the Beqaa Valley, the Anti-Lebanon Mountains are orientated in a southwest\u2013northeast direction and the crest of the range forms the border between Lebanon and Syria. The summits here are slightly lower than Mount Lebanon, the daily temperature variations are greater and the winters are colder.<ref name=Atlas>{{cite book |title=Atlas of the World |last=Philip's |year=1994 |publisher=Reed International |isbn=0-540-05831-9 |page=91 }}</ref>\n\nThe Mediterranean coast extends for about {{convert|225|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The coastal plain covers about sixteen percent of the land area of Lebanon but is inhabited by three quarters of the population. The coast itself is mostly flat-ouch- with sandy bays and salt-marshes and a few rocky capes, but lack of like, urban planning or whatever means that much of the coastline has seen indiscriminate development, with deposit of materials for land reclamation and highway construction.

The [[striped hyena]] is Lebanon's national animal and is seldom seen, coming out only at night. They are extinct in some areas, but some thrive and steal livestock and garbage in villages.  Others hunt for rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, and rarely deer or goats. They are extremely shy, and allegedly will not approach any human. However, as recently as 2018 there are confirmed sightings by residents of the [[Kadisha Valley]] region, with local hunters claiming they have shot and killed striped hyenas. The [[red fox]] is also quite common, living in all regions, and eating mostly rodents, livestock, and garbage. The [[Syrian brown bear]] was considered extinct in Lebanon since around 1958, but in December 2016, there was a sighting of a bear and its cub wandering in the snow. The government has then confirmed it was a Syrian Brown Bear. It is weird that a bear would be wandering in the winter, where they usually would be hibernating.

To the east of the Beqaa Valley, the Anti-Lebanon Mountains are orientated in a southwest\u2013northeast direction and the crest of the range forms the border between Lebanon and Syria. The summits here are slightly lower than Mount Lebanon, the daily temperature variations are greater and the winters are colder.<ref name=Atlas>{{cite book |title=Atlas of the World |last=Philip's |year=1994 |publisher=Reed International |isbn=0-540-05831-9 |page=91 }}</ref>\n\nThe Mediterranean coast extends for about {{convert|225|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

However, he was opposed by an important part of the DC, so Tambroni's cabinet returned to the Senate, where it received the confidence vote 29 Apri.\n\nOn 21 May 1960, a rally led by [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] deputy [[Giancarlo Pajetta]] was broken up by the police with support from the government, causing riots.\n\nOn 15 June, the Minister of Culture [[Umberto Tupini]] announced plans to censor all films with \"scandalous subjects, harmful for the consciousness of Italians\", including [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''. \n\n[[Image:Tambroni Genova scontri.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The street fights in 1960 at Genoa]]\nThe most controversial decision of his mandate, however, was the permission to MSI to hold its national congress in [[Genoa]], one of the capitals of Italian Resistance against Fascism. This move was considered a further and unacceptable opening to the former Fascists of the doors of the government. On 30 June 1960, a large demonstration summoned by the left-wing [[CGIL]] trade union and by other leftist forces in the streets of Genoa was heavily suppressed by the Italian police. Other popular demonstrations in [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Rome]], [[Palermo]], [[Catania]], [[Licata]] again saw violent intervention by the police, causing several deaths. Eventually, after grievances coming also from some sectors of Democrazia Cristiana, Tambroni was forced to resign, having been in charge only 116 days.\n\nHe died a few years later in [[Rome]] due to [[cardiac arrest]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.linearossage.it/leforze.htm Photogallery documenting Italian police's interventions in Genoa on 30 June 1960] {{in lang|it}}\n<BR>\n{{start box}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|title=Italian Minister of Merchant Navy|before=[[Bernardo Mattarella]]|after=[[Gennaro Cassiani]]|years=1953\u20131955}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Italian Minister of the Interior]]|before=[[Mario Scelba]]|after=[[Antonio Segni]]|years=1955\u20131959}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Italian Minister of Treasury]]|before=[[Giulio Andreotti]]|after=[[Paolo Emilio Taviani]]|years=1959\u20131960}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Italian Minister of Budget]]|before=[[Giuseppe Medici]]|after=[[Giuseppe Pella]]|years=1959\u20131960}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Prime Minister of Italy]]|before=[[Antonio Segni]]|after=[[Amintore Fanfani]]|years=1960}}\n|-\n{{s-par|it-lwr}}\n{{s-bef|before=None, Parliament re-established}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Marche]]<br>Legislatures: CA, I, II, III|years=1946 &ndash;

But the political importance assumed by the debate and the growing tensions within the DC, with some ministers threatening their resignation, forced Tambroni to resign. President Gronchi gave then the task of forming a new cabinet to Fanfani, to verify the possibility of starting a centre-left government. However, he was opposed by an important part of the DC, so Tambroni's cabinet returned to the Senate, where it received the confidence vote 29 Apri.\n\nOn 21 May 1960, a rally led by [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] deputy [[Giancarlo Pajetta]] was broken up by the police with support from the government, causing riots.\n\nOn 15 June, the Minister of Culture [[Umberto Tupini]] announced plans to censor all films with \"scandalous subjects, harmful for the consciousness of Italians\", including [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''. \n\n[[Image:Tambroni Genova scontri.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The street fights in 1960 at Genoa]]\nThe most controversial decision of his mandate, however, was the permission to MSI to hold its national congress in [[Genoa]], one of the capitals of Italian Resistance against Fascism. This move was considered a further and unacceptable opening to the former Fascists of the doors of the government. On 30 June 1960, a large demonstration summoned by the left-wing [[CGIL]] trade union and by other leftist forces in the streets of Genoa was heavily suppressed by the Italian police. Other popular demonstrations in [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Rome]], [[Palermo]], [[Catania]], [[Licata]] again saw violent intervention by the police, causing several deaths.

They are named so because they release new peptides from the ribosome.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring translation of mRNA, most [[codons]] are recognized by \"charged\" [[tRNA]] molecules, called [[aminoacyl-tRNA]]s because they are adhered to specific [[amino acid]]s corresponding to each tRNA's [[anticodon]]. In the standard [[genetic code]], there are three mRNA stop codons: UAG (\"amber\"), UAA (\"ochre\"), and UGA (\"opal\" or \"umber\"). Although these stop codons are triplets just like ordinary codons, they are not decoded by tRNAs. It was discovered by [[Mario Capecchi]] in 1967 that, instead, tRNAs do not ordinarily recognize stop codons at all, and that what he named \"release factor\" was not a tRNA molecule but a protein.<ref name=\"Capecchi_1967\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Capecchi MR | title = Polypeptide chain termination in vitro: isolation of a release factor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 1144\u201351 | date = September 1967 | pmid = 5233840 | pmc = 335760 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.58.3.1144| bibcode = 1967PNAS...58.1144C }}</ref> Later, it was demonstrated that different release factors recognize different stop codons.<ref name=\"Scolnick_1968\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scolnick E, Tompkins R, Caskey T, Nirenberg M | title = Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 768\u201374 | date = October 1968 | pmid = 4879404 | pmc = 225226 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.61.2.768| bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..768S }}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are two classes of release factors.

In the standard [[genetic code]], there are three mRNA stop codons: UAG (\"amber\"), UAA (\"ochre\"), and UGA (\"opal\" or \"umber\"). Although these stop codons are triplets just like ordinary codons, they are not decoded by tRNAs. It was discovered by [[Mario Capecchi]] in 1967 that, instead, tRNAs do not ordinarily recognize stop codons at all, and that what he named \"release factor\" was not a tRNA molecule but a protein.<ref name=\"Capecchi_1967\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Capecchi MR | title = Polypeptide chain termination in vitro: isolation of a release factor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 1144\u201351 | date = September 1967 | pmid = 5233840 | pmc = 335760 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.58.3.1144| bibcode = 1967PNAS...58.1144C }}</ref> Later, it was demonstrated that different release factors recognize different stop codons.<ref name=\"Scolnick_1968\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Scolnick E, Tompkins R, Caskey T, Nirenberg M | title = Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 768\u201374 | date = October 1968 | pmid = 4879404 | pmc = 225226 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.61.2.768| bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..768S }}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are two classes of release factors.

The group recorded for [[Columbia Records]]. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for [[Mercury Records]], called \"[[Here's That Rainy Day]]\", failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists [[Mickey Gilley]] and [[Eddy Arnold]].

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a major hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hit 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles.

Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]\u2014a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]\u2014was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"Crazy\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |publisher=[[Front Row King]]|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]\u2014\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991\u201394, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992\u201395, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, \"We've Got It All\", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===2000\u20132015===\n[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers in 2004]]\nIn the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with \"Hello Love\"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A\u2014Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.

Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums ''Every Time Two Fools Collide'' (No.&nbsp;1) and ''Classics'' (No.&nbsp;3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them.

Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: \"She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.\" In a 1978 press release for their album \"Every Time Two Fools Collide\", Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography \"Luck Or Something Like It\". In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the [[CBS]] biographical film ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]''.\n\nIn 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with [[Kim Carnes]], \"[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]\", became a major hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/2017-01-26/kenny-rogers-final-tour-retiring-includes-concert-thrasher-horne-saturday |title=Kenny Rogers' final tour before retiring includes concert at Thrasher-Horne on Saturday |author=Crumpler, David |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> Earlier that year, he sang a duet of \"You and Me\" with [[Lynda Carter]] in her television music special ''Lynda Carter Special'' (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the [[Every Time Two Fools Collide]] album).  Later in 1980 came his partnership with [[Lionel Richie]] who wrote and produced Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> Richie went on to produce Rogers' 1981 album ''Share Your Love,'' a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as \"[[I Don't Need You]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;3), \"[[Through the Years (Kenny Rogers song)|Through the Years]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;13), and \"[[Share Your Love with Me]]\" (Pop No.&nbsp;14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. In 1982, Rogers released the album ''[[Love Will Turn You Around]].'' The album's [[Love Will Turn You Around (song)|the title track]] reached No.&nbsp;13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hit 100]] and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers' 1982 film ''[[Six Pack (film)|Six Pack]]''. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer [[David Foster]] in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit [[Bob Seger]] [[cover version|cover]] \"[[We've Got Tonight]]\", a duet with [[Sheena Easton]]. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nIn 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles. The song \"[[We Are the World]]\" was recorded there and at [[Jim Henson Company Lot|A & M Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=kenny+rogers+lion+share+recording+studio#v=onepage|title=Rogers Buys Studio|last=McCullaugh|first=Jim|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=February 6, 1982|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nRogers went on to work with [[Barry Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] who produced his 1983 hit album ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]]'', featuring the title track and yet another No.&nbsp;1 hit \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet with [[Dolly Parton]]. Gibb, along with his brothers, Robin and Maurice, originally wrote the song for [[Marvin Gaye]] in an R&B style, only later to change it for Rogers' album.<ref>Johnny Walker interview with Robin and Barry Gibb BBC Radio 2 30 August 2010 17:00</ref> The partnership with Gibb only lasted one album, which was not surprising considering that Rogers' original intention was to work with Gibb on only one song. Gibb insisted on doing the entire album together.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\n\"Islands in the Stream\", Rogers' duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from ''Eyes That See in the Dark'' in the United States, and it quickly went to No.&nbsp;1 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No.&nbsp;1 on that chart until \"[[Amazed]]\" by [[Lonestar]] did so in 2000), as well as topping ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s country and adult contemporary singles charts;  it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, [[Once Upon a Christmas (Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton album)|''Once Upon a Christmas'']] and TV special ''Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember'' (which resulted in a popular video of \"Christmas Without You\"), as well as a 1985 duet \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\", which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single \"[[You Can't Make Old Friends]]\".<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nDespite the success of \"Islands in the Stream\", however, [[RCA Records]] insisted on releasing ''Eyes''{{'}} title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No.&nbsp;61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) \"Islands in the Stream\" was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No.&nbsp;7. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. \"Buried Treasure\", \"This Woman\" and \"Evening Star\"/\"Midsummer Nights\" were also all successful singles from the album.\n\nShortly after came the album ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'', a hit whose [[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|title track]]\u2014a trio performance with [[James Ingram]] and [[Kim Carnes]]\u2014was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]; the single \"Crazy\" (not to be confused with the [[Willie Nelson]]-penned [[Patsy Cline]] hit) topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album ''The Heart of the Matter,'' although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to [[George Martin]]. This album was another success, going to No.&nbsp;1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.\n\nThe next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including \"Twenty Years Ago\", \"Morning Desire\", \"Tomb of the Unknown Love\", among others.  On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song \"[[We Are the World]]\" to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.<ref name=\"Front Row King\">{{cite web|title=Kenny Rogers Concert Tickets |publisher=[[Front Row King]]|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/buy-kenny-rogers-concert-tickets/index.html|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for \"Best Country Collaboration with Vocals\" with [[Ronnie Milsap]]\u2014\"Make No Mistake, She's Mine\". In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as \"The Factory\" and \"Crazy In Love\", another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, \"If You Want To Find Love\", and \"The Greatest\". His second Christmas album, titled ''Christmas in America,'' was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991\u201394, Rogers hosted ''[[The Real West]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]], and on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992\u201395, Rogers co-owned and headlined [[Branson, Missouri]]'s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his \"dream\" album titled ''Timepiece'' on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/arts-and-entertainment/20161201/kenny-rogers-plans-to-fold-em-after-final-concert-tour |title=Kenny Rogers plans to fold 'em after final concert tour |author=Graff, Gary |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2017 |work=[[Oakland Press]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Rogers released an album ''Vote For Love'' where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC's record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by [[QVC]], was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK country charts under the title ''Love Songs'' (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.\n\nIn 1999, Rogers scored with the single \"The Greatest\", a song about life from a child's point of view (looked at through a baseball game)<ref name=RugbyIndependent2007 /> The song reached the top 40 of ''Billboard's'' Country singles chart and was a [[Country Music Television]] Number One video. It was on Rogers' album ''She Rides Wild Horses'' the following year (itself a top 10 success).<ref name=\"DeYoung\" /> In 1999, Rogers also produced a song, \"We've Got It All\", specifically for the series finale of the ABC show ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]].'' Not found on any album, the recording sells for a high sum at auction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===2000\u20132015===\n[[File:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|thumb|right|Rogers in 2004]]\nIn the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No.&nbsp;1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single \"[[Buy Me a Rose]]\".<ref name=cmt1304 /> In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by [[Hank Snow]] (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with \"Hello Love\"). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old [[Willie Nelson]] became the oldest artist to have a No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts with his duet with [[Toby Keith]], \"[[Beer for My Horses]]\".\n\nAlthough Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages.  In 2004 ''[[42 Ultimate Hits]]'', which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold.  It also featured two new songs, \"My World Is Over\" with [[Whitney Duncan]] and \"We Are the Same\".  \"My World Is Over\" was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 ''The Very Best of Kenny Rogers'', a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\nRogers also signed with [[Capitol Records]] and had more success with the TV advertised release ''21 Number Ones'' in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers' No.&nbsp;1 singles, omitting such singles as \"Crazy in Love\" and \"What About Me?\"\n\nCapitol followed ''21 Number Ones'' with Rogers' new studio album, ''[[Water & Bridges]]'', in March 2006 on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol Nashville Records]] label. The first single from the album was \"[[I Can't Unlove You]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. \"I Can't Unlove You\" was followed up with the second single from the album, \"The Last Ten Years (Superman)\", in September 2006. The third single, \"Calling Me\", which features [[Don Henley]], became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. Also in 2007, the 1977 ''Kenny Rogers'' album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 ''Kenny'' album and this once again put Rogers' name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (''A Love Song Collection'') also charted.<ref name=\"DeYoung\" />\n\nOn August 26, 2008, Rogers released ''50 Years''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kenny-rogers-celebrates-new-project-of-old-classics/336423|title=Kenny Rogers Q&A\u2014Celebrates New Project with Old Classics|publisher=AOL Music Canada|date=March 24, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores.

The chicken and [[ribs]] chain, which is similar to [[Boston Market]], was famously featured in an episode of the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' called \"[[The Chicken Roaster (Seinfeld episode)|The Chicken Roaster]]\". On the November 27, 1996, broadcast of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Rogers could not pick his chicken out in a taste test, claiming he preferred \"greasy burgers\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Season four of the TV series ''[[Fresh Off the Boat]]'' depicts the chain as owning a share of Louis Huang's Cattleman's Ranch restaurant and then filing for [[bankruptcy]].

K. Spurlock in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. The company used the name from Rogers' hit song ''The Gambler''. During the 1980s and 1990s, Gambler was one of the fastest and widely used Sprintcars with such drivers as [[Steve Kinser]], [[Sammy Swindell]] and Doug Wolfgang driving the cars to victory in the [[World of Outlaws]] and the famous [[Knoxville Nationals]]. Gambler sprintcars were also successful in Australia with drivers such as Garry Rush and Steve Brazier using Gamblers to win multiple [[Australian Sprintcar Championship]]s. Rush also used a Gambler chassis to win the UNOFFICIAL 1987 World Sprintcar Championship at the [[Claremont Speedway]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]].\n\nRogers appeared in a 2004 episode of ''[[Reno 911!]]'' as himself being subjected to incompetent security provided by starstruck sheriff's deputies to comical effect.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn October 2012, Rogers released a book ''Luck or Something Like it: A Memoir'' about his ups and downs in his musical career.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Joe|title=Book Review: Luck or Something Like It by Kenny Rogers|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Luck-or-Something-Like-It-by-Kenny-3897706.php|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=September 26, 2012}}</ref> With Mike Blakely, he has written a novel, ''What Are the Chances'', that was released September 1, 2013.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2014, Rogers appeared as himself in a [[GEICO]] commercial, singing part of his song \"[[The Gambler (song)|The Gambler]]\" a cappella while acting as the dealer in a card game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXl8oHlA5LM |title=GEICO \u2013 Did you know playing cards with Kenny Rogers gets old pretty fast?

categories, including [[Point (basketball)|points]], [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], [[Assist (basketball)|assists]], [[Steal (basketball)|steals]], and [[Block (basketball)|blocks]]. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders.

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\n\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983\u201384 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985\u201386 season, but Louisville's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.<ref name=SPLIT>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/overview/history.html |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic
