Within this context, both husband and wife are each other's protector and comforter, just as real garments \u201cshow and conceal\u201d the body of human beings. Thus, they are meant \u201cfor one another\u201d.<ref name=ZawajMir>Assadullah, Mir Mohmmed. [http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/mir.html Weddings in Islam], zawaj.com</ref> The Quran continues to discuss the matter of marriage and states, \"And among His Signs is this, that he created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between your [hearts]\u2026\".<ref>Quran 30: 21</ref> Marriages within the Muslim community are incredibly important. The purpose of marriage in Islamic culture is to preserve the religion through the creation of a family.

Young Muslim men and women are strongly encouraged to marry as soon as possible, since the family is recognized as the foundation of Islamic society.<ref name=\"International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family\" /> According to traditional Islamic law, women and men are not free to date or intermingle, which results in a more drawn-out and deliberate process.<ref name=\"International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family\" /><ref name=\"International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family\" /> The amount of choice and acceptance involved in choosing marriage partners often depends on the class and educational status of the family.<ref name=\"International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family\" /> Some important characteristics in choosing a worthy mate are faith and chastity. These traits are pointed out in Quran Chapter 33 Verse 35 \"For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient and for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in Allah's praise, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.\"<ref name=\"International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family\" />[[Forced marriage|\u2018Forced\u2019 marriages]], where consent has not been given by the bride, or is given only under excessive pressure, is considered illegal in all [[Madhhab|schools of Islamic law]]. Forced marriage is absolutely and explicitly forbidden.\n\nSince traditional Muslim societies are generally religiously homogeneous, it is much easier for individuals to find socially acceptable partners through traditional methods. Within these communities, families, friends, and services are used to help people find a significant other.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aziz|first=Taimoor|author2=Mbaye Lo|title=Muslim Marriage Goes Online: The Use of Internet Matchmaking by American Muslims|journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture|date=Fall 2009|volume=21|issue=3}}</ref>  However, in non-Muslim countries, like the United States, there is no universal method for matchmaking or finding a spouse. These Muslims must use alternate methods in order to find a partner in a way that closely simulates the traditional process.\n\nMuslims in non-Islamic countries like the [[United States]] use Islamic institutions or imams to help them find partners. Islamic institutions like the [[Islamic Society of North America|ISNA (Islamic Society of North America)]], [[Nation of Islam|NOI (Nation of Islam)]], [[Islamic Circle of North America|ICNA (Islamic Circle of North America)]], and MANA (Muslim Alliance of North America), allow individuals to meet others at annual conventions.<ref name=\"Muslim Marriage Goes Online: the Use of Internet Matchmaking by American Muslims\">{{cite journal|last=Aziz and Lo|journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture|year=2009}}</ref>  The imam is a valued source among these Muslim communities as well.

When it comes to Muslim weddings the culture they come from heavily influences the kind of rituals that will take place. Similarly American-Muslims e.g. [[African-Americans]], [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], Hispanics and others have elements of both local, and Muslim influence.\nThe central event in all American-Muslim Weddings will be the [[Nikah]]. This is the actual wedding ceremony, usually officiated by a Muslim cleric, an Imam. Although a Nikah can be done anywhere including the bride's home or reception hall, it is preferable and usually done in a mosque. \n<ref name=\"Perfect Muslim Wedding\"/>\n\nA Muslim Wedding Survey of North American Muslims, revealed among other things the merger of two or more cultures.

Their customary and legal matrimony is composed of negotiated [[arranged marriage]] (''pagpangasawa''), marriage through the \u201c[[game]] of [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]]\u201d (''pagsaggau''), and [[elopement]] (''pagdakup'').<ref name=Tausug1>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/tausag/tausag1.html Philippine Muslim (Tausug) Marriages on Jolo Island, Part One: Courtship], zawaj.com</ref> Furthermore, although Tausug men may acquire two wives, bigamous or plural marriages are rare.<ref name=Tausug1/>\n\n[[File:Tausug.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]] lady performing the traditional ''[[pangalay]]'' dance.]]\nTausug matrimonial customs generally include the negotiation and proclamation of the [[bridewealth]] (the ''ungsud'') which is a composition of the \u201cvaluables for the offspring\u201d or ''dalaham pagapusan'' (in the form of money or an animal that cannot be slaughtered for the marital feast); the \"valuables dropped in the ocean\" or ''dalaham hug a tawid'', which are intended for the father of the bride; the ''basingan'' which is a payment \u2013 in the form of antique gold or silver [[Spain|Spanish]] or [[United States|American]] coins \u2013 for the transference of kingship rights toward the ''usba'' or \u201cmale side\u201d; the \u201cpayment to the treasury\u201d (''sikawin baytal-mal'', a payment to officers of the law and wedding officiants); the wedding musicians and performers; wedding feast costs; and the guiding [[Filipino proverb|proverb]] that says a lad should marry by the time he has already personally farmed for a period of three years.

This is the ideal, esteemed, and considered \u201cmost proper\u201d in the legal point of view of Tausug culture, despite of being a time-consuming and costly practice for the groom.  If the parents disagree with their son's choice of a woman to marry, he might decide to resort to a marriage by abducting the woman of his choice, run away, run amuck, or choose to become an outlaw.  In relation to this type of marriage, another trait that is considered ideal in Tausug marriage is to wed sons and daughters with first or second cousins, due to the absence of difficulty in negotiating and simplification of land inheritance discussions.<ref name=Tausug1/>  However, there is also another way of arranging a Tausug marriage, which is through the establishment of ''maglillah pa maas sing babai'' or by \u201csurrendering to the lady\u2019s parents\u201d, wherein the lad proclaims his intention while at the house of the parents of the woman of his choice; he will not depart until he receives permission to marry.  In other circumstances, the lad offers a sum of money to the parents of the lass; a refusal by the father and mother of the woman would mean paying a fine or doubling the price offered by the negotiating man.<ref name=Tausug2/>\n\n\u201cAbduction-game marriages\u201d are characteristically in accord with the grooms\u2019 requests, and are performed either by force or \u201clegal fiction\u201d.<ref name=Tausug1/>  This strategy of marrying a woman is actually a \u201c[[courtship]] game\u201d that expresses a Tausug man's masculinity and bravery.

Bridal preparation is done by women by anointing the body of the bride with oil, application of perfumes to the bride's hair, use of creams, feeding the bride with special dishes, washing the bride's hair with amber and jasmine extracts, use of the [[Arab World|Arabian]] ''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]]'' or Arabian [[eye liner]], and decorating the hands and feet with henna (a ritual known as the ''Laylat Al Henna'' or \u201chenna night\u201d or \"night of henna\", and performed a few days before being wed; during this evening, other members of the bride's family and guests also place henna over their own hands).  The Emirati bride stays at her dwelling for forty days until the marriage night, only to be visited by her family.  Later, the groom offers her items that she will use to create the ''Addahbia'', a dowry which is composed of jewelry, perfumes, and silk, among others.<ref name=UAE>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/uae.html Weddings In The U.A.E.], zawaj.com</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn [[Dubai]], one of [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|the seven emirates]] of the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], the traditional [[Bedouin]] wedding is a ceremonial that echoes the earliest Arab concept of [[matrimony]], which emphasizes that marital union is not simply a joining together of a man and a woman but the coming together of two families.  Traditionally lasting for seven days, Bedouin marriage preparations and celebration starts with the marriage proposal known as the ''Al Khoutha'', a meeting of the groom's father and bride's father; the purpose of the groom's father is to ask the hand of the bride from the bride's father for marriage; and involves the customary drinking of minty [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] [[tea]].  After this, the negotiating families proceed with the ''Al Akhd'', a marriage contract agreement.  The bride goes through the ritual of a \u201c[[bridal shower]]\u201d known as ''Laylat Al Henna'', the henna tattooing of the bride's hands and feet, a service signifying attractiveness, fortune, and healthiness.  The ''Al Aadaa'' follows, a groom-teasing rite done by the friends of the bride wherein they ask compensation after embellishing the bride with henna.  The ceremonial also involves a family [[procession]] towards the bride's home, a re-enactment of a [[war dance]] known as ''Al Ardha'', and the ''Zaahbaah'' or the displaying of the bride's garments and the gifts she received from her groom's family.  In the earliest versions of Bedouin wedding ceremonies, the groom and the bride goes and stays within a [[tent]] made of [[camel]] hair, and that the bride is not to be viewed in public during the nuptial proceedings.  The wedding concludes with the ''Tarwaah'', when the bride rides a [[camel]] towards her new home to live with her husband.  After a week, the bride will have a reunion with her own family.  Customarily, the groom will not be able to join his bride until the formal wedding procedure ended.  The only place where they will finally see each other is at their post-wedding dwelling.<ref name=Bed/>\n\nEstablished Bedouin wedding customs also entail the use of hand-embroidered costumes, the dowry, and the bridewealth.  Islamic law dictates that the jewelry received by the bride becomes her personal property.<ref name=Bed>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/bedouin_color.html Muslim Bedouin Weddings: a Riot of Color and Music], zawaj.com, April 19, 2001</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Bridal Outfit ==\nIndian Brides traditionally wear a yellow formal outfit, and apply wet Mehendi on their hands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wedamor.com/brides-of-india/|title=Brides Of India - WedAmor|work=WedAmor|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Fiqh |marital}}\n* [[Islamic marriage contract]]\n* [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]]\n* [[Minangkabau marriage]] \u2014  West Sumatra, Indonesia.\n* [[Pakistani wedding]]\n* [[Persian marriage]]\n* [[Punjabi wedding traditions]]\n* [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]] \u2014 India\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marriage in Islam]]\n[[Category:Islamic culture]]\n[[Category:Weddings by religion]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2010}}\n[[File:Newly married couple from Dhaka June 2014 01.JPG|thumb|280px|A portrait of newly married couple from [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] in 2014]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sundanese bruiloft in een moskee TMnr 20017927.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] wedding ceremony held inside a [[mosque]] in [[West Java]], [[Indonesia]] in 1977.]]\n[[File:The marriage procession of Dara Shikoh - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The [[Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] attends the marriage procession of his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]].

This is the ideal, esteemed, and considered \u201cmost proper\u201d in the legal point of view of Tausug culture, despite of being a time-consuming and costly practice for the groom.  If the parents disagree with their son's choice of a woman to marry, he might decide to resort to a marriage by abducting the woman of his choice, run away, run amuck, or choose to become an outlaw.  In relation to this type of marriage, another trait that is considered ideal in Tausug marriage is to wed sons and daughters with first or second cousins, due to the absence of difficulty in negotiating and simplification of land inheritance discussions.<ref name=Tausug1/>  However, there is also another way of arranging a Tausug marriage, which is through the establishment of ''maglillah pa maas sing babai'' or by \u201csurrendering to the lady\u2019s parents\u201d, wherein the lad proclaims his intention while at the house of the parents of the woman of his choice; he will not depart until he receives permission to marry.  In other circumstances, the lad offers a sum of money to the parents of the lass; a refusal by the father and mother of the woman would mean paying a fine or doubling the price offered by the negotiating man.<ref name=Tausug2/>\n\n\u201cAbduction-game marriages\u201d are characteristically in accord with the grooms\u2019 requests, and are performed either by force or \u201clegal fiction\u201d.<ref name=Tausug1/>  This strategy of marrying a woman is actually a \u201c[[courtship]] game\u201d that expresses a Tausug man's masculinity and bravery.  Although the woman has the right to refuse marrying her \u201cabductor\u201d, reluctance and refusal does not always endure because the man will resort to seducing the \u201cabductee\u201d.  In the case of marriages done through the game of abduction, the bridewealth offered is a gesticulation to appease the woman's parents.<ref name=Tausug1/>\n\nElopements are normally based on the brides\u2019 desires, which may, at times, are made to resemble a \u201cbride kidnapping\u201d situation (i.e. a marriage through the game of abduction) in order to prevent dishonoring the woman who wished to be eloped.<ref name=Tausug1/>  One way of eloping is known to the Tausugs as ''muuy magbana'' or the \"homecoming to get hold of a husband\", wherein a Tausug woman offers herself to the man of her choice or to the parents of the man who she wants to become her spouse.  Elopement is also a strategy used by female Tausugs in order to be able to enter into a second marriage, or done by an older unwed lady by seducing a man who is younger than her.<ref name=Tausug3>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/tausag/tausag3.html Philippine Muslim (Tausug) Marriages on Jolo Island, Part Three: Abduction and Elopement], zawaj.com</ref>\n\nDuring the [[engagement]] period, the man may render service to his bride's parents in the form of performing household chores.<ref name=Tausug4>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/tausag/tausag4.html Philippine Muslim (Tausug) Marriages on Jolo Island, Part Four: Weddings and Divorces], zawaj.com</ref> After the period of engagement has lapsed, the marital-union ceremony is observed by feastings, delivery of the whole bridewealth, slaughtering of a [[carabao]] or a [[cow]], playing [[gong]]s and native [[xylophone]]s, reciting prayers in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Tausug language]]s, symbolic touching by the groom of his bride's forehead, and the couple's emotionless sitting-together ritual.

Bridal preparation is done by women by anointing the body of the bride with oil, application of perfumes to the bride's hair, use of creams, feeding the bride with special dishes, washing the bride's hair with amber and jasmine extracts, use of the [[Arab World|Arabian]] ''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]]'' or Arabian [[eye liner]], and decorating the hands and feet with henna (a ritual known as the ''Laylat Al Henna'' or \u201chenna night\u201d or \"night of henna\", and performed a few days before being wed; during this evening, other members of the bride's family and guests also place henna over their own hands).  The Emirati bride stays at her dwelling for forty days until the marriage night, only to be visited by her family.  Later, the groom offers her items that she will use to create the ''Addahbia'', a dowry which is composed of jewelry, perfumes, and silk, among others.<ref name=UAE>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/uae.html Weddings In The U.A.E.], zawaj.com</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn [[Dubai]], one of [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|the seven emirates]] of the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], the traditional [[Bedouin]] wedding is a ceremonial that echoes the earliest Arab concept of [[matrimony]], which emphasizes that marital union is not simply a joining together of a man and a woman but the coming together of two families.  Traditionally lasting for seven days, Bedouin marriage preparations and celebration starts with the marriage proposal known as the ''Al Khoutha'', a meeting of the groom's father and bride's father; the purpose of the groom's father is to ask the hand of the bride from the bride's father for marriage; and involves the customary drinking of minty [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] [[tea]].  After this, the negotiating families proceed with the ''Al Akhd'', a marriage contract agreement.  The bride goes through the ritual of a \u201c[[bridal shower]]\u201d known as ''Laylat Al Henna'', the henna tattooing of the bride's hands and feet, a service signifying attractiveness, fortune, and healthiness.  The ''Al Aadaa'' follows, a groom-teasing rite done by the friends of the bride wherein they ask compensation after embellishing the bride with henna.  The ceremonial also involves a family [[procession]] towards the bride's home, a re-enactment of a [[war dance]] known as ''Al Ardha'', and the ''Zaahbaah'' or the displaying of the bride's garments and the gifts she received from her groom's family.  In the earliest versions of Bedouin wedding ceremonies, the groom and the bride goes and stays within a [[tent]] made of [[camel]] hair, and that the bride is not to be viewed in public during the nuptial proceedings.  The wedding concludes with the ''Tarwaah'', when the bride rides a [[camel]] towards her new home to live with her husband.  After a week, the bride will have a reunion with her own family.  Customarily, the groom will not be able to join his bride until the formal wedding procedure ended.  The only place where they will finally see each other is at their post-wedding dwelling.<ref name=Bed/>\n\nEstablished Bedouin wedding customs also entail the use of hand-embroidered costumes, the dowry, and the bridewealth.  Islamic law dictates that the jewelry received by the bride becomes her personal property.<ref name=Bed>[http://www.zawaj.com/weddingways/bedouin_color.html Muslim Bedouin Weddings: a Riot of Color and Music], zawaj.com, April 19, 2001</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Bridal Outfit ==\nIndian Brides traditionally wear a yellow formal outfit, and apply wet Mehendi on their hands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wedamor.com/brides-of-india/|title=Brides Of India - WedAmor|work=WedAmor|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Fiqh |marital}}\n* [[Islamic marriage contract]]\n* [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]]\n* [[Minangkabau marriage]] \u2014  West Sumatra, Indonesia.\n* [[Pakistani wedding]]\n* [[Persian marriage]]\n* [[Punjabi wedding traditions]]\n* [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]] \u2014 India\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marriage in Islam]]\n[[Category:Islamic culture]]\n[[Category:Weddings by religion]]\n", "name_user": "2600:387:a:5::1d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added new content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_marital_practices"}

The western end of La Braye is now Le Grand Havre.

Guernsey may not apply different immigration controls to the UK.\n\n===Housing restrictions===\nGuernsey undertakes a population management mechanism using restrictions over who may work in the island through control of which properties people may live in. The housing market is split between ''local market'' properties and a set number of ''open market'' properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |title=Guernsey's Two Tier Housing Market |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419235752/http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |archivedate=19 April 2015  }}</ref> Anyone may live in an open market property, but local market properties can only be lived in by those who qualify \u2013 either through being born in Guernsey (to at least one local parent), by obtaining a housing licence, or by virtue of sharing a property with someone who does qualify (living ''en famille''). Consequently, ''open market'' properties are much more expensive both to buy and to rent. Housing licences are for fixed periods, often only valid for 4 years and only as long as the individual remains employed by a specified Guernsey employer. The licence will specify the type of accommodation and be specific to the address the person lives in,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/live |title=Where can licence holders live |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501145835/http://www.gov.gg/live |archivedate=1 May 2015  }}</ref> and is often subject to a police record check. These restrictions apply equally regardless of whether the property is owned or rented, and only apply to occupation of the property. Thus a person whose housing licence expires may continue to own a Guernsey property, but will no longer be able to live in it. There are no restrictions on who may own a property.\n\n[[File:Guernsey July 2010 92.jpg|thumb|Coast of Guernsey]]\nThere are a number of routes to qualifying as a \"local\" for housing purposes. Generally, it is sufficient to be born to at least one Guernsey parent and to live in the island for ten years in a twenty-year period. In a similar way a partner (married or otherwise) of a local can acquire local status. Multiple problems arise following early separation of couples, especially if they have young children or if a local partner dies, in these situations personal circumstances and compassion can add weight to requests for local status. Once \"local\" status has been achieved it remains in place for life. Even a lengthy period of residence outside Guernsey does not invalidate \"local\" housing status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |title=What is a Qualified Resident? |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414221632/http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |archivedate=14 April 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Guernsey's inhabitants are full [[British nationality law|British citizens]],<ref>{{cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1981| chapter = 61| act = British Nationality Act 1981}}</ref> an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in other European Union states is placed in the passport of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and [[Isle of Man]].

The Department has completed the building of Le Rondin special needs school, the Sixth Form Centre at the Grammar School and the first phase of the new College of Further Education \u2013 a performing arts centre. The construction of St Sampsons High was completed summer 2008 and admitted its first pupils in September 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the school leaving age was raised so the earliest date is the last Friday in June in the year a pupil turns 16, in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means pupils will be between 15 and 10 months and 16 and 10 months before being able to leave. Prior to this, pupils could leave school at the end of the term in which they turned 14, if they so wished: a letter was required to be sent to the Education department to confirm this. However, this option was undertaken by relatively few pupils, the majority choosing to complete their GCSEs and then either begin employment or continue their education.\n\nPost-[[GCSE]] pupils have a choice of transferring to the state-run [[Guernsey Grammar School and Sixth Form Centre|Grammar School & Sixth Form Centre]], or to the independent colleges for academic AS/A Levels/International Baccalureate Diploma Programme. They also have the option to study vocational subjects at the island's ''Guernsey College of Further Education''.\n\nThere are no universities in the island. Students who attend university in the United Kingdom receive state support towards both maintenance and tuition fees. In 2007, the Education Department received the approval of the States Assembly to introduce student contributions to the costs of higher education, in the form of student loans, as apply in the UK. However, immediately after the general election of 2008, the States Assembly voted in favour of a [[Private member's bill|Requ\u00eate]] which proposed abolishing the student loans scheme on the grounds that it was expensive to run and would potentially discourage students from going to, and then returning to the island from, university. In 2012, the Education Department reported to the States Assembly that it had no need to re-examine the basis of higher education funding at the present time.\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{main|Culture of Guernsey}}\n\n[[File:George M\u00e9tivier.jpg|thumb|left|[[George M\u00e9tivier]]]]\nEnglish is the language in general use by the majority of the population, while [[Guern\u00e9siais]], the [[Norman language]] of the island, is spoken fluently by only about 2% of the population (according to 2001 census). However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language. Until the early 20th-century French was the only official language of the Bailiwick, and all deeds for the sale and purchase of real estate in Guernsey were written in French until 1971. Family and place names reflect this linguistic heritage. [[George M\u00e9tivier]], a poet, wrote in Guernesiais. The loss of the island's language and the Anglicisation of its culture, which began in the 19th century and proceeded inexorably for a century, accelerated sharply when the majority of the island's school children were evacuated to the UK for five years during the German occupation of 1940\u201345.\n\n[[File:Renoir16.jpg|thumb|''Children on the Beach of Guernsey'' (1883) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]\nThe French [[impressionist]] painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] visited the island in late summer 1883.

Guernsey may not apply different immigration controls to the UK.\n\n===Housing restrictions===\nGuernsey undertakes a population management mechanism using restrictions over who may work in the island through control of which properties people may live in. The housing market is split between ''local market'' properties and a set number of ''open market'' properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |title=Guernsey's Two Tier Housing Market |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419235752/http://www.gov.gg/twotierhousingmarket |archivedate=19 April 2015  }}</ref> Anyone may live in an open market property, but local market properties can only be lived in by those who qualify \u2013 either through being born in Guernsey (to at least one local parent), by obtaining a housing licence, or by virtue of sharing a property with someone who does qualify (living ''en famille''). Consequently, ''open market'' properties are much more expensive both to buy and to rent. Housing licences are for fixed periods, often only valid for 4 years and only as long as the individual remains employed by a specified Guernsey employer. The licence will specify the type of accommodation and be specific to the address the person lives in,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/live |title=Where can licence holders live |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501145835/http://www.gov.gg/live |archivedate=1 May 2015  }}</ref> and is often subject to a police record check. These restrictions apply equally regardless of whether the property is owned or rented, and only apply to occupation of the property. Thus a person whose housing licence expires may continue to own a Guernsey property, but will no longer be able to live in it. There are no restrictions on who may own a property.\n\n[[File:Guernsey July 2010 92.jpg|thumb|Coast of Guernsey]]\nThere are a number of routes to qualifying as a \"local\" for housing purposes. Generally, it is sufficient to be born to at least one Guernsey parent and to live in the island for ten years in a twenty-year period. In a similar way a partner (married or otherwise) of a local can acquire local status. Multiple problems arise following early separation of couples, especially if they have young children or if a local partner dies, in these situations personal circumstances and compassion can add weight to requests for local status. Once \"local\" status has been achieved it remains in place for life. Even a lengthy period of residence outside Guernsey does not invalidate \"local\" housing status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |title=What is a Qualified Resident? |publisher=States of Guernsey |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414221632/http://www.gov.gg/qualifiedresident |archivedate=14 April 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAlthough Guernsey's inhabitants are full [[British nationality law|British citizens]],<ref>{{cite legislation UK | type = act | year = 1981| chapter = 61| act = British Nationality Act 1981}}</ref> an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in other European Union states is placed in the passport of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and [[Isle of Man]].

The Department has completed the building of Le Rondin special needs school, the Sixth Form Centre at the Grammar School and the first phase of the new College of Further Education \u2013 a performing arts centre. The construction of St Sampsons High was completed summer 2008 and admitted its first pupils in September 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the school leaving age was raised so the earliest date is the last Friday in June in the year a pupil turns 16, in line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This means pupils will be between 15 and 10 months and 16 and 10 months before being able to leave. Prior to this, pupils could leave school at the end of the term in which they turned 14, if they so wished: a letter was required to be sent to the Education department to confirm this. However, this option was undertaken by relatively few pupils, the majority choosing to complete their GCSEs and then either begin employment or continue their education.\n\nPost-[[GCSE]] pupils have a choice of transferring to the state-run [[Guernsey Grammar School and Sixth Form Centre|Grammar School & Sixth Form Centre]], or to the independent colleges for academic AS/A Levels/International Baccalureate Diploma Programme. They also have the option to study vocational subjects at the island's ''Guernsey College of Further Education''.\n\nThere are no universities in the island. Students who attend university in the United Kingdom receive state support towards both maintenance and tuition fees. In 2007, the Education Department received the approval of the States Assembly to introduce student contributions to the costs of higher education, in the form of student loans, as apply in the UK. However, immediately after the general election of 2008, the States Assembly voted in favour of a [[Private member's bill|Requ\u00eate]] which proposed abolishing the student loans scheme on the grounds that it was expensive to run and would potentially discourage students from going to, and then returning to the island from, university. In 2012, the Education Department reported to the States Assembly that it had no need to re-examine the basis of higher education funding at the present time.\n\n==Culture==\n\n{{main|Culture of Guernsey}}\n\n[[File:George M\u00e9tivier.jpg|thumb|left|[[George M\u00e9tivier]]]]\nEnglish is the language in general use by the majority of the population, while [[Guern\u00e9siais]], the [[Norman language]] of the island, is spoken fluently by only about 2% of the population (according to 2001 census). However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language. Until the early 20th-century French was the only official language of the Bailiwick, and all deeds for the sale and purchase of real estate in Guernsey were written in French until 1971. Family and place names reflect this linguistic heritage. [[George M\u00e9tivier]], a poet, wrote in Guernesiais. The loss of the island's language and the Anglicisation of its culture, which began in the 19th century and proceeded inexorably for a century, accelerated sharply when the majority of the island's school children were evacuated to the UK for five years during the German occupation of 1940\u201345.\n\n[[File:Renoir16.jpg|thumb|''Children on the Beach of Guernsey'' (1883) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]\nThe French [[impressionist]] painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] visited the island in late summer 1883.

That year, members of a fur-trapping party led by [[Peter Skene Ogden]] visited the area. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], [[John Strong Newberry]], and other Army [[Surveying|survey]] parties came next. Then pioneers heading farther west passed through the area and forded the Deschutes River at Farewell Bend.\n\nConstructed in May 1901, the Pilot Butte Development Company's little plant was the first commercial sawmill in Bend. The original location was at the rear of the Pilot Butte Inn of later years. Steidl and Reed also set up a small mill in Bend in 1903.

That year, members of a fur-trapping party led by [[Peter Skene Ogden]] visited the area. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], [[John Strong Newberry]], and other Army [[Surveying|survey]] parties came next. Then pioneers heading farther west passed through the area and forded the Deschutes River at Farewell Bend.\n\nConstructed in May 1901, the Pilot Butte Development Company's little plant was the first commercial sawmill in Bend. The original location was at the rear of the Pilot Butte Inn of later years. Steidl and Reed also set up a small mill in Bend in 1903. This was on the Deschutes River just below the Pioneer Park area. The mill was operated by water power.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Visitor Information Service\n| author = Phil F.

On January&nbsp;4, 1905, the city held its first official meeting as an incorporated [[municipality]], appointing A. H. Goodwillie as the first mayor. The settlement was originally called \"Farewell Bend\", which was later shortened to \"Bend\" by the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Postal Service]].\n\nIn 1910, [[Mirror Pond]] was created by the construction of the Bend Water, Light & Power Company dam on the Deschutes River in Bend.

The idea of PHA group was based on the work done by Banister and [[Oliver Zangwill|Zangwill]] (1941), and the PHF group was built on the research results of O\u2019Connor, Moulin, and Conway (2007).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Connor|first=Akira R.|last2=Moulin|first2=Chris J.

After completing the puzzle, each participant in the PHA group received a posthypnotic amnesia suggestion to forget the game in the hypnosis. On the other hand, each participant in the PHF group was not given the puzzle but received a posthypnotic familiarity suggestion that they would feel familiar with this game during the hypnosis. After the hypnosis, all participants were asked to play the puzzle (the second time for PHA group) and reported the feelings of playing.\n\nIn the PHA condition, if a participant reported no memory of completing the puzzle game during hypnosis, researchers scored the participant as passing the suggestion. In the PHF condition, if participants reported that the puzzle game felt familiar, researchers would score the participant as passing the suggestion. It turns out that, both in the PHA and PHF conditions, 5 participants passed the suggestion and 1 did not, which is 83.33% of the total sample.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Akira R.|last2=Barnier|first2=Amanda J.|last3=Cox|first3=Rochelle E.|date=2008-09-02|title=D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu in the Laboratory: A Behavioral and Experiential Comparison of Posthypnotic Amnesia and Posthypnotic Familiarity|journal=International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis|volume=56|issue=4|pages=425\u2013450|doi=10.1080/00207140802255450|issn=0020-7144|pmid=18726806|hdl=10023/1647|hdl-access=free}}</ref> More participants in PHF group felt strong sense of familiarity, for instance, commenting like \u201cI think I have done this several years ago\u201d. Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for example, describing like \u201cI think I have done the exact puzzle before.\u201d Only 3 out of 6 participants in PHA group felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill\u2019s findings. Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia. Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching. In contrast, participants in PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle but the feeling of play it just sliding across their mind. Overall, the experiences of participants in PHF group is more likely to be the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in life, while the experiences of participants in PHA group is unlike to be the real d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \n\nA 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experience.<ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\"/><ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\">{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969\u2013975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}</ref> When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect\u2014that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.\n\n'''Cryptomnesia: Reconstruction of a memory'''\n\nAnother possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is the occurrence of \"[[cryptomnesia]]\", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu''\". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'') involves achieving a good \"match\" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we \"know\" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Dual neurological processing'''\n\nIn 1964, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=403\u2013424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|doi=10.1093/brain/86.3.403}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Dream-based explanation===\nDreams can also be used to explain the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). 20% of the respondents reported their d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported that from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.  Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu during a dream state, which links d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with dream frequency.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===''Jamais vu''===\n{{Main|Jamais vu }}\n\n''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.\n\nOften described as the opposite of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].\n\nTheoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.<ref name=\"moulin\"/> If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalization]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization (or [[surreality]]) feelings.\n\nThe feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.<ref name=\"moulin\">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

Furthermore, more participants in PHF group experienced a strong d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for example, describing like \u201cI think I have done the exact puzzle before.\u201d Only 3 out of 6 participants in PHA group felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and none of them experienced a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. These figures are consistent with Banister and Zangwill\u2019s findings. Some participants in PHA group related the familiarity when completing the puzzle with an exact event that happened before, which is more likely to be a phenomenon of source amnesia. Other participants started to realize that they may have completed the puzzle game during hypnosis, which is more akin to the phenomenon of breaching. In contrast, participants in PHF group reported that they felt confused about the strong familiarity of this puzzle but the feeling of play it just sliding across their mind. Overall, the experiences of participants in PHF group is more likely to be the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in life, while the experiences of participants in PHA group is unlike to be the real d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \n\nA 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' experience.<ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\"/><ref name=\"Cleary et al., 2012\">{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969\u2013975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}</ref> When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect\u2014that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.\n\n'''Cryptomnesia: Reconstruction of a memory'''\n\nAnother possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is the occurrence of \"[[cryptomnesia]]\", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as \"''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu''\". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'') involves achieving a good \"match\" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we \"know\" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|encyclopedia=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Dual neurological processing'''\n\nIn 1964, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|issue=3|pages=403\u2013424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|doi=10.1093/brain/86.3.403}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Dream-based explanation===\nDreams can also be used to explain the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and they are related in three different aspects. Firstly, some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences duplicate the situation in dreams instead of waking conditions, according to the survey done by Brown (2004). 20% of the respondents reported their d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences were from dreams and 40% of the respondents reported that from both reality and dreams. Secondly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu because some elements in their remembered dreams were shown.  Research done by Zuger (1966) supported this idea by investigating the relationship between remembered dreams and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experiences, and suggested that there is a strong correlation. Thirdly, people may experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu during a dream state, which links d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with dream frequency.\n\n==Related terms==\n\n===''Jamais vu''===\n{{Main|Jamais vu }}\n\n''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning \"never seen\") is any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.\n\nOften described as the opposite of ''d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].\n\nTheoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.<ref name=\"moulin\"/> If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalization]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization (or [[surreality]]) feelings.\n\nThe feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word.<ref name=\"moulin\">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .
