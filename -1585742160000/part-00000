{"title_page": "Nicholas Nugent", "text_new": "{{short description|Anglo-Irish judge}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Nicholas Nugent''' (c. 1525\u20131582) was an Anglo-Irish judge, who was hanged for [[treason]] by the government that appointed him. He  had, before his downfall, enjoyed  a highly successful career, holding office as [[Solicitor General for Ireland]], Baron of the Irish [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)|Court of Exchequer]], and [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]], but  he was ruined by the [[rebellion]] of his nephew [[William Nugent]], which he was accused of supporting.\n\n== Background and early career ==\nNicholas Nugent was born between 1525 and 1530. Like many Irish judges of the time he belonged to the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocracy of [[the Pale]]. His father Sir Christopher Nugent (died 1531) was the son and heir of Richard Nugent, 4th [[Baron Delvin]]; his mother was Marian St Lawrence, daughter of [[Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 213</ref> His father predeceased his grandfather and the title passed to Nicholas' elder brother Richard, who died in 1559,  leaving two sons: [[Christopher Nugent]], the sixth Baron, and William. His mother made two further marriages: her second husband was Sir Gerald FitzGerald, Knight Marshal of Ireland, and  after his death she married thirdly John Parker, who was a  senior  judge and a key figure in the Dublin administration.\n\nNicholas married Janet Plunket, daughter of Sir [[John Plunket]], [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]] and his second   wife Catherine Luttrell, and widow of Thomas Marward, titular [[Baron Skryne]]; they had one surviving son, Richard. Nicholas  was given  the wardship of his step-daughter, who was  also named Janet. The younger Janet was a considerable  heiress and Nicholas wished her to marry his nephew William; the marriage took place but only after William caused a scandal by [[kidnapping|abducting]]   her.<ref>Ball, p.213</ref>\n\nNicholas entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1558. His future rival  for judicial office, Sir  [[Robert Dillon (judge)|Robert Dillon]],  was there at the same time and their lifelong enmity seems to have begun when they were students: in 1560 they were ordered  by the Benchers of the Inn to stop fighting and [[bound over]]  to keep the peace.<ref>Crawford, Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.107</ref>\n\n== Later career ==\nOn his return to Ireland, Nugent advanced rapidly in his career: he was made Solicitor General for Ireland in 1565, elevated to the bench as Baron of the Exchequer, and recommended for the office of  [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], which had been held for many years by his stepfather, [[John Parker (Irish judge)|John Parker]].<ref>Ball p.213</ref> His irascible temper, so evident when he was a student, did not improve, and in 1576 another High Court judge, [[Richard Talbot (Irish judge)|Richard Talbot]], sued him before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] (the Irish equivalent of  [[Star Chamber]]) for [[riot]] and [[unlawful assembly]]; the charges were dismissed for lack of  sufficient evidence.<ref>Crawford p.214</ref>\n\nHis career suffered a further check when he joined in the ''cess'' controversy, which involved  a concerted  policy of opposition  by the landowning class to the taxation policies of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Sir [[Henry Sidney]]. He was twice suspended from office in 1577\u201378 and imprisoned, but was restored to favour after making his submission. The controversy does not seem to have  created any serious concerns  about his loyalty, no doubt because many eminent lawyers opposed the cess. Even  the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], had doubts about the wisdom of Sidney's taxation policy, as ultimately did the Queen herself.  Gerard thought highly of Nugent, and it was on his recommendation that he was made Chief Justice in 1580.<ref>Ball, p.146</ref> Within little over a year, however, the actions of his nephews brought about his downfall.\n\nThe loyalty of both  his nephews  to [[Elizabeth I]] was deeply suspect:  Lord Delvin was to die in prison awaiting trial in 1602 and, while William was eventually pardoned, this came too late to save his uncle. Both were suspected of supporting the rebellion of [[James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass]], and when William was exempted from the general pardon after the rebellion, he took up arms. Nicholas'  lifelong enemy, Sir Robert Dillon, who had been passed over as Chief Justice in Nugent's favour, went to [[London]] and evidently persuaded the Crown to suspend Nicholas from office as a suspected [[traitor]], an action which public opinion in Ireland attributed to  Dillon's spite and envy.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref>\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nThe Lord Deputy, [[Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton]], has been described as seeing his role of Deputy as \"a largely military one\". Perhaps for this reason the unusual decision was taken to conduct Nugent's trial, for treason, in a manner which, according to critical historians, \"had the appearance of [[martial law]].\"    It was held in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], rather than Dublin, allegedly for convenience, and Grey appointed a special commission to assist him, which included Sir Robert Dillon, his cousin the Chief Baron [[Lucas Dillon]], and [[Richard Segrave]], who had replaced Nugent at the  Court of Exchequer. In contrast to the modern view that judges should come to a case without bias, these men seem to have been chosen precisely because they knew Nugent personally. He  did however  have the benefit of [[trial by jury]] in the normal way.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref>\n\nThe law then required  two witnesses to an act of treason,  but at Nugent's trial only one witness,  John Cusack, appeared to testify that Nugent   knew of and encouraged William's rebellion.<ref>Crawford, pp.237\u20138</ref> Nugent, like all those charged with treason in Ireland  until the  middle of the  eighteenth century, was denied  the right to [[legal counsel]],<ref>The right was not granted in England  until 1695 by the [[Treason Act 1695]], nor  Ireland until 1765, under the [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1765]].</ref> but given his own legal expertise this was presumably less of a difficulty for him than it would have been for a layman, and he conducted his own defence with great spirit.    He accused Robert Dillon of having bribed Cusack to commit [[perjury]], and it seems that much of the trial was taken up by Dillon defending himself against charges of misconduct. To bolster the evidence, Grey claimed that Nicholas had privately confessed his guilt to Mr Waterhouse, a royal clerk. Whether or not the judges came to the trial with their minds made up, they seem to have had little doubt as to the verdict which the jury should bring in.\n\nNugent was found guilty, and hanged at Trim on 13 April.<ref>Crawford p.238</ref> There were claims that the jury were coerced by the judges, which is likely enough.  [[John Philipps Kenyon]] writes that until the 1670s  it  was considered quite proper for a judge to bring strong pressure  on a jury to find the \"right\" verdict (i.e. guilty),  and the practice of  a judge  \"suggesting\" that the   jury  bring in the required verdict continued into the  1690s.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.  ''The Stuart Constitution''  Cambridge University Press 2nd Edition 1986 pp.392-3;  the practice of coercing juries continued for several decades afterwards.</ref> Further,  the jury would probably have been aware that the Crown  had the right to punish jurors for acquitting an accused person  in the  face of strong evidence of their  guilt, as would happen to a [[County Kildare]]  jury in 1586.<ref>Crawford p.480</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nA story quickly circulated that Robert Dillon, at the hanging, remarked:  \"Friend Nugent, I am even with you now for coming between me and my place (i.e  the office of Chief Justice)\". Elrington Ball doubts the truth of the story, but as he remarks the fact that it was  told at all is a comment on the unease which the case aroused.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref> A few years later the then Lord Deputy of Ireland  recommended that only English judges be appointed in Ireland, as Irish born judges decided cases purely on family or local loyalties.<ref>Ball, p.150</ref> [[Roger Wilbraham]], who became [[Solicitor General for Ireland]] soon after the trial,  thought that Robert Dillon's conduct in particular had been disgraceful, but argued pragmatically that those like Dillon who did the Queen good service should not be \"pressed hard\" for anything less than a [[capital offence]].\n\n== Assessment ==\nElrington Ball states that Nugent's fate was unique: two men who had served as judges in Ireland, [[Miles Corbet]] and [[John Cook (regicide)|John Cook]], were executed in [[London]] at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] for treason against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], but in no other case  than Nugent's did the Government in Ireland execute one of its own judges.<ref>Ball, p.147</ref>\n\nWhether Nugent was guilty of treason, or even of the lesser crime of [[misprison of treason|misprision of treason]], is difficult to say. The verdict aroused  a good deal of  popular unease, due to the dubious quality of the evidence and the apparent bias of the judges. The Crown had rewarded Nugent generously, and it is difficult to see what he had to gain by rebellion.  However he and his nephew were close, and it is possible that he knew of William's plans: even if he disapproved of them, this would arguably make him guilty of  misprision of treason.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nugent, Nicholas}}\n[[Category:1582 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:People from County Meath]]\n[[Category:People executed for treason]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Irish Common Pleas]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Anglo-Irish judge}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Nicholas Nugent''' (c. 1525\u20131582) was an Anglo-Irish judge, who was hanged for [[treason]] by the government that appointed him.

Her career began in 1980 when she won the singing competition ''Search for a Star''. After appearances in various television shows and releasing her first singles, Stansfield, Ian Devaney and Andy Morris formed [[Blue Zone (band)|Blue Zone]] in 1986. The band released several singles and one album, but after the success of [[Coldcut]]'s \"[[People Hold On]]\" in 1989, on which Stansfield was featured, the focus was placed on her solo career.\n\nStansfield's first solo album ''[[Affection (Lisa Stansfield album)|Affection]]'' (1989) and its worldwide chart-topping lead single \"[[All Around the World (Lisa Stansfield song)|All Around the World]]\" were major breakthroughs in her career. She was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, and ''Affection'' is her best-selling album to date. In the following years, Stansfield released ''[[Real Love (Lisa Stansfield album)|Real Love]]'' (1991), ''[[So Natural (Lisa Stansfield album)|So Natural]]'' (1993), and ''[[Lisa Stansfield (album)|Lisa Stansfield]]'' (1997). In 1999 she appeared in her first film, ''Swing'', and also recorded the [[Swing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for it. Her next albums included ''[[Face Up (album)|Face Up]]'' (2001), ''[[Biography: The Greatest Hits]]'' (2003), and ''[[The Moment (Lisa Stansfield album)|The Moment]]'' (2004). Thereafter, Stansfield took a break from music and focused on her film career. In 2008, she starred in ''[[The Edge of Love]]'' and in 2014 she appeared in ''[[Northern Soul (film)|Northern Soul]]''.\n\nStansfield released her seventh album ''[[Seven (Lisa Stansfield album)|Seven]]'' on 31 January 2014. Its lead single \"[[Can't Dance (Lisa Stansfield song)|Can't Dance]]\" was digitally released on 16 October 2013. She promoted the album with the European [[Seven Tour]] in 2013 and 2014. Her most recent album ''[[Deeper (Lisa Stansfield album)|Deeper]]'' was released on 6 April 2018. In June 2018, following a string of sold-out tour dates in Europe, Stansfield announced her North American Tour, which began in October 2018.\n\nStansfield has won numerous awards, including [[Brit Awards]], [[Ivor Novello Awards]], [[Billboard Music Award]], [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]], [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP Award]], [[Women's World Award]], [[Silver Clef Award]]s and DMC Awards.

In 1982, she appeared on the television show ''Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment'' on [[ITV Granada]]. At the same time, Stansfield signed a recording contract with [[Polydor Records]].\n\nIn 1983, [[Johnnie Hamp]] produced for ITV Granada a documentary directed by [[Pete Walker (director)|Pete Walker]], ''Born in the Sixties: Lisa Stansfield''. It was a profile of the aspiring singer, and it included her comments and those of her mother and sisters, and some songs sung by Stansfield. Also in 1983, she co-hosted the children's television music programme ''[[Razzamatazz]]'' and appeared on another children's television series ''[[The Krankies Klub]]''. Between 1982 and 1983, Stansfield released her next three singles: \"[[The Only Way (song)|The Only Way]],\" \"[[Listen to Your Heart (Lisa Stansfield song)|Listen to Your Heart]],\" and \"[[I Got a Feeling]].\" Her early recordings were collected and released on the album ''[[In Session (Lisa Stansfield album)|In Session]]'' in September 1996.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===1984\u20131988: Blue Zone===\nIn 1984, Stansfield and former schoolmates Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, after having worked together on a school musical production, began to collaborate musically and, in 1986, formed the band [[Blue Zone (band)|Blue Zone]].<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> They wrote some songs, produced a demo, and took it around to record labels. The small indie label Rockin' Horse Records signed them in 1985, and one year later the label was bought up by [[Arista Records]]. After releasing their first two singles in 1986, \"[[Love Will Wait]]\" and \"[[Finest Thing]]\", Arista issued \"[[On Fire (Blue Zone song)|On Fire]]\" in October 1987. Just as the single was climbing the charts (number ninety-nine in the United Kingdom), it was withdrawn by the record company in the wake of the [[King's Cross fire]]. The band's next single, \"[[Thinking About His Baby]],\" was released in January 1988 and reached number seventy-nine in the UK. Its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], \"[[Big Thing (song)|Big Thing]],\" became popular on the radio and in the clubs.\n\nIn July 1988, \"[[Jackie (Elisa Fiorillo song)#Blue Zone version|Jackie]]\" was issued as a single outside the UK, reaching number thirty-seven on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and number fifty-four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States. The release date for Blue Zone's album ''[[Big Thing (Blue Zone album)|Big Thing]]'', which was recorded in 1987, was pushed back many times by the record label. Finally, it was released outside the UK in November 1988 without any further promotion. The album included songs written by Blue Zone, except for \"Jackie,\" which was written by [[Billy Steinberg]] and [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]]. The album was produced by [[Paul Staveley O'Duffy]], except for the track \"Perfect Crime,\" which was produced by Blue Zone. [[Ric Wake]] also co-produced \"Jackie\" and \"Perfect Crime.\"\n\n===1989\u20131990: ''Affection''===\nIn early 1989, Stansfield co-wrote and recorded \"[[People Hold On]]\" for [[Coldcut]]'s album ''[[What's That Noise?]]'' The single was released in March 1989, and reached number six on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] in the United States and number eleven in the United Kingdom. On the strength of this hit, [[Arista Records]] signed Stansfield to a solo deal. Her debut album ''[[Affection (Lisa Stansfield album)|Affection]]'' was released on 20 November 1989. Stansfield co-wrote all songs with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris. Devaney and Morris also produced the album, except for \"[[This Is the Right Time]],\" which was produced by Coldcut. ''Affection'' received critical acclaim from music critics, and was commercially successful. It reached the top ten on charts around the world, including number one in Austria and Italy, number two in the UK, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, number three in Belgium, number five in New Zealand, number six in the Netherlands and Norway, and number seven in Australia and Canada. In the US, it peaked at number five on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], and number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

In the US, \"All Around the World\" peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], and reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The single was certified Platinum in the US for selling over one million copies, and Gold in many other countries, including the UK, Germany, Australia, Sweden and Austria. In the UK, other singles from the album reached numbers ten (\"[[Live Together]]\"), thirteen (\"This Is the Right Time\") and twenty-five (\"[[What Did I Do to You?]]\") on the chart. In the US, \"[[You Can't Deny It]]\" peaked at number one on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, number two on Hot Dance Club Songs, and number fourteen on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"This Is the Right Time\" reached number one on Hot Dance Club Songs, number thirteen on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number twenty-one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nStansfield also toured Europe and North America in 1990 in support of the album, and eventually released the ''Live! All Around the World'' home video. Thanks to ''Affection'' and \"All Around the World,\" she received many awards, including the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], the [[Billboard Music Award]], the [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]], the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP Award]], [[Ivor Novello Awards]], [[Silver Clef Award]]s and DMC Awards. Stansfield was also nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] categories.

The song was released as a single in Europe in December 1992, after \"[[I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston version)|I Will Always Love You]]\" by [[Whitney Houston]], and reached top ten in the UK. She also wrote a song for [[Dionne Warwick]], \"Friends Can Be Lovers,\" which was produced by Ian and Andy along with another song written by Diane Warren, \"Much Too Much.\"  Lisa sang background vocals on both tracks, which appear on the 1993 Dionne Warwick album ''[[Friends Can Be Lovers]]''.\n\n===1993\u20131996: ''So Natural''===\nIn April 1993, [[George Michael]] released his charity [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Five Live (George Michael and Queen EP)|Five Live]]''.

''Five Live'' was a success, reaching number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks. During the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, which was also released on [[VHS]], Stansfield performed \"[[I Want to Break Free]],\" as well.

Stansfield toured South America, The US, and Europe in 1997 and 1998 to promote the album.\n\nIn July 1999, Stansfield's duet with [[Barry White]] \"[[The Longer We Make Love]]\" was released as a single from his album ''[[Staying Power (album)|Staying Power]]''.\n\nIn late 2000 she recorded two cover songs: \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" for the ''Motown Mania'' album (released in December 2000), and \"Somewhere My Baby Waits for Me\" for ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' soundtrack (released in January 2001).\n\n===2001\u20132003: ''Face Up'' and ''Biography: The Greatest Hits'' ===\nStansfield released her fifth studio album ''[[Face Up (album)|Face Up]]'' on 20 June 2001.

It wasn't released in North America. Stansfield toured Europe in 2001 and 2002.\n\nOn 3 February 2003, Stansfield released her first greatest-hits album, ''[[Biography: The Greatest Hits]]''. It reached number three in the United Kingdom (where it was certified Gold), number four in Italy, and also charted in other European countries. It was simultaneously issued on [[DVD]].

''[[The Complete Collection (Lisa Stansfield album)|The Complete Collection]]'', a six-[[compact disc|CD]] [[box set]], was issued simultaneously. In November 2003, she appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Mona Lisa Smile]]'', singing \"[[I've Got the World on a String]].\"\n\n===2004\u20132012: ''The Moment''===\nIn 2004, Stansfield recorded \"[[Too Hot (Kool & the Gang song)|Too Hot]]\" for [[Kool & the Gang]]'s ''The Hits: Reloaded'' (released in April 2004), and \"Breath In, Breath Out\" (duet with [[L\u00e2\u00e2m]]) for her album titled simply ''L\u00e2\u00e2m'' (released in September 2004). After fulfilling her obligation to [[Arista Records]], Stansfield signed with [[ZTT Records]]. The [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Trevor Horn]] produced her next [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented album, ''[[The Moment (Lisa Stansfield album)|The Moment]]'', which was released in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2004. It was well received by music critics, but failed commercially in the UK peaking at number fifty-seven. In February 2005, ''The Moment'' was issued in the rest of Europe by [[Edel AG|Edel]], achieving moderate success on the charts in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, reaching numbers fifteen, sixteen and twenty-two, respectively. It was also certified Gold in Germany. The album was promoted mainly by two singles: \"[[Treat Me Like a Woman]]\" and \"[[If I Hadn't Got You]].\"  She also toured Europe in June and July 2005.\n\n===2013\u20132016: ''Seven''===\nBetween May and July 2013, Stansfield toured Europe singing her greatest hits.

The small indie label Rockin' Horse Records signed them in 1985, and one year later the label was bought up by [[Arista Records]]. After releasing their first two singles in 1986, \"[[Love Will Wait]]\" and \"[[Finest Thing]]\", Arista issued \"[[On Fire (Blue Zone song)|On Fire]]\" in October 1987. Just as the single was climbing the charts (number ninety-nine in the United Kingdom), it was withdrawn by the record company in the wake of the [[King's Cross fire]]. The band's next single, \"[[Thinking About His Baby]],\" was released in January 1988 and reached number seventy-nine in the UK.

Finally, it was released outside the UK in November 1988 without any further promotion. The album included songs written by Blue Zone, except for \"Jackie,\" which was written by [[Billy Steinberg]] and [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]]. The album was produced by [[Paul Staveley O'Duffy]], except for the track \"Perfect Crime,\" which was produced by Blue Zone.

Stansfield co-wrote all songs with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris. Devaney and Morris also produced the album, except for \"[[This Is the Right Time]],\" which was produced by Coldcut.

The single was issued in May 1993, and reached number eight in the UK and Ireland. It was later included on Stansfield's third studio album, ''[[So Natural (Lisa Stansfield album)|So Natural]]'', released on 8 November 1993.\n\n''So Natural'' garnered positive reviews from music critics, and performed moderately on the charts, reaching number six in the UK and receiving Platinum certification. It also peaked within the top forty in Italy, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands. The album was promoted by two singles, \"[[So Natural (song)|So Natural]]\" and \"[[Little Bit of Heaven]],\" which reached numbers fifteen and thirty-two in the UK. ''So Natural'' was not released in North America. In 1994, Stansfield toured Japan and the UK. In late 1994 she released two singles in the United States: \"[[Make It Right (Lisa Stansfield song)|Make It Right]]\" from the ''[[Beverly Hills 90210 (soundtrack)#Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years|Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years]]'' soundtrack, and \"[[Dream Away (Babyface and Lisa Stansfield song)|Dream Away]]\" (duet with [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]]) from the film ''[[The Pagemaster]]''. Stansfield also recorded the following cover songs: \"Friday's Child\" for ''[[No Prima Donna: The Songs of Van Morrison]]'' (1994), \"[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]\" for ''[[The Glory of Gershwin]]'' (1994), \"[[Just to Keep You Satisfied]]\" for ''[[Inner City Blues: The Music of Marvin Gaye]]'' (1995), and \"Take Me Away\" (duet with [[Aska (singer)|Aska]]) for ''[[Chage and Aska|One Voice: The Songs of Chage & Aska]]'' (1996).\n\n===1997\u20132000: ''Lisa Stansfield''===\nHer self-titled fourth studio album ''[[Lisa Stansfield (album)|Lisa Stansfield]]'' was released on 21 March 1997. It garnered favourable reviews from music critics, and was commercially successful, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, number six in Belgium, and peaked inside the top forty in many European countries and Japan. It also received Gold certification in the UK, Spain, and Switzerland. In the United States the album peaked at number thirty on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], and fifty-five on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Singles released in Europe included [[People Hold On#\"People Hold On\" (The Bootleg Mixes)|\"People Hold On (The Bootleg Mixes)]],\" \"[[The Real Thing (Lisa Stansfield song)|The Real Thing]],\" \"[[Never, Never Gonna Give Ya Up#Lisa Stansfield version|Never, Never Gonna Give You Up]],\" and \"[[The Line (Lisa Stansfield song)|The Line]].\" They all entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] reaching numbers four, nine, twenty-five and sixty-four, respectively.\n\nIn the US, \"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up\" peaked at number seventy-four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and at number one on the Billboard Top Dance Tracks. The album also spawned four number-one singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Dance Club Songs]]: \"People Hold On (The Bootleg Mixes),\" \"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up,\" \"[[Never Gonna Fall]],\" and \"[[I'm Leavin' (Lisa Stansfield song)|I'm Leavin']].\" This success prompted [[Arista Records]] to release ''[[The Remix Album (Lisa Stansfield album)|The Remix Album]]'' in June 1998. Stansfield toured South America, The US, and Europe in 1997 and 1998 to promote the album.\n\nIn July 1999, Stansfield's duet with [[Barry White]] \"[[The Longer We Make Love]]\" was released as a single from his album ''[[Staying Power (album)|Staying Power]]''.\n\nIn late 2000 she recorded two cover songs: \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" for the ''Motown Mania'' album (released in December 2000), and \"Somewhere My Baby Waits for Me\" for ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' soundtrack (released in January 2001).\n\n===2001\u20132003: ''Face Up'' and ''Biography: The Greatest Hits'' ===\nStansfield released her fifth studio album ''[[Face Up (album)|Face Up]]'' on 20 June 2001. It featured [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] songs, and also the adventurous usage of [[2-step garage]] beats on the lead single \"[[Let's Just Call It Love]].\" However, ''Face Up'' performed somewhat unsuccessfully on the charts, reaching top forty in only few countries, including Switzerland, Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. It wasn't released in North America. Stansfield toured Europe in 2001 and 2002.\n\nOn 3 February 2003, Stansfield released her first greatest-hits album, ''[[Biography: The Greatest Hits]]''. It reached number three in the United Kingdom (where it was certified Gold), number four in Italy, and also charted in other European countries. It was simultaneously issued on [[DVD]]. Stansfield toured Europe in March and April 2003 to promote the compilation. In June 2003, [[Arista Records]] remastered all of her studio albums and re-released them separately with bonus tracks. ''[[The Complete Collection (Lisa Stansfield album)|The Complete Collection]]'', a six-[[compact disc|CD]] [[box set]], was issued simultaneously. In November 2003, she appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Mona Lisa Smile]]'', singing \"[[I've Got the World on a String]].\"\n\n===2004\u20132012: ''The Moment''===\nIn 2004, Stansfield recorded \"[[Too Hot (Kool & the Gang song)|Too Hot]]\" for [[Kool & the Gang]]'s ''The Hits: Reloaded'' (released in April 2004), and \"Breath In, Breath Out\" (duet with [[L\u00e2\u00e2m]]) for her album titled simply ''L\u00e2\u00e2m'' (released in September 2004). After fulfilling her obligation to [[Arista Records]], Stansfield signed with [[ZTT Records]]. The [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Trevor Horn]] produced her next [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented album, ''[[The Moment (Lisa Stansfield album)|The Moment]]'', which was released in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2004. It was well received by music critics, but failed commercially in the UK peaking at number fifty-seven. In February 2005, ''The Moment'' was issued in the rest of Europe by [[Edel AG|Edel]], achieving moderate success on the charts in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, reaching numbers fifteen, sixteen and twenty-two, respectively. It was also certified Gold in Germany. The album was promoted mainly by two singles: \"[[Treat Me Like a Woman]]\" and \"[[If I Hadn't Got You]].\"  She also toured Europe in June and July 2005.\n\n===2013\u20132016: ''Seven''===\nBetween May and July 2013, Stansfield toured Europe singing her greatest hits.

The remaining 21,000 prisoners in Buchenwald were liberated by the U.S. Third Army on April 11, 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weimar-lese.de/index.php?article_id=427|title=Die Todesmarsch-Stele in Weimar - Weimar-Lese|first=Weimar|last=Lese|date=|website=weimar-lese.de|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Stutthof to Lauenburg===\nThe evacuation of the about 50,000 prisoners from the [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]] camp system in northern Poland began in January 1945. About 5,000 prisoners from Stutthof subcamps were marched to the Baltic Sea coast, forced into the water, and machine gunned. The rest of the prisoners were marched in the direction of [[Lauenburg]] in eastern Germany. They were cut off by the advancing Soviet forces. The Germans forced the surviving prisoners back to Stutthof. Marching in severe winter conditions and treated brutally by SS guards, thousands died during the march.<ref name=ushmm-Stutthof/>\n\nIn late April 1945, the remaining prisoners were removed from Stutthof by sea, since it was completely encircled by Soviet forces. Again, hundreds of prisoners were forced into the sea and shot. Over 4,000 were sent by small boat to Germany, some to the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] near Hamburg, and some to camps along the Baltic coast. Many drowned along the way. Shortly before the German surrender, some prisoners were transferred to [[Malm\u00f6, Sweden]], and released to the care of that neutral country. It has been estimated that over 25,000 prisoners, around half, died during the evacuation from Stutthof and its subcamps. One hundred prisoners were liberated from Stutthof on May 9, 1945.<ref name=ushmm-Stutthof/>\n\n===Dachau to the Austrian border===\n[[File:Todesmarsch Krailling.jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Krailling]] for the death march from Dachau]]\nOn April 24, 1945, the satellite labor camps around [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] were being cleared out by the Nazis ahead of the advancing Allied troops, and some 15,000 prisoners were first marched to the Dachau camp, only to be sent southwards on a death march towards the Austrian border,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003130634/http://www.gz-tm-dachau.de/img/uebersicht_big.jpg|author=|date=|website=www.gz-tm-dachau.de|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> the path for which generally headed southwards, partly along the eastern shore of the [[Lake Starnberg|''Starnberger See'']], taking a left turn to the east in the town of [[Eurasburg]] and heading towards the ''[[Tegernsee (lake)|Tegernsee]]''.\n\nBy the second of May 1945, only some of the 6,000 prisoners sent on the death march were still alive; those in failing health had been shot as they fell. On that day, as the eastwards-marching prisoners had passed through [[Bad T\u00f6lz]] and were nearing [[Waakirchen]], nearly {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} south of Dachau, several hundred of the dead and dying were lying on open ground, nearly all covered in freshly fallen snow.
