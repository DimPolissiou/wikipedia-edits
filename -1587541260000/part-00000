However, the Flash Wolves ultimately lost their series 1\u20133 to [[Counter Logic Gaming]], placing 3rd\u20134th.\n\nThe Flash Wolves finished 2nd in the 2016 LMS Summer Split regular season, but were able to win their 2nd LMS title after defeating ahq in a close five-game series and [[J Team]] in a convincing 3\u20130 sweep. Qualifying for the 2016 World Championship as the #1 seed from the LMS, the Flash Wolves were drawn into Group B against South Korea's [[SK Telecom T1]], China's IMay and North America's [[Cloud9]]. They finished last in their group with a record of 2 wins to 4 losses.\n\n==== 2019 ====\nThe Flash Wolves announced on December 13, 2019 that it was disbanding its ''League of Legends'' team and would not participate in the upcoming Pacific Championship Series (PCS), the successor to the LMS.<ref name=\"Newell\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\"/>\n\n=== Final roster ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! {{abbr|Nat.|Nationality}}\n!

It was written by [[Mar\u00eda Manzano]], and published in 1996 by the [[Cambridge University Press]] as volume 19 of their book series Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science.\n\n==Topics==\nThe book concerns forms of logic that go beyond [[first-order logic]], and in particular (following the work of [[Leon Henkin]]) the project of unifying them by translating all of these extensions into a specific form of logic, [[many-sorted logic]].{{r|venema}} Beyond many-sorted logic, its topics include [[second-order logic]] (including its incompleteness and relation with [[Peano arithmetic]]), [[second-order arithmetic]], [[type theory]] (in relational, functional, and equational forms), [[modal logic]], and [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].{{r|amer|venema}}\n\nIt is organized into seven chapters. The first concerns second-order logic in its standard form, and it proves several foundational results for this logic. The second chapter introduces the [[sequent calculus]], a method of making sound deductions in second-order logic, and its incompleteness.{{r|boricic|ohlbach}} The third continues the topic of second-order logic, showing how to formulate Peano arithmetic in it, and using [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem]] to provide a second proof of incompleteness of second-order logic.{{r|venema|ohlbach}} Chapter four formulates a non-standard semantics for second-order logic (from Henkin),{{r|boricic}} in which quantification over relations is limited to only the definable relations.{{r|ohlbach}} It defines this semantics in terms of \"second-order frames\" and \"general structures\", constructions that will be used to formulate second-order concepts within many-sorted logic.{{r|venema|boricic}} In the fifth chapter, the same concepts are used to give a non-standard semantics to type theory. After these chapters on other types of logic, the final two chapters introduce many-sorted logic, prove its soundness, completeness, and [[compactness theorem|compactness]], and describe how to translate the other forms of logic into it.{{r|boricic}}\n\n==Audience and reception==\nAlthough the book is intended as a textbook for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students,{{r|venema}} reviewer Mohamed Amer suggests that it does not have enough exercises to support a course in its subject, and that some of its proofs are lacking in detail.{{r|amer}} Reviewer Hans J\u00fcrgen Ohlbach suggests that it would be more usable as a reference than a textbook, and states that \"it is certainly not suitable for undergraduates\".{{r|ohlbach}}\n\nReviewer Yde Venema wonders how much of the logical power and useful properties of the various systems treated in this book have been lost in the translation to many-sorted logic, worries about the jump in computational complexity of automated theorem proving caused by the translation, complains about the book's clarity of exposition becoming lost in case analysis, and was disappointed at the lack of coverage of [[Montague grammar]], [[fixed-point logic]], and [[non-monotonic logic]].
