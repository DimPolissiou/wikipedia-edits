In an interview, bassist Anthony Wick said this on the issue:\n\"Most of us are Christians. I think the label 'Christian Band' is more related to marketing and sales than it does an actual belief in something. You see so much of this 'We're a Christian band, this and that' sort of thing, and you just don't know what people are like outside of that setting. You can be Christian as you want to be on stage, but off-stage, it's a whole different ball game with people. I think before you say anything like that, I think you need to live your life according to what you believe, or you're just a hypocrite and it doesn't matter what you say on stage. I wouldn't label us a Christian band, but we're guys that believe in Jesus, and that's our beliefs \u2014 but we like to talk about it in a different sense, different from the idea of 'Evangelical Christian Metalcore'.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn March 2013, vocalist Garret Rapp was interviewed in which he mentions the following: \n\"I think I was in 2011 during ''Scream It Like You Mean It'' Tour. I think in the last year in my life I've really taken a step back. I can feel it when I talk...I'm in a grey area right now, I'm unsure of where I am and where I'm going, it's feel like I'm walking with quicksand beneath me half the time, it's a very unstable time of life right now. I'm just trying to do the best thing I can with what I've got given to me or I've came to do what I've tried to earn I guess...I'm just trying to do something positive for someone else, and that re-affirms a purpose in me for something right now.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3074451|title=The Color Morale - 03.08.13|work=AbsolutePunk.net|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n'''Current members'''\n* Garret Rapp \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards {{small|(2007\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n* Steve Carey \u2013 drums {{small|(2007\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n* Devin King \u2013 lead guitar {{small|(2012\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n* Aaron Saunders \u2013 rhythm guitar {{small|(2012\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}; vocals {{small|(2013\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}; backing vocals {{small|(2012\u20132013)}}\n* Mike Honson \u2013 bass, backing vocals {{small|(2013\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* John Bross \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals {{small|(2007\u20132011)}}\n* Ramon Mendoza \u2013 lead guitar {{small|(2007\u20132012)}}\n* Ryan Pulice \u2013 bass {{small|(2011\u20132012)}}\n* Justin Hieser \u2013 bass {{small|(2007\u20132011, 2012\u20132013)}}; vocals {{small|(2007\u20132013)}}; rhythm guitar {{small|(2011\u20132012)}}\n\n'''Touring musicians'''\n* Anthony Wick \u2013 bass {{small|(2011)}}\n* Ricky Thomas \u2013 bass {{small|(2013)}}\n\n'''Timeline'''\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:80 top:10 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:20/11/2007 till:{{#time:d/m/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2008\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2008\n\nColors =\n  id:LVocals     value:red          legend:Lead_vocals\n  id:BVocals     value:pink         legend:Backing_vocals\n  id:LGuitar     value:teal         legend:Lead_guitar\n  id:RGuitar     value:green        legend:Rhythm_guitar\n  id:Bass        value:blue         legend:Bass\n  id:Drums       value:orange       legend:Drums\n  id:Keys        value:purple       legend:Keyboards\n  id:studio      value:black        legend:Studio_albums\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n  at:01/09/2009\n  at:08/03/2011\n  at:25/03/2013\n  at:02/09/2014\n  at:19/08/2016\n\nBarData =\n  bar:Garret     text:\"Garret Rapp\"\n  bar:Ramon      text:\"Ramon Mendoza\"\n  bar:Devin      text:\"Devin King\"\n  bar:John       text:\"John Bross\"\n  bar:Aaron      text:\"Aaron Saunders\"\n  bar:Justin     text:\"Justin Hieser\"\n  bar:Ryan       text:\"Ryan Pulice\"\n  bar:Mike       text:\"Mike Honson\"\n  bar:Steve      text:\"Steve Carey\"\n\nPlotData=\n\n  width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4)\n  bar:Garret      from:20/11/2007  till:19/01/2018    color:LVocals\n  bar:Garret      from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:LVocals\n  bar:Garret      from:20/11/2007  till:19/01/2018    color:Keys    width:3\n  bar:Garret      from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Keys    width:3\n  bar:Ramon       from:20/11/2007  till:22/08/2012    color:LGuitar\n  bar:Devin       from:22/08/2012  till:19/01/2018    color:LGuitar\n  bar:Devin       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:LGuitar\n  bar:John        from:20/11/2007  till:20/03/2011    color:RGuitar\n  bar:John        from:20/11/2007  till:20/03/2011    color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Aaron       from:22/08/2012  till:19/01/2018    color:RGuitar\n  bar:Aaron       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:RGuitar\n  bar:Aaron       from:22/08/2012  till:19/05/2013    color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Aaron       from:19/05/2013  till:19/01/2018    color:LVocals width:3\n  bar:Aaron       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:LVocals width:3\n  bar:Justin      from:20/11/2007  till:20/03/2011    color:Bass \n  bar:Justin      from:20/03/2011  till:22/08/2012    color:RGuitar\n  bar:Justin      from:22/08/2012  till:19/05/2013    color:Bass  \n  bar:Justin      from:20/11/2007  till:19/05/2013    color:LVocals width:3\n  bar:Ryan        from:20/03/2011  till:22/08/2012    color:Bass\n  bar:Mike        from:27/05/2013  till:19/01/2018    color:Bass\n  bar:Mike        from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Bass\n  bar:Mike        from:27/05/2013  till:19/01/2018    color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Mike        from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Steve       from:20/11/2007  till:19/01/2018    color:Drums\n  bar:Steve       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Drums\n}}\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In an interview, bassist Anthony Wick said this on the issue:\n\"Most of us are Christians. I think the label 'Christian Band' is more related to marketing and sales than it does an actual belief in something. You see so much of this 'We're a Christian band, this and that' sort of thing, and you just don't know what people are like outside of that setting. You can be Christian as you want to be on stage, but off-stage, it's a whole different ball game with people. I think before you say anything like that, I think you need to live your life according to what you believe, or you're just a hypocrite and it doesn't matter what you say on stage. I wouldn't label us a Christian band, but we're guys that believe in Jesus, and that's our beliefs \u2014 but we like to talk about it in a different sense, different from the idea of 'Evangelical Christian Metalcore'.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn March 2013, vocalist Garret Rapp was interviewed in which he mentions the following: \n\"I think I was in 2011 during ''Scream It Like You Mean It'' Tour. I think in the last year in my life I've really taken a step back. I can feel it when I talk...I'm in a grey area right now, I'm unsure of where I am and where I'm going, it's feel like I'm walking with quicksand beneath me half the time, it's a very unstable time of life right now. I'm just trying to do the best thing I can with what I've got given to me or I've came to do what I've tried to earn I guess...I'm just trying to do something positive for someone else, and that re-affirms a purpose in me for something right now.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3074451|title=The Color Morale - 03.08.13|work=AbsolutePunk.net|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n'''Current members'''\n* Garret Rapp \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards {{small|(2007\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n* Steve Carey \u2013 drums {{small|(2007\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n* Devin King \u2013 lead guitar {{small|(2012\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n* Aaron Saunders \u2013 rhythm guitar {{small|(2012\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}; vocals {{small|(2013\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}; backing vocals {{small|(2012\u20132013)}}\n* Mike Honson \u2013 bass, backing vocals {{small|(2013\u20132018, 2020\u2013present)}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* John Bross \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals {{small|(2007\u20132011)}}\n* Ramon Mendoza \u2013 lead guitar {{small|(2007\u20132012)}}\n* Ryan Pulice \u2013 bass {{small|(2011\u20132012)}}\n* Justin Hieser \u2013 bass {{small|(2007\u20132011, 2012\u20132013)}}; vocals {{small|(2007\u20132013)}}; rhythm guitar {{small|(2011\u20132012)}}\n\n'''Touring musicians'''\n* Anthony Wick \u2013 bass {{small|(2011)}}\n* Ricky Thomas \u2013 bass {{small|(2013)}}\n\n'''Timeline'''\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:80 top:10 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:20/11/2007 till:{{#time:d/m/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2008\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2008\n\nColors =\n  id:LVocals     value:red          legend:Lead_vocals\n  id:BVocals     value:pink         legend:Backing_vocals\n  id:LGuitar     value:teal         legend:Lead_guitar\n  id:RGuitar     value:green        legend:Rhythm_guitar\n  id:Bass        value:blue         legend:Bass\n  id:Drums       value:orange       legend:Drums\n  id:Keys        value:purple       legend:Keyboards\n  id:studio      value:black        legend:Studio_albums\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n  at:01/09/2009\n  at:08/03/2011\n  at:25/03/2013\n  at:02/09/2014\n  at:19/08/2016\n\nBarData =\n  bar:Garret     text:\"Garret Rapp\"\n  bar:Ramon      text:\"Ramon Mendoza\"\n  bar:Devin      text:\"Devin King\"\n  bar:John       text:\"John Bross\"\n  bar:Aaron      text:\"Aaron Saunders\"\n  bar:Justin     text:\"Justin Hieser\"\n  bar:Ryan       text:\"Ryan Pulice\"\n  bar:Mike       text:\"Mike Honson\"\n  bar:Steve      text:\"Steve Carey\"\n\nPlotData=\n\n  width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4)\n  bar:Garret      from:20/11/2007  till:19/01/2018    color:LVocals\n  bar:Garret      from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:LVocals\n  bar:Garret      from:20/11/2007  till:19/01/2018    color:Keys    width:3\n  bar:Garret      from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Keys    width:3\n  bar:Ramon       from:20/11/2007  till:22/08/2012    color:LGuitar\n  bar:Devin       from:22/08/2012  till:19/01/2018    color:LGuitar\n  bar:Devin       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:LGuitar\n  bar:John        from:20/11/2007  till:20/03/2011    color:RGuitar\n  bar:John        from:20/11/2007  till:20/03/2011    color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Aaron       from:22/08/2012  till:19/01/2018    color:RGuitar\n  bar:Aaron       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:RGuitar\n  bar:Aaron       from:22/08/2012  till:19/05/2013    color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Aaron       from:19/05/2013  till:19/01/2018    color:LVocals width:3\n  bar:Aaron       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:LVocals width:3\n  bar:Justin      from:20/11/2007  till:20/03/2011    color:Bass \n  bar:Justin      from:20/03/2011  till:22/08/2012    color:RGuitar\n  bar:Justin      from:22/08/2012  till:19/05/2013    color:Bass  \n  bar:Justin      from:20/11/2007  till:19/05/2013    color:LVocals width:3\n  bar:Ryan        from:20/03/2011  till:22/08/2012    color:Bass\n  bar:Mike        from:27/05/2013  till:19/01/2018    color:Bass\n  bar:Mike        from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Bass\n  bar:Mike        from:27/05/2013  till:19/01/2018    color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Mike        from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Bvocals width:3\n  bar:Steve       from:20/11/2007  till:19/01/2018    color:Drums\n  bar:Steve       from:25/03/2020  till:end           color:Drums\n}}\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
