A dog of particular form, remarkable for his courage.<br>The bull-dog is low in stature, deep-chested, and strongly made about the shoulders and thighs, the muscles of both of which are extremely developed. His head is broad, his nose short, and the under jaw projects beyond the upper, which gives him a fierce and disagreeable aspect. His eyes are distant and prominent, and have a peculiar suspicious-like leer, which, with the distension of his nostrils, gives him also a contemptuous look; and from his teeth being always seen, he has the constant appearance of grinning, while he is perfectly placid. He is the most ferocious and unrelenting of the canine tribe, and may be considered courageous beyond every other creature in the world, for he will attack any animal, whatever be his magnitude.\n\nThe internal changes which determine the external characters of this dog, consist in a great development of the frontal sinuses, a development which elevates the bones of the forehead above the nose, and draws the cerebral cavity in the same direction.\n\nBut the most important quality, and that, perhaps, which causes all the others, although we cannot perceive the connexion, is the diminution of the brain. The cerebral capacity of the bull-dog is sensibly smaller than in any other race; and it is doubtless to the decrease of the encephalon that we must attribute its inferiority to all others in every thing relating to intelligence. The bull-dog is scarcely capable of any education, and is fitted for nothing but combat and ferocity.\n\nThis animal takes his name from his having been employed, in former times, in assaulting the bull, and he is used for the same purpose at the present day, in those districts where this brutal amusement is still practised.\n\nNothing can exceed the fury with which the bull-dog falls upon all other animals, and the invincible obstinacy with which he maintains his hold. In attacking the bull, he always assails him in front, and generally fastens upon his lip, tongue, or eye, where he holds and hangs on, in spite of the most desperate efforts of the other to free himself from his antagonist, which affords ample proof of the amazing strength and power of this animal.\n\nWhenever a bull-dog attacks any of the extremities of the body, it is invariably considered a mark of his degeneracy from the original purity of blood. Puppies will assail a bull, and thereby give a decided proof of their breed, when only six months old; and, if permitted, will rather suffer themselves to be destroyed than relinquish the contest.\n\nAlthough this trial is sometimes made with the whelps of a particular litter, to demonstrate the purity of their descent, and to prove that there has been no improper cross by which the future fame of their posterity may be affected, yet they are seldom entered in a regular ring until from fifteen to eighteen months old. But their ligaments cannot be considered as at their full strength until they are at least two years old. Indeed, amateurs say, that they are not at their prime until they have attained four or five years of age.\n\nThe bull-dog is admitted by naturalists to be one of the original and peculiar races of Britain, and may be ranked, in point of originality, with the shepherd\u2019s dog and Irish greyhound. In various districts of England this breed is still preserved in its native purity, by that class of people who delight in bullbaiting and fighting of dogs; both of which amusements, alike inhuman, are now happily on the decline. \u2014 ''Brown.''\u201d|sign = William Hamilton Maxwell.

As the breed went extinct long before [[DNA]] was recognized and little genetic material has survived, it is unclear how much the modern reincarnations of the breed resemble the original Old English Bulldog, and most of the recreations have purposely introduced differences in the breed compared to the original, most prominently reducing the breed's violent nature.\n\nOne contemporary recreation of the breed started in the 1970s, using a breeding program developed for cattle at The Ohio State University. The lineage has since split into two, known as the Olde English Bulldogge and the Leavitt Bulldog, the Leavitt Bulldog being a lighter, more athletic dog. These modern day versions, though possessing similar physical abilities, do not have the violent temperament of the Old English Bulldog.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of \"tone\" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.<ref>{{cite news\n| first      = Alex\n| last       = Williams\n| url        = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/fashion/29emoticon.html\n| title      = (-: Just Between You and Me ;-)\n| work       = [[The New York Times]]\n| date       = July 29, 2007\n| accessdate = March 22, 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-emoticon ===\nEmoticons began with the suggestion that combinations of punctuation could be used in typography to replace [[language]].

However, experts have since weighed whether the inclusion of the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] in the poem was deliberate and if it was meant to represent a smiling face. English professor Alan Jacobs argued \"punctuation in general was unsettled in the seventeenth century...

The first time an emoticon appeared in text was in the transcript of one of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s speeches written in 1862.

In total, four different emoticon designs were displayed, all using punctuation to create different typographical emoticon faces. The emoticon designs were similar to that which formed many years later in [[Japan]], often referred to as ''\"Kaomoji\"'', due to their complicated design.<ref name=\"emoticonPuck\" /> Despite the innovation, complex emoticons didn't develop in [[Japan]] until nearly a century later. In 1912, American author [[Ambrose Bierce]] was the first to suggest that a [[bracket]] could be used to represent a smiling face. He stated, \"an improvement in punctuation&nbsp;\u2013 the snigger point, or note of [[wikt:cachinnation|cachinnation]]: it is written thus&nbsp;\u203f and presents a smiling mouth.

Moving on from Bierce's theory that a horizontal [[bracket]]s could be used for a smiling face, Alan Gregg was the first recorded person to suggest that by combining [[punctuation mark]]s, more elaborate emotions could be demonstrated. There is an argument that this was the first real set of emoticons, despite later designs becoming the standard for emoticons. Gregg published his theory in 1936, in an ''[[The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon]]'' article. He suggested that by turning the bracket sideways, it could be used for the sides of the mouth or cheeks, with other punctuation used between the brackets to display various emotions. Gregg's theory took the step of creating more than one smiling face, with (-) for a normal smile and (--) for a laughing smile. The logic behind the design was that more teeth were showing on the wider design. Two other emoticons were proposed in the article, with (#) for a frown and (*) for a wink.<ref>The Harvard Lampoon, Vol. 112 No. 1, September 16, 1936, pp. 30-31</ref>\n\nEmoticons had already come into use in sci-fi [[fandom]] in the 1940s,<ref>Gregory Benford, \"A Scientist's Notebook: net@fandom.com\", ''The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction'', Vol. 90, No. 6 (June 1996), p. 90</ref> although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.\n\nThe September 1962 issue of [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] included an article titled \"Typewri-toons\". The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to \"Royal Portable\", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h \"raising its hand\".<ref>''MAD'' Magazine No. 73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pp. 36\u201337</ref> Two additional \"Typewri-toons\" articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.\n\n=== Creation of :-) and :-( ===\nThe word is a [[portmanteau]] word of the [[English language|English]] words \"emotion\" and \"icon\". In [[web forum]]s, [[instant messaging|instant messengers]] and [[online game]]s, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called \"emoticons\" as well. Emoticons for a [[smiley]] face <code>:-)</code> and sad face <code>:-(</code> appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in non-Latin scripts, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of [[kaomoji]].\n\nIn a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in April 1969, [[Alden Whitman]] asked writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]]: \"How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?\" Nabokov answered: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&nbsp;\u2013 some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.\"<ref>{{cite book|author = Nabokov|title = Strong Opinions|isbn = 978-0-679-72609-8|publisher  = Vintage Books|date = March 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679726098|accessdate = March 24, 2009|url-access = registration}}</ref>\n\nUp until this point, many of the designs considered to be early emoticons were created using fairly basic punctuation, using a single [[punctuation mark]] instead of a word or to express feeling, before individuals started combining two punctuations (often a [[colon]] and [[bracket]]) to create something that resembled a smiling face.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garber |first1=Megan |title=:) or :-)?

He is the first documented person to use a complex emoticon of three or more punctuation marks, with <code>:-)</code> and <code>:-(</code> with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion. Not only did Fahlman create two different emoticons, he also said with the emoticons that they could be used to express emotion. While Nabokov had suggested something similar to Fahlman, there was little analysis of the wider consideration of what Nabokov could do with the design. Fahlman on the other hand quickly theorized that his emoticons could be designed to replace language on a large scale. The two designs of [[colon]], [[hyphen]] and [[bracket]] were also adapted very quickly to portray a range of emotions, therefore creating the first true set of emoticons.<ref>{{cite news| title = :D turns 25| agency = Associated Press| date = September 20, 2007| url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html| accessdate  = September 20, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012051803/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html| archivedate = October 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe message from Fahlman was sent via the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] computer science general [[bulletin board system|board]] on September 19, 1982.

The two-character version <code>:)</code> which omits the nose is also very popular.\n\nThe most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny [[ambigrams]]), with or without a hyphen (nose).\nThere are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, <code>:(</code> equals sad and <code>:((</code> equals very sad. Weeping can be written as <code>:'(</code>. A blush can be expressed as <code>:\"></code>. Others include wink <code>;)</code>, a grin <code>:D</code>, smug <code>:-></code>, and tongue out <code>:P</code>, such as when [[blowing a raspberry]]. An often used combination is also <code><3</code> for a heart, and <code></3</code> for a broken heart. <code>:O</code> is also sometimes used to depict shock.\n\nA broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; <code>XD</code> and the addition of further \"D\" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. <code>XDDDD</code>. There are hundreds of other variations including <code>>:(</code> for anger, or <code>>:D</code> for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of <code>D:<</code>. <code>=K</code> for vampire teeth, <code>:s</code> for grimace, and <code>;P</code> can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a [[double entendre|second meaning]] in the sentence preceding it.<ref>Dresner & Herring (2010).</ref>\n\nAs computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The '[[shrug]]' emoticon, <code>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</code>, uses the glyph [[\u30c4]] from the Japanese [[katakana]] writing system.\n\nAn equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as <code>=)</code>, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an \"o\" as in <code>=O)</code>. In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://sourceforge.net/projects/denoser/| title      = Denoser strips noses from text| publisher  = Sourceforge.net| accessdate = March 14, 2013}}</ref> but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon <code>:-)</code> or <code>:^)</code>. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age, with younger people less likely to use a nose.<ref>{{cite journal| url         = http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol18/iss2/14/| title       = Do You Smile with Your Nose?

It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as <code>]</code> instead of <code>)</code>.\n\nSome variants are also more common in certain countries due to [[keyboard layout]]s. For example, the smiley <code>=)</code> may occur in [[Scandinavia]], where the keys for <code>=</code> and <code>)</code> are placed right beside each other. However, the <code>:)</code> variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the <code>=)</code> version a rarity. [[Diacritic]]al marks are sometimes used. The letters <code>\u00d6</code> and <code>\u00dc</code> can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of <code>:O</code> (meaning that one is surprised) and <code>:D</code> (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.\n\nSome emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact, can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example <code>D:</code> which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of <code>:D</code>.\n\n=== <span \"id=East Asian style\"><span id=\"Asian style\"><span id=\"Japanese style\">Japanese style (''kaomoji'')</span></span></span> ===\n[[File:It's all about the smilies (3578588882).jpg|thumb|200px|Kaomojis on a Japanese NTT Docomo mobile phone]]\n[[File:Kaomoji! (2334722446).jpg|thumb|200px|A Kaomoji painting in Japan]]\nUsers from [[Japan]] popularized a style of emoticons ([[:ja:\u9854\u6587\u5b57|\u9854\u6587\u5b57]], ''kaomoji, lit.'' \"face characters\") that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on [[ASCII Corporation#History|ASCII NET]], an early Japanese online service, in 1986.<ref name=\"aist\" /><ref name=\"whatjapanthinks2007\" /> Similar-looking emoticons were used on the [[Byte Information Exchange]] (BIX) around the same time.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg261.txt\n| title      = Jargon file, version 2.6.1, February 12, 1991\n| accessdate = March 14, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThese emoticons are usually found in a format similar to <code>(*_*)</code>. The [[asterisk]]s indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an [[underscore]], the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.\n\nDifferent emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, \"T\" can be used to express crying or sadness: <code>(T_T)</code>. <code>T_T</code> may also be used to mean \"unimpressed\".  The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. <code>^^</code>.  Looks of stress are represented by the likes of <code>(x_x)</code>, while <code>(-_-;)</code> is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced [[sweat drop]] (discussed further below).  <code>///</code> can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = KawaiiFace.net\n| url        = http://kawaiiface.net\n| accessdate = March 21, 2014\n| year       = 2014\n}}</ref> Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, \"cuter\" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. <code>(^.^)</code>. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. <code>(^^)</code>. \n\nParentheses are sometimes replaced with [[Bracket#Curly brackets|braces]] or [[Bracket#Square brackets|square brackets]], e.g. <code>{^_^}</code> or <code>[o_0]</code>. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. <code>^^</code>,<code> >.< </code>, <code>o_O</code>, <code>O.O</code>, <code>e_e</code>, or <code>e.e</code>. A quotation mark <code>\"</code>, apostrophe <code>'</code>, or semicolon <code>;</code> can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in [[manga]] and [[anime]].\n\nMicrosoft [[Input method editor|IME]] 2000 ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.  In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary.  Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.\n\nCommunication software allowing the use of [[Shift JIS]] encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as <code>(^\u30e0^)</code> or <code>(\u76ca)</code>.\n\nModern communication software generally utilizes [[Unicode]], which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in <code>(`\u0414\u00b4)</code> or <code>(\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f)</code>.\n\nFurther variations can be produced using Unicode [[combining character]]s, as in <code>\u0669(\u0361\u0e4f\u032f\u0361\u0e4f)\u06f6</code> or <code>\u1d98\u1d52\u1d25\u1d52\u1d85</code>.\n\n=== Combination of Japanese and Western styles ===\nEnglish-language [[anime]] forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.  Because of this, they are often called \"anime style\" emoticons in English{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums.  Emoticons such as <code><(&nbsp;^.^&nbsp;)></code>, <code><(^_^<)</code>, <code><(o_o<)</code>, <code><(&nbsp;-'.'-&nbsp;)></code>, <code><('.'-^)</code>, or <code>(>';..;')></code> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as \"{{not a typo|Kirbys}}\" in reference to their likeness to [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]] character [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]]. The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an [[intensifier]] for the emoticon in question, e.g. <code>^_________^</code> for very happy. The emoticon {{nowrap|<code>t(-_-t)</code>}} uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western [[The finger|\"middle-finger flick-off\"]] using a \"t\" as the arm, hand, and finger. Using a [[lateral click]] for the nose such as in <!-- Had to do the following since code tags prevent combining characters from combining.

The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as <code>-O-</code>, <code>-3-</code>, <code>-w-</code>, <code>'_'</code>, <code>;_;</code>, <code>T_T</code>, <code>:></code>, and <code>.V.</code> are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example <code>^_^'</code>, <code>!>_<!</code>, <code><@>_____<@>;;</code>, <code>;O;</code>, and <code>*u*</code>.  The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example <code>=0=</code>, <code>=3=</code>, <code>=w=</code>, <code>=A=</code>, and <code>=7=</code>. The <code>uwu</code> face (and its variations <code>UwU</code> and <code>OwO</code>),  is an emoticon of Japanese origin which denotes a cute expression or emotion felt by the user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/10/22/why-did-the-official-twitter-account-tweet-uwu|title=Why Did the Official Twitter Account Tweet \"uwu\"???|last=Thomas|first=Miles|website=Crunchyroll|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Inches|first=Giacomo|last2=Carman|first2=Mark James|last3=Crestani|first3=Fabio|date=2011|editor-last=Christiansen|editor-first=Henning|editor2-last=De Tr\u00e9|editor2-first=Guy|editor3-last=Yazici|editor3-first=Adnan|editor4-last=Zadrozny|editor4-first=Slawomir|editor5-last=Andreasen|editor5-first=Troels|editor6-last=Larsen|editor6-first=Henrik Legind|title=Investigating the Statistical Properties of User-Generated Documents|journal=Flexible Query Answering Systems|volume=7022|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|pages=198\u2013209|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24764-4_18|isbn=9783642247644|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/27362/files/crestani_LNCS_2011_2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in <code>\u00f2_\u00f3</code>, <code>\u00f3_\u00f2</code>, <code>\u00f5_o</code>, <code>\u00f9_u</code>, or <code>o_\u00d4</code>.\n\n=== 2channel style ===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[\u0ca0 \u0ca0]] -->\nUsers of the Japanese discussion board [[2channel]], in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], as in  <code>\u0ca0_\u0ca0</code> (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).  These were quickly picked up by [[4chan]] and spread to other Western sites soon after.  Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like [[Mona (ASCII art)|Mon\u0101]].\n\n=== Korean style ===\nIn [[South Korea]], emoticons use Korean [[Hangul]] letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean [[jamo]] (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos <code>\u3145</code>, <code>\u3141</code> or <code>\u3142</code> as the mouth/nose component and <code>\u3147</code>, <code>\u314e</code> or <code>\u314d</code> for the eyes. For example: <code>\u3147\u3145\u3147</code>, <code>\u3147\u3142\u3147</code>, <code>\u3147\u3141\u3147</code> and <code>-\u3145-</code>. Faces such as <code>'\u3145'</code>, <code>\"\u3145\"</code>, <code>'\u3142'</code> and <code>'\u3147'</code>, using quotation marks <code>\"</code> and apostrophes <code>'</code> are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as \u315c,\u3160 depict a crying face. Example: <code>\u315c\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160\u3160</code> and <code>\ub274\ub274</code> (same function as T in western style). Sometimes \u3161 (not an em-dash \"\u2014\" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in <code>\u315c.\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160.\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160.\u3161</code>, <code>\u315c_\u3160</code>, <code>\u3161^\u315c</code> and <code>\u315c\u3147\u3161</code>. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with \u3161 or \u2013 they depict a bad feeling. Examples: <code>-;/</code>, <code>--^</code>, <code>\u3161\u3161;;;</code>, <code>-_-;;</code> and <code>-_^</code>. However, <code>^^, ^\uc624^</code> means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: <code>~_~</code>, <code>--a</code>, <code>-6-</code>, <code>+0+</code>.\n\n=== Chinese ideographic style ===\n{{See also|Jiong}}\n\nThe character \u56e7 (U+56E7), which means \"bright\", It is also combined with posture emoticon Orz, such as \u56e7rz. The character existed in [[Oracle bone script]], but its use as emoticon was documented as early as January 20, 2005.<ref name=\"nownews-56E7\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.nownews.com/2005/01/20/327-1744028.htm\n| title       = \u5fc3\u60c5\u5f88orz\u55ce\uff1f \u7db2\u8def\u8c61\u5f62\u6587\u5b57\u5e7d\u9ed8\u4e00\u4e0b\n| publisher   = Nownews.com\n| date        = January 20, 2005\n| accessdate  = March 14, 2013\n| url-status     = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20121115031609/http://www.nownews.com/2005/01/20/327-1744028.htm\n| archivedate = November 15, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nOther ideographic variants for \u56e7 include \u5d2e (king \u56e7), \u8394 (queen \u56e7), \u5546 (\u56e7 with hat), \u56e7\u8208 (turtle), \u5363 ([[Bomberman]]).\n\nThe character \u69d1 (U+69D1), which sounds like the word for \"plum\" (\u6885 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of \u5446 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness. In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of \u69d1) might be [[Reduplication#Chinese|duplicated]] to express emphasis.\n\n== Russian smiley ==\nOn the Russian speaking internet, the right parenthesis  <code>)</code>  is used as a smiley. Multiple parentheses  <code>))))</code>  are used to express greater happiness, amusement or laughter. It is commonly placed at the end of a sentence. The colon is omitted due to being in a lesser-known and difficult to type position on the [[JCUKEN|\u0419\u0426\u0423\u041a\u0415\u041d keyboard layout]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Posture emoticons ==\n=== Orz ===\n[[File:Dogeza 2015-01-15.png|thumb|The Japanese custom of ''[[dogeza]]'']]\n[[wikt:Orz|Orz]] (other forms include: {{nowrap|Or2,}} {{nowrap|on_,}} {{nowrap|OTZ,}} {{nowrap|OTL,}} {{nowrap|STO,}} {{nowrap|JTO,}}<ref name=\"boing-orz\">{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/07/all-about-orz.html\n| author     = Boing Boing\n| title      = All about Orz\n| accessdate = March 24, 2009\n| date = February 7, 2005\n}}</ref> {{nowrap|_no,}} {{nowrap|\uff3f\u5182\u25cb,}}<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.dfnt.net/t/photo/your/craft_06suman.shtml\n| title      = \u307f\u3093\u306a\u306e\u4f5c\u3063\u305f <nowiki>\uff3f&#124;\uffe3&#124;\u25cb\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8</nowiki> \"paper craft of orz\"\n| accessdate = August 18, 2009\n}}</ref> {{nowrap|[[Jiong|\u56e7]]{{zwsp}}rz,}}<ref name=\"nownews-56E7\" />) is an emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person (the Japanese version of which is called ''[[dogeza]]'') with the \"o\" being the head, the \"r\" being the arms and part of the body, and the \"z\" being part of the body and the legs.

Moving on from Bierce's theory that a horizontal [[bracket]]s could be used for a smiling face, Alan Gregg was the first recorded person to suggest that by combining [[punctuation mark]]s, more elaborate emotions could be demonstrated. There is an argument that this was the first real set of emoticons, despite later designs becoming the standard for emoticons. Gregg published his theory in 1936, in an ''[[The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon]]'' article. He suggested that by turning the bracket sideways, it could be used for the sides of the mouth or cheeks, with other punctuation used between the brackets to display various emotions. Gregg's theory took the step of creating more than one smiling face, with (-) for a normal smile and (--) for a laughing smile. The logic behind the design was that more teeth were showing on the wider design. Two other emoticons were proposed in the article, with (#) for a frown and (*) for a wink.<ref>The Harvard Lampoon, Vol. 112 No. 1, September 16, 1936, pp. 30-31</ref>\n\nEmoticons had already come into use in sci-fi [[fandom]] in the 1940s,<ref>Gregory Benford, \"A Scientist's Notebook: net@fandom.com\", ''The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction'', Vol. 90, No. 6 (June 1996), p. 90</ref> although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.\n\nThe September 1962 issue of [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] included an article titled \"Typewri-toons\". The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to \"Royal Portable\", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h \"raising its hand\".<ref>''MAD'' Magazine No. 73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pp. 36\u201337</ref> Two additional \"Typewri-toons\" articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.\n\n=== Creation of :-) and :-( ===\nThe word is a [[portmanteau]] word of the [[English language|English]] words \"emotion\" and \"icon\". In [[web forum]]s, [[instant messaging|instant messengers]] and [[online game]]s, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called \"emoticons\" as well. Emoticons for a [[smiley]] face <code>:-)</code> and sad face <code>:-(</code> appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in non-Latin scripts, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of [[kaomoji]].\n\nIn a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in April 1969, [[Alden Whitman]] asked writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]]: \"How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?\" Nabokov answered: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&nbsp;\u2013 some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.\"<ref>{{cite book|author = Nabokov|title = Strong Opinions|isbn = 978-0-679-72609-8|publisher  = Vintage Books|date = March 1990|url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679726098|accessdate = March 24, 2009|url-access = registration}}</ref>\n\nUp until this point, many of the designs considered to be early emoticons were created using fairly basic punctuation, using a single [[punctuation mark]] instead of a word or to express feeling, before individuals started combining two punctuations (often a [[colon]] and [[bracket]]) to create something that resembled a smiling face.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Garber |first1=Megan |title=:) or :-)?

He is the first documented person to use a complex emoticon of three or more punctuation marks, with <code>:-)</code> and <code>:-(</code> with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion. Not only did Fahlman create two different emoticons, he also said with the emoticons that they could be used to express emotion. While Nabokov had suggested something similar to Fahlman, there was little analysis of the wider consideration of what Nabokov could do with the design. Fahlman on the other hand quickly theorized that his emoticons could be designed to replace language on a large scale. The two designs of [[colon]], [[hyphen]] and [[bracket]] were also adapted very quickly to portray a range of emotions, therefore creating the first true set of emoticons.<ref>{{cite news| title = :D turns 25| agency = Associated Press| date = September 20, 2007| url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html| accessdate  = September 20, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012051803/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html| archivedate = October 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe message from Fahlman was sent via the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] computer science general [[bulletin board system|board]] on September 19, 1982. The conversation was taking place between many notable computer scientists, including [[David Touretzky]], [[Guy L. Steele Jr.|Guy Steele]], and [[Jaime Carbonell]].

The two-character version <code>:)</code> which omits the nose is also very popular.\n\nThe most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny [[ambigrams]]), with or without a hyphen (nose).\nThere are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, <code>:(</code> equals sad and <code>:((</code> equals very sad. Weeping can be written as <code>:'(</code>. A blush can be expressed as <code>:\"></code>. Others include wink <code>;)</code>, a grin <code>:D</code>, smug <code>:-></code>, and tongue out <code>:P</code>, such as when [[blowing a raspberry]]. An often used combination is also <code><3</code> for a heart, and <code></3</code> for a broken heart. <code>:O</code> is also sometimes used to depict shock.\n\nA broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; <code>XD</code> and the addition of further \"D\" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. <code>XDDDD</code>. There are hundreds of other variations including <code>>:(</code> for anger, or <code>>:D</code> for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of <code>D:<</code>. <code>=K</code> for vampire teeth, <code>:s</code> for grimace, and <code>;P</code> can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a [[double entendre|second meaning]] in the sentence preceding it.<ref>Dresner & Herring (2010).</ref>\n\nAs computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The '[[shrug]]' emoticon, <code>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</code>, uses the glyph [[\u30c4]] from the Japanese [[katakana]] writing system.\n\nAn equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as <code>=)</code>, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an \"o\" as in <code>=O)</code>. In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://sourceforge.net/projects/denoser/| title      = Denoser strips noses from text| publisher  = Sourceforge.net| accessdate = March 14, 2013}}</ref> but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon <code>:-)</code> or <code>:^)</code>. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age, with younger people less likely to use a nose.<ref>{{cite journal| url         = http://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol18/iss2/14/| title       = Do You Smile with Your Nose?

It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as <code>]</code> instead of <code>)</code>.\n\nSome variants are also more common in certain countries due to [[keyboard layout]]s. For example, the smiley <code>=)</code> may occur in [[Scandinavia]], where the keys for <code>=</code> and <code>)</code> are placed right beside each other. However, the <code>:)</code> variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the <code>=)</code> version a rarity. [[Diacritic]]al marks are sometimes used. The letters <code>\u00d6</code> and <code>\u00dc</code> can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of <code>:O</code> (meaning that one is surprised) and <code>:D</code> (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.\n\nSome emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact, can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example <code>D:</code> which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of <code>:D</code>.\n\n=== <span \"id=East Asian style\"><span id=\"Asian style\"><span id=\"Japanese style\">Japanese style (''kaomoji'')</span></span></span> ===\n[[File:It's all about the smilies (3578588882).jpg|thumb|200px|Kaomojis on a Japanese NTT Docomo mobile phone]]\n[[File:Kaomoji! (2334722446).jpg|thumb|200px|A Kaomoji painting in Japan]]\nUsers from [[Japan]] popularized a style of emoticons ([[:ja:\u9854\u6587\u5b57|\u9854\u6587\u5b57]], ''kaomoji, lit.'' \"face characters\") that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on [[ASCII Corporation#History|ASCII NET]], an early Japanese online service, in 1986.<ref name=\"aist\" /><ref name=\"whatjapanthinks2007\" /> Similar-looking emoticons were used on the [[Byte Information Exchange]] (BIX) around the same time.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg261.txt\n| title      = Jargon file, version 2.6.1, February 12, 1991\n| accessdate = March 14, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThese emoticons are usually found in a format similar to <code>(*_*)</code>. The [[asterisk]]s indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an [[underscore]], the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.\n\nDifferent emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, \"T\" can be used to express crying or sadness: <code>(T_T)</code>. <code>T_T</code> may also be used to mean \"unimpressed\".  The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. <code>^^</code>.  Looks of stress are represented by the likes of <code>(x_x)</code>, while <code>(-_-;)</code> is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced [[sweat drop]] (discussed further below).  <code>///</code> can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = KawaiiFace.net\n| url        = http://kawaiiface.net\n| accessdate = March 21, 2014\n| year       = 2014\n}}</ref> Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, \"cuter\" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. <code>(^.^)</code>. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. <code>(^^)</code>. \n\nParentheses are sometimes replaced with [[Bracket#Curly brackets|braces]] or [[Bracket#Square brackets|square brackets]], e.g. <code>{^_^}</code> or <code>[o_0]</code>. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. <code>^^</code>,<code> >.< </code>, <code>o_O</code>, <code>O.O</code>, <code>e_e</code>, or <code>e.e</code>. A quotation mark <code>\"</code>, apostrophe <code>'</code>, or semicolon <code>;</code> can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in [[manga]] and [[anime]].\n\nMicrosoft [[Input method editor|IME]] 2000 ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.  In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary.  Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.\n\nCommunication software allowing the use of [[Shift JIS]] encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as <code>(^\u30e0^)</code> or <code>(\u76ca)</code>.\n\nModern communication software generally utilizes [[Unicode]], which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in <code>(`\u0414\u00b4)</code> or <code>(\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\u273f)</code>.\n\nFurther variations can be produced using Unicode [[combining character]]s, as in <code>\u0669(\u0361\u0e4f\u032f\u0361\u0e4f)\u06f6</code> or <code>\u1d98\u1d52\u1d25\u1d52\u1d85</code>.\n\n=== Combination of Japanese and Western styles ===\nEnglish-language [[anime]] forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.  Because of this, they are often called \"anime style\" emoticons in English{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums.  Emoticons such as <code><(&nbsp;^.^&nbsp;)></code>, <code><(^_^<)</code>, <code><(o_o<)</code>, <code><(&nbsp;-'.'-&nbsp;)></code>, <code><('.'-^)</code>, or <code>(>';..;')></code> which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as \"{{not a typo|Kirbys}}\" in reference to their likeness to [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]] character [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]]. The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an [[intensifier]] for the emoticon in question, e.g. <code>^_________^</code> for very happy. The emoticon {{nowrap|<code>t(-_-t)</code>}} uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western [[The finger|\"middle-finger flick-off\"]] using a \"t\" as the arm, hand, and finger. Using a [[lateral click]] for the nose such as in <!-- Had to do the following since code tags prevent combining characters from combining.

The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as <code>-O-</code>, <code>-3-</code>, <code>-w-</code>, <code>'_'</code>, <code>;_;</code>, <code>T_T</code>, <code>:></code>, and <code>.V.</code> are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example <code>^_^'</code>, <code>!>_<!</code>, <code><@>_____<@>;;</code>, <code>;O;</code>, and <code>*u*</code>.  The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example <code>=0=</code>, <code>=3=</code>, <code>=w=</code>, <code>=A=</code>, and <code>=7=</code>. The <code>uwu</code> face (and its variations <code>UwU</code> and <code>OwO</code>),  is an emoticon of Japanese origin which denotes a cute expression or emotion felt by the user.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/10/22/why-did-the-official-twitter-account-tweet-uwu|title=Why Did the Official Twitter Account Tweet \"uwu\"???|last=Thomas|first=Miles|website=Crunchyroll|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Inches|first=Giacomo|last2=Carman|first2=Mark James|last3=Crestani|first3=Fabio|date=2011|editor-last=Christiansen|editor-first=Henning|editor2-last=De Tr\u00e9|editor2-first=Guy|editor3-last=Yazici|editor3-first=Adnan|editor4-last=Zadrozny|editor4-first=Slawomir|editor5-last=Andreasen|editor5-first=Troels|editor6-last=Larsen|editor6-first=Henrik Legind|title=Investigating the Statistical Properties of User-Generated Documents|journal=Flexible Query Answering Systems|volume=7022|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|pages=198\u2013209|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24764-4_18|isbn=9783642247644|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/27362/files/crestani_LNCS_2011_2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in <code>\u00f2_\u00f3</code>, <code>\u00f3_\u00f2</code>, <code>\u00f5_o</code>, <code>\u00f9_u</code>, or <code>o_\u00d4</code>.\n\n=== 2channel style ===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[\u0ca0 \u0ca0]] -->\nUsers of the Japanese discussion board [[2channel]], in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], as in  <code>\u0ca0_\u0ca0</code> (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).  These were quickly picked up by [[4chan]] and spread to other Western sites soon after.  Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like [[Mona (ASCII art)|Mon\u0101]].\n\n=== Korean style ===\nIn [[South Korea]], emoticons use Korean [[Hangul]] letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean [[jamo]] (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos <code>\u3145</code>, <code>\u3141</code> or <code>\u3142</code> as the mouth/nose component and <code>\u3147</code>, <code>\u314e</code> or <code>\u314d</code> for the eyes. For example: <code>\u3147\u3145\u3147</code>, <code>\u3147\u3142\u3147</code>, <code>\u3147\u3141\u3147</code> and <code>-\u3145-</code>. Faces such as <code>'\u3145'</code>, <code>\"\u3145\"</code>, <code>'\u3142'</code> and <code>'\u3147'</code>, using quotation marks <code>\"</code> and apostrophes <code>'</code> are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as \u315c,\u3160 depict a crying face. Example: <code>\u315c\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160\u3160</code> and <code>\ub274\ub274</code> (same function as T in western style). Sometimes \u3161 (not an em-dash \"\u2014\" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in <code>\u315c.\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160.\u315c</code>, <code>\u3160.\u3161</code>, <code>\u315c_\u3160</code>, <code>\u3161^\u315c</code> and <code>\u315c\u3147\u3161</code>. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with \u3161 or \u2013 they depict a bad feeling. Examples: <code>-;/</code>, <code>--^</code>, <code>\u3161\u3161;;;</code>, <code>-_-;;</code> and <code>-_^</code>. However, <code>^^, ^\uc624^</code> means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age).

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable.

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice.

During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life Beyond Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebeyondearthi0000fein |url-access=registration |first=Gerald |last= Feinberg |author2=Robert Shapiro |publisher=Morrow |date=1980 |isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 }}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name=\"dsmammonia\">{{cite book |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |first=Dirk |last= Schulze-Makuch |first2=Louis Neal |last2=Irwin |publisher=Springer |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn= 9783540768166 |page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown in blue]]\nA [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (273&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C (373&nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between \u221278&nbsp;\u00b0C (195&nbsp;K) and \u221233&nbsp;\u00b0C (240&nbsp;K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name=\"dsmammonia\"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.<ref name=\"asimov\"/>\n\nAmmonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at \u221277&nbsp;\u00b0C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;\u00b0C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]].

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable.

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life Beyond Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebeyondearthi0000fein |url-access=registration |first=Gerald |last= Feinberg |author2=Robert Shapiro |publisher=Morrow |date=1980 |isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 }}</ref> Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].<ref name=\"dsmammonia\">{{cite book |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |first=Dirk |last= Schulze-Makuch |first2=Louis Neal |last2=Irwin |publisher=Springer |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn= 9783540768166 |page=119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown in blue]]\nA [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth.

Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature.

Clarke]]'s short story \"[[Technical Error]]\", there is an example of differing [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]].\n|-\n| Alternative-[[chirality]] biomolecules \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| The concept of reversed chirality also figured prominently in the plot of [[James Blish]]'s ''Star Trek'' novel ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', where a transporter experiment gone awry ends up creating a duplicate Spock who turns out to be a perfect mirror-image of the original all the way down to the atomic level.\n|-\n| Exotic matrix life \n| Nonplanetary life \n| The eponymous organism in [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' is described as reproducing via the direct conversion of energy into matter.\n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| Silicoids: [[John Drury Clark|John Clark]], in the introduction to the 1952 shared-world anthology ''[[The Petrified Planet]]'', outlined the biologies of the planet Uller, with a mixture of siloxane and silicone life, and of Niflheim, where metabolism is based on hydrofluoric acid and carbon tetrafluoride. Also, [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]'s short story ''[[The Talking Stone]]'' describes silicon-based life forms found on some asteroids in our Solar System.\n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[The Devil in the Dark]]\", a highly intelligent silicon-based creature called Horta, made almost entirely of pure rock, with eggs which take the form of silicon nodules scattered throughout the caverns and tunnels of its home planet. Subsequently, in the non-canonical Star Trek book ''[[The Romulan Way]]'', another Horta is a junior officer in Starfleet.\n|-\n| Exotic matrix life \n| Nonplanetary life \n| In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the [[Crystalline Entity]] appeared in two episodes, \"[[Datalore]]\" and \"[[Silicon Avatar]]\". This was an enormous spacefaring [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]] that had taken thousands of lives in its quest for energy. It was destroyed before communications could be established.\n|-\n| Exotic biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode \"[[Home Soil]]\", the Enterprise investigates the sabotage of a planetary terraforming station and the death of one of its members; these events are finally attributed to a completely non-organic, solar powered, saline thriving sentient life form. \n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[Observer Effect (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Observer Effect]]\", Ensign Sato and Commander Tucker are infected by a silicon-based virus, while being observed by a non-physical life forms called [[List of Star Trek races#Organian|Organians]] testing humanity if they are intelligent enough to engage in first contact. A reference to the film ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|The Andromeda Strain]]'' was also made in this episode.\n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In the 1994 ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode \"[[Firewalker (The X-Files)|Firewalker]]\", Mulder and Scully investigate a death in a remote research base and discover that a new silicon-based fungus found in the area may be affecting and killing the researchers.\n|-\n| Exotic biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| The [[Orion's Arm Universe Project]], an online collaborative science-fiction project, includes a number of extraterrestrial species with exotic biochemistries, including organisms based on low-temperature [[carbohydrate]] chemistry, organisms that consume and live within [[sulfuric acid]], and organisms composed of structured [[magnetic flux tubes]] within [[neutron star]]s or [[gas giant]] cores.\n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In [[Muv-Luv Alternative]], BETA aliens, while being [[Carbon-based life|carbon-based life forms]], were made by [[silicone]]-based extra terrestrial creators, whom do not see carbon-based life forms capable of achieving intelligence.\n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In [[JoJolion|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion]], a race of intelligent silicon-based life forms known as the Rock Humans serve as the collective antagonists of the part.\n|-\n| Sulfur biochemistry \n| Alternate biochemistry \n| In the Stargate SG-1 episode \"Scorched Earth\" a robotic terraforming ship is converting an already occupied planet so that a sulfur-based lifeform, the Gadmeer, may be reconstituted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gateworld.net/sg1/s4/scorched-earth/|title=Scorched Earth \u00bb GateWorld}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Abiogenesis]]\n* [[Astrobiology]]\n* [[Carbon chauvinism]]\n* [[Carbon-based life]]\n* [[Earliest known life forms]]\n* [[Extraterrestrial life]]\n* [[Hachimoji DNA]]\n* [[Iron\u2013sulfur world hypothesis]]\n* [[Nexus for Exoplanet System Science]]\n* [[Non-cellular life]]\n* [[Non-proteinogenic amino acids]]\n* [[Nucleic acid analogues]]\n* [[Planetary habitability]]\n* [[Shadow biosphere]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal| journal=Astrobiology |title=Many Chemistries Could Be Used to Build Living Systems | date=2004 |volume=4 |pages= 137\u2013167 | author=W.
