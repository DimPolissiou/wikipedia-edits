He is a thorough master of every branch of learning. He is fond of war and music, and incapable of being repulsed by any science or any course of action.<ref>The Mahabharata of Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa Volume 1 Books 1, 2 and 3, Section XII</ref>\n\n==Puranas==\n[[File:Narada found Vishnu as macroform.jpg|thumb|Narada found Vishnu in his [[Vishvarupa|vishwa swarupa]] form]]\n[[File:Sage Sanathkumar teaching Narada muni.jpg|left|thumb|Sage Sanathkumar teaches Brahma vidya to Narada]]\nThe [[Bhagavata Purana]] describes the story of Narada's spiritual enlightenment: He was the primary source of information among Gods, and is believed to be the first journalist on Earth. In his previous birth Narada was a [[Gandharva]] (angelic being) who had been cursed to be born on an earthly planet for singing glories to the demigods instead of the Supreme Lord.<ref>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.15.72</ref> He was born as the son of a maid-servant of some particularly [[saint]]ly priests. The priests, being pleased with both his and his mother's service, blessed him by allowing him to eat some of their food ([[prasad]]), previously offered to their lord, Vishnu.\n\nGradually he received further blessings from these sages and heard them discussing many spiritual topics. After his mother died, he decided to roam the forest in search of enlightenment in understanding the 'Supreme Absolute Truth'.\n\nReaching a tranquil forest location, after quenching his thirst from a nearby stream, he sat under a tree in meditation ([[yoga]]), concentrating on the [[paramatma]] form of Vishnu within his heart as he had been taught by the priests he had served. After some time Narada experienced a vision wherein Narayana (Vishnu) appeared before him, smiling, and spoke \"that despite having the blessing of seeing him at that very moment, Narada would not be able to see his (Vishnu's) divine form again until he died\". Narayana further explained that the reason he had been given a chance to see his form was because his beauty and love would be a source of inspiration and would fuel his dormant desire to be with the lord again. After instructing Narada in this manner, Vishnu then disappeared from his sight. The boy awoke from his meditation both thrilled and disappointed.\n\nFor the rest of his life Narada focused on his devotion, meditation upon and worship to Vishnu. After his death Vishnu then blessed him with the spiritual form of \"Narada\" as he eventually became known. In many Hindu scriptures Narada is considered a saktyavesa-avatara or partial-manifestation ([[avatar]]) of God, empowered to perform miraculous tasks on Vishnu's behalf.\n\nNarada temples are few, most prominent being Sri Narada Muni Temple at [[Chigateri]], [[Karnataka]].<ref>[http://www.charanamrit.com/gods/narada_1147 Hindu Gods and Goddesses]</ref>\n\nIn the ''Padma Purana'' and some other texts, Narada is transformed into a woman for a time.<ref>Cheever Mackenzie Brown, ''The Triumph of the Goddess: The Canonical Models and Theological Visions of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana'' (1990), page 212</ref><ref>Amara Das Wilhelm, ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'' (2004), page 153</ref>\n\n==Jainism==\n{{main|salakapurusa}}\nIn Jainism, there are a total of 9 Naradas in every cycle of [[Jain Cosmology]];{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} current cycle's Naradas were [[Bhima]], Mahabhima, [[Rudra]], [[Maharudra]], [[K\u0101la (time)|Kala]], [[Mahakala]], Durmukha, Narakamukha and Adhomukha.\n\n[[File:Narada Muni.jpg|300px|thumb|Sri Narada Muni]]\n[[File:Narada Muni Temple.jpg|300px|thumb|Sri Narada Muni Temple.

The [[Narada Bhakti Sutra]] is attributed to him.\nHe would usually make his entrance vocally chanting Narayana, Narayana before optically appearing in the scene.\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nOther texts named after Narada include [[Narada Purana]] and the [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] (pre 6th century CE text), the latter called the \"juridical text par excellence\" and representing the only [[Dharma\u015b\u0101stra]] text which deals solely with juridical matters while ignoring those of righteous conduct and penance.<ref>Lariviere 1989: ix</ref>\n\nThe name Narada, referring to many different persons, appears in many mythical legends of [[Hinduism]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Devdutt Pattanaik|title=The Goddess in India: The Five Faces of the Eternal Feminine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjL3ogbdJNkC&pg=PA80 |year=2000|publisher=Inner Traditions |isbn=978-0-89281-807-5|page=80 }}</ref> as an earlier birth of [[Sariputta]] in the Jataka tales of [[Buddhism]] as well as names of medieval Buddhist scholars,<ref>{{cite book|author=Sarah Shaw|title=THE JATAKAS: Birth Stories of Bodhisatta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C&pg=PT497 |year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-81-8475-034-8 |page=497 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Ramstedt|title=Hinduism in Modern Indonesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rBhGEN0RyYC |year=2005| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-135-79052-3 |page=50 }}</ref> and in [[Jainism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC |year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-1376-2|pages=273 with footnotes}}</ref>\n\n==Mahabharata==\nIn the Mahabharata, Narada is portrayed as being conversant with the [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]] and as acquainted with history and Puranas. He has mastery of the six Angas: pronunciation, grammar, prosody, terms, religious rites and astronomy. All celestial beings worship him for his knowledge - he is supposed to be well versed in all that occurred in ancient Kalpas (time cycles) and is termed to be conversant with Nyaya (logic) and the truth of moral science. He is a perfect master in re-conciliatory texts and differentiating in applying general principles to particular cases. He can swiftly interpret contraries by references to differences in situation. He is eloquent, resolute, intelligent and a possessor of powerful memory. He knows the science of morals, politics; he is skilled in drawing inference from evidence, and very proficient in distinguishing inferior things from superior ones. He is competent in judging the correctness and incorrectness of complex syllogistic statements consisting of 5 proponents. He is capable of arriving at definite conclusions about religion, wealth, pleasure and salvation. He possesses knowledge of this whole universe and everything surrounding it. He is capable of successfully answering [[Brihaspati]] himself, while arguing. He is a master of the Sankhya and Yoga systems of philosophy, conversant with sciences of war and treaty and proficient in drawing conclusions by judging things not within direct knowledge. He knows about the six sciences of treaty, war, military campaigns, maintenance of posts against the enemy and strategies of ambushes and reserves. He is a thorough master of every branch of learning. He is fond of war and music, and incapable of being repulsed by any science or any course of action.<ref>The Mahabharata of Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa Volume 1 Books 1, 2 and 3, Section XII</ref>\n\n==Puranas==\n[[File:Narada found Vishnu as macroform.jpg|thumb|Narada found Vishnu in his [[Vishvarupa|viraat swarupa]] form]]\n[[File:Sage Sanathkumar teaching Narada muni.jpg|left|thumb|Sage Sanathkumar teaches Brahma vidya to Narada]]\nThe [[Bhagavata Purana]] describes the story of Narada's spiritual enlightenment: He was the primary source of information among Gods, and is believed to be the first journalist on Earth. In his previous birth Narada was a [[Gandharva]] (angelic being) who had been cursed to be born on an earthly planet for singing glories to the demigods instead of the Supreme Lord.<ref>Srimad Bhagavatam 7.15.72</ref> He was born as the son of a maid-servant of some particularly [[saint]]ly priests. The priests, being pleased with both his and his mother's service, blessed him by allowing him to eat some of their food ([[prasad]]), previously offered to their lord, Vishnu.\n\nGradually he received further blessings from these sages and heard them discussing many spiritual topics. After his mother died, he decided to roam the forest in search of enlightenment in understanding the 'Supreme Absolute Truth'.\n\nReaching a tranquil forest location, after quenching his thirst from a nearby stream, he sat under a tree in meditation ([[yoga]]), concentrating on the [[paramatma]] form of Vishnu within his heart as he had been taught by the priests he had served. After some time Narada experienced a vision wherein Narayana (Vishnu) appeared before him, smiling, and spoke \"that despite having the blessing of seeing him at that very moment, Narada would not be able to see his (Vishnu's) divine form again until he died\". Narayana further explained that the reason he had been given a chance to see his form was because his beauty and love would be a source of inspiration and would fuel his dormant desire to be with the lord again. After instructing Narada in this manner, Vishnu then disappeared from his sight. The boy awoke from his meditation both thrilled and disappointed.\n\nFor the rest of his life Narada focused on his devotion, meditation upon and worship to Vishnu. After his death Vishnu then blessed him with the spiritual form of \"Narada\" as he eventually became known. In many Hindu scriptures Narada is considered a saktyavesa-avatara or partial-manifestation ([[avatar]]) of God, empowered to perform miraculous tasks on Vishnu's behalf.\n\nNarada temples are few, most prominent being Sri Narada Muni Temple at [[Chigateri]], [[Karnataka]].<ref>[http://www.charanamrit.com/gods/narada_1147 Hindu Gods and Goddesses]</ref>\n\nIn the ''Padma Purana'' and some other myths, Narada is transformed into a woman for a time.<ref>Cheever Mackenzie Brown, ''The Triumph of the Goddess: The Canonical Models and Theological Visions of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana'' (1990), page 212</ref><ref>Amara Das Wilhelm, ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'' (2004), page 153</ref>\n\n==Jainism==\n{{main|salakapurusa}}\nIn Jainism, there are a total of 9 Naradas in every cycle of [[Jain Cosmology]];{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} current cycle's Naradas were [[Bhima]], Mahabhima, [[Rudra]], [[Maharudra]], [[K\u0101la (time)|Kala]], [[Mahakala]], Durmukha, Narakamukha and Adhomukha.\n\n[[File:Narada Muni.jpg|300px|thumb|Sri Narada Muni]]\n[[File:Narada Muni Temple.jpg|300px|thumb|Sri Narada Muni Temple.

'''Lusit. \u00c9vora'''), is a Portuguese [[sports club]] club based in [[\u00c9vora]],<ref>[http://www.zerozero.pt/local.php?id=153 \u00c9vora]; ZeroZero, 24 July 2012</ref> that competes in Serie D of [[Campeonato de Portugal (league)|Campeonato de Portugal]], third tier of Portuguese football. Founded on 11 November 1911 by a group of high school and commercial school youngsters, in the house of professor D\u00e2maso Sim\u00f5es at Rua das Fontes, No. 3 in \u00c9vora as ''Lusitano Acad\u00e9mico'', it subsequently became ''Lusitano Futebol'' and finally Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube in 1925. The club's home ground is the [[Campo Estrela]] in \u00c9vora, purchased in 1931.\n\nLusitano GC entered the [[1952\u201353 Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], finishing up 7th in their first season ever. The club spent 14 consecutive seasons in the [[Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], its major period of success in the 1950s and 1960s, earning an honorable 5th place in 1956/57, and reaching the semi-finals of the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] twice. After relegation in 1966 the club went through a period of decline, never regaining access to the Portuguese top flight ever again and even descending to regional championships. The club is still today in the top 30 of teams with the most presences in the Portuguese League.\n\nLusitano establish a SAD (''Sociedade An\u00f3nima Desportiva)'' in 2016 and won the 2018/2019 Liga Century 21-Porta do Alentejo, thus earning promotion back to national football.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Lusitano\" is derived from ''[[Lusitania]]'', the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name for the province corresponding to the current territory of Portugal south of the Douro river and to modern day Spanish region of Extremadura.\n\n===Motto===\nThe club's motto is ''Fazer Forte Fraca Gente'' (Portuguese for Making the Weak Stronger).\n\n===Foundation===\nThe club was founded November 11, 1911 (''11-11-1911'' in a sport played with 11 players). In addition, its first headquarters was in Travessa da Bola No. 11, in \u00c9vora.\n\n=== First Victories ===\nIn 1917/18 Lusitano won its first Evora FA championship. It would win many district championships afterwards (1921/22, 1922/23, 1926/27, 1927/28, 1928/29. 1930/31, 1932/33, 1933/34, 1934/35, 1939/40, 1940/41.<ref>http://arquivista-evora.blogspot.com/</ref> \n\nThe year 1925 proved decisive for the future of the club. At the initiative of historical leaders such as Jos\u00e9 Benchimol, Napole\u00e3o Palma, Alberto da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Ant\u00f3nio Prazeres, the club was restructured, the facilities were reorganized and its action extended to other modalities, with emphasis on gymnastics that would reach great projection. Lusitano started betting on a concept of full personal development, involving the man and the athlete, a design that would be the hallmark of all those who have passed through their teams over the years.<ref>https://lusitano-ginasio-clube.blogspot.com/2011/11/centenario-historia-do-lusitano-ginasio.html</ref>\n\nBetween 1929/30 and 1933/34 the Eborians competed in the [[Campeonato de Portugal (1922-1938)|Campeonato de Portugal]], without recording significant results. The club obtained its best classification in 1930/31, reaching the final quarter lost to [[S.C. Salgueiros|Salgueiros]]. \n\nIn 1931 the mythical Campo Estrela was purchased. On November 6, 1932, Lusitano beat Benfica 4-1 in Evora in a private game. Between 1934/35 and 1937/38 the club was one of the forerunners of the League Championship of the [[Portuguese Second Division|Second Division]]. In the 1938/39 season the Portuguese Championship was renamed [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] (TP) and the 2nd Division championship was created.\n\n===The Golden Years===\n\nIn 1951/52 Lusitano became National Champion of the [[Segunda Divis\u00e3o]], after winning the final pole of the competition with [[Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal]], [[Torreense]] and [[U. de Coimbra]]. It was a sublime moment in the history of the club.\nThe last game, refereed by A. Calheiros, took place in Campo Estrela on 6 January 1952 and ended with a 0-0 draw between Eborians and Sadinos. Lusitano lined-up with the following roster: [[Dinis Vital]]; Eduardo and Soeiro; Madeira, Valle and Paulo; Pepe, Di Paola, Teixeira da Silva, Duarte and Domingo.\nThe entrance of the club in the greater division of Portuguese football was commemorated all around the city. The famous [[Pra\u00e7a do Geraldo]] received countless expressions of joy.\n[[\u00c9vora]] entered the map of Portuguese football. The winning coach, was former [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Banfield|Banfield]] argentinian coach Anselmo Pisa.\nOn 28 September [[1952\u201353 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1952]] [[Dinis Vital]], Soeiro, [[Paix\u00e3o]], Madeira, Valle, Paulo, Flora, [[Vicente Di Paola|Di Paola]], [[Patalino]], Batalha and Duarte debuted in the competition. In the 1952/53 season Lusitano achieved a record that was only beaten the by [https://www.fcfamalicao.pt/ Famalic\u00e3o] in the 2019/2020 season, i.e., never a newly promoted team was leading the table by the 5th matchday.[https://www.ojogo.pt/multimedia/videos/interior/cinco-jornada-disputadas-e-ai-esta-o-feito-inedito-do-famalicao-11306951.html]\nAlso in 1952 the Players Statute was approved. The document contained the rights and duties of the players, defined the prizes policy and praised correctness, loyalty and fair play.\nAlso in the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] the club surprised, by eliminating [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]] in the quarter-finals.\nA 3-3 draw in [[1953\u201354 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1953/54]], in \u00c9vora, against Sporting and the victory against Porto by 2-0 encouraged leaders and supporters.\nIn the 1954/55 season, already under the command of C\u00e2ndido Tavares, the club finished 10th place in the [[Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], having beaten Sporting 2-1. Also FC Porto with [[Barrigana]], [[Hern\u00e2ni Ferreira da Silva|Hern\u00e2ni]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Pedroto|Pedroto]] would crash in Campo Estrela 2-1. \"''Porto scored first yesterday in \u00c9vora - but did not escape defeat ...''\" - titled [[A Bola]].In the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]], wins 2-1 against V. de Guimar\u00e3es and 2-0 against [[FC Porto]].\nIn [[1955\u201356 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1955/56]], Lusitano finished 8th. Under the guidance of Severiano Correia, the base team included [[Dinis Vital]], Polido, Paix\u00e3o, Jos\u00e9 da Costa, [[Carlos Fal\u00e9|Fal\u00e9]], Vicente, Batalha, Vieira, [[Patalino]], Cara\u00e7a and [[Jos\u00e9 Pedro Bil\u00e9u|Jos\u00e9 Pedro]]. Special highlight for the 1-1 draw against Sporting in \u00c9vora, in a game that inaugurated the new pitch of Campo Estrela. In the [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz]] a 1-1 draw against [[Benfica]].\n\nIn the [[1956\u201357 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1956/57]] season, led by [[Otto Bumbel]], the club achieved its best performance in the biggest event of Portuguese football, reaching an exceptional 5th place that would today give access to the Europa League ...\nWon 13 out of 26 matches and recorded impressive results during the competition: wins in Evora by 3-2 against Porto (Flora hat-trick) and 2-1 against Sporting, as well as 1-1 draws in [[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade (1956)|Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] and 2 -2 at the [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz]].\nIn the 1957/58 season, already under the guidance of Lorenzo Ausina, Lusitano obtained a resounding victory against Benfica by 4-0, in the 8th matchday, at Campo Estrela.\nIn 1958/59, high note for the draws 0-0 and 3-3 at Campo Estrela, against Benfica and Sporting, respectively and return to the Cup semi-finals (eliminated by FC Porto).\nOtto Bumbel returned to the club in 61/62, but the league streak confirmed the downward trend (12th place with 20 pts). Highlight, in any case, for another victory against Sporting, in the knockout round of the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|Cup]] (4-1).\nAlready under the command of Josef Fabian, in 1962/63 Lusitano obtained an honorable 7th place with 23 points. In terms of [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] the club obtained its biggest victory so far in official games, beating Portalegrense, in the first round, in Evora, 10-0.\n\nFinally, the [[1965\u201366 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1965/66]] season would be a sad memory for the club and to all its fans. Lusitano said goodbye to the 1st Division, accompanied by [[Barreirense]], finishing 13th, with only 14 pts, losing 16 of the 26 games played.\n\nThey had 14 consecutive seasons in which \u00c9vora was at the center of the great decisions of national football, mobilizing crowds whenever the big teams, would come to play at the ''Museum City''. The roads were embellished and all paths converged towards the Campo Estrela. The pilgrimage was indescribable.\n\nIt was in this golden period for Portuguese football that Sporting won the [[1964 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1963\u201364 Cup Winners Cup]], that Benfica reached its apogee in Europe with the double victory in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] ([[1960\u201361 European Cup|1960/61]] and [[1961\u201362 European Cup|1961/62]]) and that the national team reached its best classification ever in a football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] (3rd place in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]).<ref>''Centen\u00e1rio - A Hist\u00f3ria do Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube'', by Carlos Perdig\u00e3o, trabalho exclusivo para o jornal ''A Defesa''</ref><ref>https://arquivista.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/epoca-196263-primeira-divisao/#more-102</ref>\n\n===The dark 1970s===\nLusitano spent the rest of the 1960s in the [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] until relegation to the third tier by the end of the 1969/70 season. A period of several promotions and relegations between the third and second division followed without really contending access back to the top tier.\n\n===Almost Back in the 80`s===\nIn the 1979/80 season Lusitano had a great season in the [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] fighting shoulder to shoulder with [[Amora F.C.|Amora FC]] coached by [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]`s father Mourinho F\u00e9lix and overcoming clubs such as [[S.C. Farense|Farense]], [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora|Estrela da Amadora]], [[C.D. Nacional|Nacional]], [[F.C. Barreirense|Barreirense]] and rivals Juventude. Lusitano started the season with a loss and two draws (including a 0-0 draw against eventual winners Amora FC. However wins against Sacavenense, Nacional and Estrela da Amadora was well as away draws against Farense and [[G.D. Fabril|Fabril]] boosted the team a great second round of the season. Amora FC eventually gained direct promotion by finnshing 1st and actually became Segunda Divis\u00e3o champions, while Lusitano had to enter the promotion play-offs against Central and North zones runners-up Acad\u00e9mico de Viseu and Fafe. Lusitano lost both matches against Acad\u00e9mico de Viseu and the match in Fafe, thereby failing promotion back to the Primeira Divis\u00e3o.\n\nAfter a 9th place the following season (in which rivals Juventude nearly got promotion to the Primeira Divis\u00e3o) and a 3rd place in 1981/82 (only behind [[C.S. Mar\u00edtimo|Mar\u00edtimo]] and Farense) Lusitano announced that [[Dinis Vital]], former captain and the club's main symbol would be appointed as manager for the 1982/83 season. Vital had nearly taken rivals Juventude to the Primeira Divis\u00e3o in 1981 and took [[G.C. Alcoba\u00e7a|Gin\u00e1sio de Alcoba\u00e7a]] to their only top tier presence in 1982. Vital left Gin\u00e1sio de Alcoba\u00e7a in the first division and returned to the club.\n\nThe season did not seem easy with former Portuguese champions [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] (playing in the second division for the first time in history) Farense, Olhanense, Nacional, Uni\u00e3o da Madeira, Barreirense, [[Atl\u00e9tico Clube de Portugal|Atl\u00e9tico]] and Juventude. However Lusitano had an amazing season, actually beating Belenenses (1-0) in the Campo Estrela and losing only twice in \u00c9vora against Farense and Nacional. However, Lusitano struggled with difficulties in away matches, winning only twice. Farense, coached by [[Hristo Mladenov]] won the series and gained direct promotion to the top tier, in addition to becoming [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] champions, while Lusitano had to face the play-offs once again. This time the opponents were [[S.C. Espinho|Sporting de Espinho]], Vizela and another historic club [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra \u2013 O.A.F.|Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra]]. Notwithstanding a Lusitano victory in [[Coimbra]] (1-2), Sporting de Espinho with former Benfica striker [[M\u00e1rio Moinhos|Mo\u00ednhos]] was too strong winning both matches against the Eborians and gaining access to [[Primeira Divis\u00e3o|Primeira Divisao]] via play-off.\n\nDinis Vital left the club in the end of the season. He would still gain Farense's promotion in 1986, the year Lusitano was relegated to the third division. The club never again had real a fighting chance to return to the top flight.<ref>http://www.lusitanoginasioclube.com/index.php/historico-de-classificacoes/historico-de-seniores</ref>\n\n=== Wondering in the lower leagues ===\nBy 1990 Lusitano was playing the Segunda Divis\u00e3o once again, when the [[Portuguese Football Federation|FPF]] announced its intention to extinguish this competition and replace it with two new ones. The [[Segunda Liga]] (Divis\u00e3o de Honra) with no regional separation (second tier) and a II Division B (third tier) with a North, Central and South zones. Teams finishing in the top 7 in three zones of the [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] in 1990 would either obtain: (a) direct promotion to top tier (1st place), (b) access to the promotion playoffs (2nd place) or (c) access to the new Divis\u00e3o de Honra. Lusitano finished 12th and therefore was allocated to the also newly created II Division B (third tier), were it remained until 1995 (with a brief participation in the Third Division). However, the Third Division would be the club's destiny for the second half of the nineties.\n\nPromotion back to the II Division B in 2000/2001 put the club in severe economic difficulties. Also due to a disastrous political option by the FPF. According the regulations all the teams from Madeira and Azores were automatically allocated to the Southern series of the II B and Third Division. This would mean that rich clubs in the North and Centre of Portugal would only need to travel a few kilometers to play, poor teams from the South were forced to exhausting and expensive flights to the islands constantly throughout the mid-1990s and 2000s.<ref>http://soccerlibrary.free.fr/por_ft.pdf</ref>\n\n===Regional League, Decline and Insolvency===\n\nLusitano spent its 100th birthday with no professional football team registered.\n\nThe club was suspended in the 2011\u201312 season from entering any tier in the Portuguese football pyramid.<ref>[http://lusitano-ginasio-clube.blogspot.co.uk/p/seniores.html S\u00e9niores (Seniors)]; lusitano-ginasio-clube.blogspot.co.uk, 24 July 2012</ref> In 2013\u201314 they were allowed to start over in the [[\u00c9vora Football Association|\u00c9vora District League]] Divis\u00e3o de Honra S\u00e9rie A (regional second division, fifth division overall).\n\n===Rebirth and Creation of the SAD===\n\nOn July 14, 2016, the Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube, Futebol SAD (Sports Company) was created. The club transferred the management of professional senior football rights to this newly created entity. The main goal was to bring Lusitano back to the big stage once again.\n\n===Recent successes===\n\nAfter rebirth the club has mostly competed in the regional leagues until promotion to the [[Campeonato de Portugal (league)|Campeonato de Portugal]] by the end of the 2018/19 season. After the return of professional football in 2013 Lusitano were \u00c9vora FA Champions in 2018/19, won the \u00c9vora FA Cup three times in a row 2016, 2017 and 2018, as well as the \u00c9vora FA Super Cup 2017 and 2019.\n\n==Stadiums==\n\n===Campo Estrela===\n\nThe Campo Estrela was inaugurated June 15, 1914. It is the fourth oldest football pitch in the country still existing, only surpassed by the [[Est\u00e1dio do Bessa|Bessa]] (1911) and the [[Campo da Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o]] (1912) both in [[Porto|Oporto]] and by the Tapadinha in Lisbon, opened in the same year of 1914.\n\nThe stadium is a landmark of [[\u00c9vora]] and contrarily to popular belief not only associated with Lusitano. The genesis of its construction is umbilically linked to the outbreak of sport in the city and was the first permanent site dedicated to the practice of ''athletic sports'', as it was called. The construction initiative came from the '''Ateneu Sport Eborense''', founded June 15, 1913 by a group of athletes who had left '''Sport Vit\u00f3ria Acad\u00e9mico''' and who leased the site for fifteen years to install a football and athletics facility (to a lesser extent shooting and equestrianism). Over the years football clearly surpassed all other sports. In 1922 the Ateneu folded and its president, Em\u00eddio Crujeira de Carvalho, handed over all its assets and sports equipment to Lusitano, thereby terminating the lease. In 1926 the site was leased by another club, the '''Gin\u00e1sio Club Eborense''' and suffered some abandonment. This club also folded 2 years latter and Lusitano started leasing the Campo Estrela for its participation in the [[Campeonato de Portugal (1922-1938)|Campeonato de Portugal]].\n\nIn 1931, former president and lawyer M\u00e1rio Ribeiro de Lemos planned an operation for the purchase of the Campo Estrela for 30,000 [[Escudo|PTE]]. The money came directly from the pocket of M\u00e1rio Ribeiro de Lemos and as soon as the public deed was executed on February 3, 1931, recovery, enlargement and improvement works started immediately over four years. In 1935 it was completely unrecognizable. The pitch was excellent and two locker rooms had been built, with 4 showers each, and a third on for the referees to be isolated from the players. A national innovation. There was a storage room to store various materials. Six rows of wooden benches with a capacity of more than 300 people in a length of more than 60 meters, which were completed by structures for the opening of 18 cabins. It was by far the best field in the [[Alentejo]] and one of the best in Portugal.\n\nCampo Estrela also knew its golden period during the 14 years in which Lusitano remained in the I Division (1952-1966). At the end of 1953 the wooden benches were destroyed and replaced by stone ones, stretched out to the length of the field and comfortable cabins were installed. In addition to the improvements a complete medical station and excellent sanitary facilities for dames and gentlemen were also available.\n\nOn May 25, 1955, the grass pitch was opened in a league match against Sporting (1-1-draw). \u00c9vora became the 5th city in the country to have a grass field after Lisbon ([[Est\u00e1dio Nacional|National Stadium]], [[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade (1956)|Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]], [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz (1954)|Est\u00e1dio da Luz]], [[Campo das Sal\u00e9sias]]), Porto ([[Est\u00e1dio das Antas]] and [[Est\u00e1dio do Lima]]), Coimbra and [[Est\u00e1dio 1\u00ba de Maio|Braga]]. Lusitano was also the fifth club to have a grass pitch, given that the National Stadium and the 28 de Maio Stadium were State-owned.\n\nOn April 4, 1956, the Campo Estrela saw its first international matches by welcoming the 2nd. day of the [[NATO]] International Tournament receiving the matches between Italy and Turkey and between Portugal and Egypt. The other two days were disputed in Lisbon and in Porto. The following year two English lady's teams came to Portugal to present the practice of football among ladies which was taking its first steps abroad. Again Lisbon, Porto and \u00c9vora were the chosen cities.\n\nIn 1964 a mysterious virus destroyed the grass entirely.<ref>http://cinco149.rssing.com/chan-14147664/all_p29.html</ref>\n\n===Silveirinha Sports Complex===\n\nLusitano was supposed to start playing their home matches at the Complexo Desportivo do Lusitano, commonly known as Silveirinha, which was built in 2006 and is able to hold a [[seating capacity]] of 10,000.<ref>[http://www.zerozero.pt/estadio.php?id=943 Complexo Desportivo do Lusitano]; ZeroZero, 24 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=260274 Constru\u00e7\u00e3o do novo complexo de \u00c9vora inicia-se amanh\u00e3 (Construction of the new complex of Evora starts tomorrow)]; [[Record (newspaper)|Record]], 6 February 2006</ref> However, serious financial difficulties by the clube led to an insolvency proceeding which resulted in the abandonment of the Silveirinha facility.\n\nOn the 27 May 2006, Complexo Desportivo do Lusitano hosted an international friendly match between [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Cape Verde national football team|Cape Verde]] in preparation for Portugal participating in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in which Portugal won 4\u20131.<ref>[http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=270251 Portugal-Cabo Verde realiza-se \u00e0s 18 horas (Portugal-Cape Verde takes place at 18:00)]; [[Record (newspaper)|Record]], 19 May 2006</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/portugal/5023588.stm Portugal 4\u20131 Cape Verde Islands]; [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2006</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n\n===Rivalry with Juventude de \u00c9vora===\n\nLusitano's main rival is [[Juventude Sport Clube]]. The clubs are neighbours and the stadiums are confining properties. Literally a few inches from each other. Juventude was founded in 1918, seven years after Lusitano. The clube met many times in different divisions.\n\nThe first clash recorded between Lusitano and Juventude was the Brito Paes-Sarmento Beires Cup on May 1, 1924. Ant\u00f3nio Jacinto da Silva Brito Paes was an adventurer pilot who tried a direct flight to [[Madeira]] in 1922 on a plane called the ''Dark Knight''. Guided by a mere compass, the plane crashed on the way, being rescued by a British ship. The intrepid pilot was now planning a journey to [[Macao]] in the ''P\u00e1tria'', a  Breguet 16 Bn2.  The trophy was offered by a committee of merchants of \u00c9vora to fund this expedition and to be played, in the Ateneu field, between the Champions of the \u00c9vora FA, Lusitano Futebol Club and the ''well aligned eleven'' of Juventude Sport.<ref>Not\u00edcias d'\u00c9vora, Year XXIV, No. 6997, April 29, 1924</ref> Tickets could be purchased for the price of 2.50 [[Escudo|PTE]] (seated) and 1.50 [[Escudo|PTE]] . Juventude Sport Club won 2-1, thus winning the Brito Paes-Sarmento Beires Cup.<ref>http://www.evora.net/cice/memoria/results_image.asp?mnuImg=D0CD36C7-40AB-48B2-BD5D-7462827D929B</ref>\n\nLusitanists usually call rival supporters Cacaru\u00e7as or Rasga-Roupa, while the Juventudists call Lusitano supporters Erban\u00e1rios (Herbalists) due to the green and white colours.\n==Current squad==\n<!--

Clube. Please do not add too much detail. -->\n'''Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube,''' [[Order of Prince Henry|MHIH]], also commonly known as '''Lusitano de \u00c9vora''' (abbrev. '''Lusit. \u00c9vora'''), is a Portuguese [[sports club]] club based in [[\u00c9vora]],<ref>[http://www.zerozero.pt/local.php?id=153 \u00c9vora]; ZeroZero, 24 July 2012</ref> that competes in Serie D of [[Campeonato de Portugal (league)|Campeonato de Portugal]], third tier of Portuguese football. Founded on 11 November 1911 by a group of high school and commercial school youngsters, in the house of professor D\u00e2maso Sim\u00f5es at Rua das Fontes, No. 3 in \u00c9vora as ''Lusitano Acad\u00e9mico'', it subsequently became ''Lusitano Futebol'' and finally Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube in 1925. The club's home ground is the [[Campo Estrela]] in \u00c9vora, purchased in 1931.\n\nLusitano GC entered the [[1952\u201353 Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], finishing up 7th in their first season ever. The club spent 14 consecutive seasons in the [[Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], its major period of success in the 1950s and 1960s, earning an honorable 5th place in 1956/57, and reaching the semi-finals of the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] twice. After relegation in 1966 the club went through a period of decline, never regaining access to the Portuguese top flight ever again and even descending to regional championships. The club is still today in the top 30 of teams with the most presences in the Portuguese League.\n\nLusitano establish a SAD (''Sociedade An\u00f3nima Desportiva)'' in 2016 and won the 2018/2019 Liga Century 21-Porta do Alentejo, thus earning promotion back to national football.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Lusitano\" is derived from ''[[Lusitania]]'', the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name for the province corresponding to the current territory of Portugal south of the Douro river and to modern day Spanish region of Extremadura.\n\n===Motto===\nThe club's motto is ''Fazer Forte Fraca Gente'' (Portuguese for Making the Weak Stronger).\n\n===Foundation===\nThe club was founded November 11, 1911 (''11-11-1911'' in a sport played with 11 players). In addition, its first headquarters was in Travessa da Bola No. 11, in \u00c9vora.\n\n=== First Victories ===\nIn 1917/18 Lusitano won its first Evora FA championship. It would win many district championships afterwards (1921/22, 1922/23, 1926/27, 1927/28, 1928/29. 1930/31, 1932/33, 1933/34, 1934/35, 1939/40, 1940/41.<ref>http://arquivista-evora.blogspot.com/</ref> \n\nThe year 1925 proved decisive for the future of the club. At the initiative of historical leaders such as Jos\u00e9 Benchimol, Napole\u00e3o Palma, Alberto da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and Ant\u00f3nio Prazeres, the club was restructured, the facilities were reorganized and its action extended to other modalities, with emphasis on gymnastics that would reach great projection. Lusitano started betting on a concept of full personal development, involving the man and the athlete, a design that would be the hallmark of all those who have passed through their teams over the years.<ref>https://lusitano-ginasio-clube.blogspot.com/2011/11/centenario-historia-do-lusitano-ginasio.html</ref>\n\nBetween 1929/30 and 1933/34 the Eborians competed in the [[Campeonato de Portugal (1922-1938)|Campeonato de Portugal]], without recording significant results. The club obtained its best classification in 1930/31, reaching the final quarter lost to [[S.C. Salgueiros|Salgueiros]]. \n\nIn 1931 the mythical Campo Estrela was purchased. On November 6, 1932, Lusitano beat Benfica 4-1 in Evora in a private game. Between 1934/35 and 1937/38 the club was one of the forerunners of the League Championship of the [[Portuguese Second Division|Second Division]]. In the 1938/39 season the Portuguese Championship was renamed [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] (TP) and the 2nd Division championship was created.\n\n===The Golden Years===\n\nIn 1951/52 Lusitano became National Champion of the [[Segunda Divis\u00e3o]], after winning the final pole of the competition with [[Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal]], [[Torreense]] and [[U. de Coimbra]]. It was a sublime moment in the history of the club.\nThe last game, refereed by A. Calheiros, took place in Campo Estrela on 6 January 1952 and ended with a 0-0 draw between Eborians and Sadinos. Lusitano lined-up with the following roster: [[Dinis Vital]]; Eduardo and Soeiro; Madeira, Valle and Paulo; Pepe, Di Paola, Teixeira da Silva, Duarte and Domingo.\nThe entrance of the club in the greater division of Portuguese football was commemorated all around the city. The famous [[Pra\u00e7a do Geraldo]] received countless expressions of joy.\n[[\u00c9vora]] entered the map of Portuguese football. The winning coach, was former [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Banfield|Banfield]] argentinian coach Anselmo Pisa.\nOn 28 September [[1952\u201353 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1952]] [[Dinis Vital]], Soeiro, [[Paix\u00e3o]], Madeira, Valle, Paulo, Flora, [[Vicente Di Paola|Di Paola]], [[Patalino]], Batalha and Duarte debuted in the competition. In the 1952/53 season Lusitano achieved a record that was only beaten the by [https://www.fcfamalicao.pt/ Famalic\u00e3o] in the 2019/2020 season, i.e., never a newly promoted team was leading the table by the 5th matchday.[https://www.ojogo.pt/multimedia/videos/interior/cinco-jornada-disputadas-e-ai-esta-o-feito-inedito-do-famalicao-11306951.html]\nAlso in 1952 the Players Statute was approved. The document contained the rights and duties of the players, defined the prizes policy and praised correctness, loyalty and fair play.\nAlso in the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] the club surprised, by eliminating [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]] in the quarter-finals.\nA 3-3 draw in [[1953\u201354 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1953/54]], in \u00c9vora, against Sporting and the victory against Porto by 2-0 encouraged leaders and supporters.\nIn the 1954/55 season, already under the command of C\u00e2ndido Tavares, the club finished 10th place in the [[Primeira Divis\u00e3o]], having beaten Sporting 2-1. Also FC Porto with [[Barrigana]], [[Hern\u00e2ni Ferreira da Silva|Hern\u00e2ni]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Pedroto|Pedroto]] would crash in Campo Estrela 2-1. \"''Porto scored first yesterday in \u00c9vora - but did not escape defeat ...''\" - titled [[A Bola]].In the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]], wins 2-1 against V. de Guimar\u00e3es and 2-0 against [[FC Porto]].\nIn [[1955\u201356 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1955/56]], Lusitano finished 8th. Under the guidance of Severiano Correia, the base team included [[Dinis Vital]], Polido, Paix\u00e3o, Jos\u00e9 da Costa, [[Carlos Fal\u00e9|Fal\u00e9]], Vicente, Batalha, Vieira, [[Patalino]], Cara\u00e7a and [[Jos\u00e9 Pedro Bil\u00e9u|Jos\u00e9 Pedro]]. Special highlight for the 1-1 draw against Sporting in \u00c9vora, in a game that inaugurated the new pitch of Campo Estrela. In the [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz]] a 1-1 draw against [[Benfica]].\n\nIn the [[1956\u201357 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1956/57]] season, led by [[Otto Bumbel]], the club achieved its best performance in the biggest event of Portuguese football, reaching an exceptional 5th place that would today give access to the Europa League ...\nWon 13 out of 26 matches and recorded impressive results during the competition: wins in Evora by 3-2 against Porto (Flora hat-trick) and 2-1 against Sporting, as well as 1-1 draws in [[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade (1956)|Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]] and 2 -2 at the [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz]].\nIn the 1957/58 season, already under the guidance of Lorenzo Ausina, Lusitano obtained a resounding victory against Benfica by 4-0, in the 8th matchday, at Campo Estrela.\nIn 1958/59, high note for the draws 0-0 and 3-3 at Campo Estrela, against Benfica and Sporting, respectively and return to the Cup semi-finals (eliminated by FC Porto).\nOtto Bumbel returned to the club in 61/62, but the league streak confirmed the downward trend (12th place with 20 pts). Highlight, in any case, for another victory against Sporting, in the knockout round of the [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|Cup]] (4-1).\nAlready under the command of Josef Fabian, in 1962/63 Lusitano obtained an honorable 7th place with 23 points. In terms of [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]] the club obtained its biggest victory so far in official games, beating Portalegrense, in the first round, in Evora, 10-0.\n\nFinally, the [[1965\u201366 Primeira Divis\u00e3o|1965/66]] season would be a sad memory for the club and to all its fans. Lusitano said goodbye to the 1st Division, accompanied by [[Barreirense]], finishing 13th, with only 14 pts, losing 16 of the 26 games played.\n\nThey had 14 consecutive seasons in which \u00c9vora was at the center of the great decisions of national football, mobilizing crowds whenever the big teams, would come to play at the ''Museum City''. The roads were embellished and all paths converged towards the Campo Estrela. The pilgrimage was indescribable.\n\nIt was in this golden period for Portuguese football that Sporting won the [[1964 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1963\u201364 Cup Winners Cup]], that Benfica reached its apogee in Europe with the double victory in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] ([[1960\u201361 European Cup|1960/61]] and [[1961\u201362 European Cup|1961/62]]) and that the national team reached its best classification ever in a football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] (3rd place in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]).<ref>''Centen\u00e1rio - A Hist\u00f3ria do Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube'', by Carlos Perdig\u00e3o, trabalho exclusivo para o jornal ''A Defesa''</ref><ref>https://arquivista.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/epoca-196263-primeira-divisao/#more-102</ref>\n\n===The dark 1970s===\nLusitano spent the rest of the 1960s in the [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] until relegation to the third tier by the end of the 1969/70 season. A period of several promotions and relegations between the third and second division followed without really contending access back to the top tier.\n\n===Almost Back in the 80`s===\nIn the 1979/80 season Lusitano had a great season in the [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] fighting shoulder to shoulder with [[Amora F.C.|Amora FC]] coached by [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]`s father Mourinho F\u00e9lix and overcoming clubs such as [[S.C. Farense|Farense]], [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora|Estrela da Amadora]], [[C.D. Nacional|Nacional]], [[F.C. Barreirense|Barreirense]] and rivals Juventude. Lusitano started the season with a loss and two draws (including a 0-0 draw against eventual winners Amora FC. However wins against Sacavenense, Nacional and Estrela da Amadora was well as away draws against Farense and [[G.D. Fabril|Fabril]] boosted the team a great second round of the season. Amora FC eventually gained direct promotion by finnshing 1st and actually became Segunda Divis\u00e3o champions, while Lusitano had to enter the promotion play-offs against Central and North zones runners-up Acad\u00e9mico de Viseu and Fafe. Lusitano lost both matches against Acad\u00e9mico de Viseu and the match in Fafe, thereby failing promotion back to the Primeira Divis\u00e3o.\n\nAfter a 9th place the following season (in which rivals Juventude nearly got promotion to the Primeira Divis\u00e3o) and a 3rd place in 1981/82 (only behind [[C.S. Mar\u00edtimo|Mar\u00edtimo]] and Farense) Lusitano announced that [[Dinis Vital]], former captain and the club's main symbol would be appointed as manager for the 1982/83 season. Vital had nearly taken rivals Juventude to the Primeira Divis\u00e3o in 1981 and took [[G.C. Alcoba\u00e7a|Gin\u00e1sio de Alcoba\u00e7a]] to their only top tier presence in 1982. Vital left Gin\u00e1sio de Alcoba\u00e7a in the first division and returned to the club.\n\nThe season did not seem easy with former Portuguese champions [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] (playing in the second division for the first time in history) Farense, Olhanense, Nacional, Uni\u00e3o da Madeira, Barreirense, [[Atl\u00e9tico Clube de Portugal|Atl\u00e9tico]] and Juventude. However Lusitano had an amazing season, actually beating Belenenses (1-0) in the Campo Estrela and losing only twice in \u00c9vora against Farense and Nacional. However, Lusitano struggled with difficulties in away matches, winning only twice. Farense, coached by [[Hristo Mladenov]] won the series and gained direct promotion to the top tier, in addition to becoming [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] champions, while Lusitano had to face the play-offs once again. This time the opponents were [[S.C. Espinho|Sporting de Espinho]], Vizela and another historic club [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra \u2013 O.A.F.|Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra]]. Notwithstanding a Lusitano victory in [[Coimbra]] (1-2), Sporting de Espinho with former Benfica striker [[M\u00e1rio Moinhos|Mo\u00ednhos]] was too strong winning both matches against the Eborians and gaining access to [[Primeira Divis\u00e3o|Primeira Divisao]] via play-off.\n\nDinis Vital left the club in the end of the season. He would still gain Farense's promotion in 1986, the year Lusitano was relegated to the third division. The club never again had real a fighting chance to return to the top flight.<ref>http://www.lusitanoginasioclube.com/index.php/historico-de-classificacoes/historico-de-seniores</ref>\n\n=== Wondering in the lower leagues ===\nBy 1990 Lusitano was playing the Segunda Divis\u00e3o once again, when the [[Portuguese Football Federation|FPF]] announced its intention to extinguish this competition and replace it with two new ones. The [[Segunda Liga]] (Divis\u00e3o de Honra) with no regional separation (second tier) and a II Division B (third tier) with a North, Central and South zones. Teams finishing in the top 7 in three zones of the [[Portuguese Second Division|Segunda Divis\u00e3o]] in 1990 would either obtain: (a) direct promotion to top tier (1st place), (b) access to the promotion playoffs (2nd place) or (c) access to the new Divis\u00e3o de Honra. Lusitano finished 12th and therefore was allocated to the also newly created II Division B (third tier), were it remained until 1995 (with a brief participation in the Third Division). However, the Third Division would be the club's destiny for the second half of the nineties.\n\nPromotion back to the II Division B in 2000/2001 put the club in severe economic difficulties. Also due to a disastrous political option by the FPF. According the regulations all the teams from Madeira and Azores were automatically allocated to the Southern series of the II B and Third Division. This would mean that rich clubs in the North and Centre of Portugal would only need to travel a few kilometers to play, poor teams from the South were forced to exhausting and expensive flights to the islands constantly throughout the mid-1990s and 2000s.<ref>http://soccerlibrary.free.fr/por_ft.pdf</ref>\n\n===Regional League, Decline and Insolvency===\n\nLusitano spent its 100th birthday with no professional football team registered.\n\nThe club was suspended in the 2011\u201312 season from entering any tier in the Portuguese football pyramid.<ref>[http://lusitano-ginasio-clube.blogspot.co.uk/p/seniores.html S\u00e9niores (Seniors)]; lusitano-ginasio-clube.blogspot.co.uk, 24 July 2012</ref> In 2013\u201314 they were allowed to start over in the [[\u00c9vora Football Association|\u00c9vora District League]] Divis\u00e3o de Honra S\u00e9rie A (regional second division, fifth division overall).\n\n===Rebirth and Creation of the SAD===\n\nOn July 14, 2016, the Lusitano Gin\u00e1sio Clube, Futebol SAD (Sports Company) was created. The club transferred the management of professional senior football rights to this newly created entity. The main goal was to bring Lusitano back to the big stage once again.\n\n===Recent successes===\n\nAfter rebirth the club has mostly competed in the regional leagues until promotion to the [[Campeonato de Portugal (league)|Campeonato de Portugal]] by the end of the 2018/19 season. After the return of professional football in 2013 Lusitano were \u00c9vora FA Champions in 2018/19, won the \u00c9vora FA Cup three times in a row 2016, 2017 and 2018, as well as the \u00c9vora FA Super Cup 2017 and 2019.\n\n==Stadiums==\n\n===Campo Estrela===\n\nThe Campo Estrela was inaugurated June 15, 1914. It is the fourth oldest football pitch in the country still existing, only surpassed by the [[Est\u00e1dio do Bessa|Bessa]] (1911) and the [[Campo da Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o]] (1912) both in [[Porto|Oporto]] and by the Tapadinha in Lisbon, opened in the same year of 1914.\n\nThe stadium is a landmark of [[\u00c9vora]] and contrarily to popular belief not only associated with Lusitano. The genesis of its construction is umbilically linked to the outbreak of sport in the city and was the first permanent site dedicated to the practice of ''athletic sports'', as it was called. The construction initiative came from the '''Ateneu Sport Eborense''', founded June 15, 1913 by a group of athletes who had left '''Sport Vit\u00f3ria Acad\u00e9mico''' and who leased the site for fifteen years to install a football and athletics facility (to a lesser extent shooting and equestrianism). Over the years football clearly surpassed all other sports. In 1922 the Ateneu folded and its president, Em\u00eddio Crujeira de Carvalho, handed over all its assets and sports equipment to Lusitano, thereby terminating the lease. In 1926 the site was leased by another club, the '''Gin\u00e1sio Club Eborense''' and suffered some abandonment. This club also folded 2 years latter and Lusitano started leasing the Campo Estrela for its participation in the [[Campeonato de Portugal (1922-1938)|Campeonato de Portugal]].\n\nIn 1931, former president and lawyer M\u00e1rio Ribeiro de Lemos planned an operation for the purchase of the Campo Estrela for 30,000 [[Escudo|PTE]]. The money came directly from the pocket of M\u00e1rio Ribeiro de Lemos and as soon as the public deed was executed on February 3, 1931, recovery, enlargement and improvement works started immediately over four years. In 1935 it was completely unrecognizable. The pitch was excellent and two locker rooms had been built, with 4 showers each, and a third on for the referees to be isolated from the players. A national innovation. There was a storage room to store various materials. Six rows of wooden benches with a capacity of more than 300 people in a length of more than 60 meters, which were completed by structures for the opening of 18 cabins. It was by far the best field in the [[Alentejo]] and one of the best in Portugal.\n\nCampo Estrela also knew its golden period during the 14 years in which Lusitano remained in the I Division (1952-1966). At the end of 1953 the wooden benches were destroyed and replaced by stone ones, stretched out to the length of the field and comfortable cabins were installed. In addition to the improvements a complete medical station and excellent sanitary facilities for dames and gentlemen were also available.\n\nOn May 25, 1955, the grass pitch was opened in a league match against Sporting (1-1-draw). \u00c9vora became the 5th city in the country to have a grass field after Lisbon ([[Est\u00e1dio Nacional|National Stadium]], [[Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade (1956)|Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade]], [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz (1954)|Est\u00e1dio da Luz]], [[Campo das Sal\u00e9sias]]), Porto ([[Est\u00e1dio das Antas]] and [[Est\u00e1dio do Lima]]), Coimbra and [[Est\u00e1dio 1\u00ba de Maio|Braga]]. Lusitano was also the fifth club to have a grass pitch, given that the National Stadium and the 28 de Maio Stadium were State-owned.\n\nOn April 4, 1956, the Campo Estrela saw its first international matches by welcoming the 2nd. day of the [[NATO]] International Tournament receiving the matches between Italy and Turkey and between Portugal and Egypt. The other two days were disputed in Lisbon and in Porto. The following year two English lady's teams came to Portugal to present the practice of football among ladies which was taking its first steps abroad. Again Lisbon, Porto and \u00c9vora were the chosen cities.\n\nIn 1964 a mysterious virus destroyed the grass entirely.<ref>http://cinco149.rssing.com/chan-14147664/all_p29.html</ref>\n\n===Silveirinha Sports Complex===\n\nLusitano was supposed to start playing their home matches at the Complexo Desportivo do Lusitano, commonly known as Silveirinha, which was built in 2006 and is able to hold a [[seating capacity]] of 10,000.<ref>[http://www.zerozero.pt/estadio.php?id=943 Complexo Desportivo do Lusitano]; ZeroZero, 24 July 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=260274 Constru\u00e7\u00e3o do novo complexo de \u00c9vora inicia-se amanh\u00e3 (Construction of the new complex of Evora starts tomorrow)]; [[Record (newspaper)|Record]], 6 February 2006</ref> However, serious financial difficulties by the clube led to an insolvency proceeding which resulted in the abandonment of the Silveirinha facility.\n\nOn the 27 May 2006, Complexo Desportivo do Lusitano hosted an international friendly match between [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Cape Verde national football team|Cape Verde]] in preparation for Portugal participating in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in which Portugal won 4\u20131.<ref>[http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=270251 Portugal-Cabo Verde realiza-se \u00e0s 18 horas (Portugal-Cape Verde takes place at 18:00)]; [[Record (newspaper)|Record]], 19 May 2006</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/portugal/5023588.stm Portugal 4\u20131 Cape Verde Islands]; [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2006</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n\n===Rivalry with Juventude de \u00c9vora===\n\nLusitano's main rival is [[Juventude Sport Clube]]. The clubs are neighbours and the stadiums are confining properties. Literally a few inches from each other. Juventude was founded in 1918, seven years after Lusitano. The clube met many times in different divisions.\n\nThe first clash recorded between Lusitano and Juventude was the Brito Paes-Sarmento Beires Cup on May 1, 1924. Ant\u00f3nio Jacinto da Silva Brito Paes was an adventurer pilot who tried a direct flight to [[Madeira]] in 1922 on a plane called the ''Dark Knight''. Guided by a mere compass, the plane crashed on the way, being rescued by a British ship. The intrepid pilot was now planning a journey to [[Macao]] in the ''P\u00e1tria'', a  Breguet 16 Bn2.  The trophy was offered by a committee of merchants of \u00c9vora to fund this expedition and to be played, in the Ateneu field, between the Champions of the \u00c9vora FA, Lusitano Futebol Club and the ''well aligned eleven'' of Juventude Sport.<ref>Not\u00edcias d'\u00c9vora, Year XXIV, No. 6997, April 29, 1924</ref> Tickets could be purchased for the price of 2.50 [[Escudo|PTE]] (seated) and 1.50 [[Escudo|PTE]] . Juventude Sport Club won 2-1, thus winning the Brito Paes-Sarmento Beires Cup.<ref>http://www.evora.net/cice/memoria/results_image.asp?mnuImg=D0CD36C7-40AB-48B2-BD5D-7462827D929B</ref>\n\nLusitanists usually call rival supporters Cacaru\u00e7as or Rasga-Roupa, while the Juventudists call Lusitano supporters Erban\u00e1rios (Herbalists) due to the green and white colours.\n==Current squad==\n<!--

Two years later he moved to command a company in the 33rd Fusilier Regiment. In 1904 the General Staff sent him to [[Manchuria]] as an observer with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[Russo-Japanese War|their war]] with the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. During this time, he is remembered for breaching protocol in the presence of other foreign observers when a Japanese general refused to allow him on to a hill to watch a battle, leading him to respond that the general was \"a yellow-skin\" and that he was \"uncivilized if you don't let me go over that hill.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Guns of August|last=Tuchman|first=Barbara|publisher=Random House|year=1962|isbn=0-345-47609-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gunsofaugusttuch00tuch/page/80 80\u201381]|url=https://archive.org/details/gunsofaugusttuch00tuch/page/80}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to the Staff twenty months later, before being assigned as the first staff officer of the 1st Division, stationed in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[East Prussia]].  In 1911 he became an instructor at the War Academy for two years, before moving to the 112th Infantry Regiment, where he had a field and then a staff position; he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n==The World War==\n===Eighth Army===\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]] Hoffmann became the first general staff officer of the [[8th Army (German Empire)|German Eighth Army]], responsible for defending their eastern border from a Russian attack.  The bulk of the German Army, following the [[Schlieffen Plan]], was attempting to gain decisive victory in the west by knocking France out of the war. Russian mobilization had begun secretly before the declaration of war, so earlier than anticipated the Russian First Army invaded [[East Prussia]] across its eastern frontier, the Eighth Army attacked them unsuccessfully at the [[Battle of Gumbinnen]] on 20 August 1914.  Then they learned that the [[2nd Army (Russian Empire)|Russian Second Army]] was approaching their southern frontier in the west.  To avoid being cut off the alarmed Eighth Army commander, [[Maximilian von Prittwitz]], proposed to retreat over the [[Vistula|River Vistula]], abandoning East Prussia to the invaders.  He soon reconsidered and instead decided to move the bulk of his forces to block the Russian Second Army from reaching the Vistula, but he and his chief of staff had already been relieved in favor of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]].  Hoffmann knew Ludendorff well because they had been neighbors in the same building in Berlin for several years.\n\nThe two Russian armies were too far apart to readily aid one another, and the Germans could gauge their lack of coordination from intercepted radio messages. When Hindenburg and Ludendorff stepped off of their special train they announced that Eighth Army would be put into position to encircle and annihilate [[Alexander Samsonov]]'s Russian Second Army.  They succeeded, winning the crucial victory in the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], saving the rest of Germany from invasion.  Hoffmann saw the propaganda value of casting the German victory as long-awaited revenge for a nearby [[battle of Grunwald|medieval defeat]], so he suggested the engagement be named Tannenberg, though it actually took place much closer to [[Olsztyn|Allenstein]]. (Ludendorff also claims credit for the name,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ludendorff|first1=Erich|title=Ludendorff's own story|date=1919|volume=1|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=68}}</ref> though it was Hindenburg, having lost an ancestor at the earlier battle, who requested the kaiser to use it.) Next the Eighth Army turned east and mauled [[Paul von Rennenkampf]]'s [[1st Army (Russian Empire)|Russian First Army]] at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes]], freeing most of East Prussia.\n\n===Ninth Army and  ''Ober Ost''===\n[[File:LudendorffAndHoffmanEasternFront.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|General Erich Ludendorff (left) with Colonel Max Hoffmann on the Eastern Front, 1915-1916]]\n\nThen Hindenburg, Ludendorff and Hoffmann led a new Ninth Army in blocking a Russian attempt to invade German [[Silesia]], continuing the campaign after being given command of all German forces on the Eastern Front: they were designated as ''[[Ober Ost]]''. In the [[Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914)|Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] they ended the immediate threat by outflanking the Russians and capturing Poland's second city.  Hoffmann believed that if given the reinforcements they requested for the battle they might have knocked the Russians out of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=General Max|title=The war of lost opportunities|date=1999|publisher=Battery Press|location=Nashville TN|origyear=1924|pages=76\u201378}}</ref>  During the winter lull in the fighting, ''Ober Ost'' struggled unsuccessful to shift major operations eastward in the coming year, claiming that they could force the Russians out of the war by encircling their armies in the Polish salient.\n\n''Ober Ost'' began 1915 with a surprise attack in a snowstorm that encircled a Russian Army, completing the liberation of East Prussia and obtaining a foothold in Russia's Baltic provinces. Hoffmann believed that if allowed to continue this incursion they might have inflicted a major, perhaps mortal, defeat on the Russians.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, pp. 107\u2013109.</ref>  Instead they were ordered to stop in favor of a major thrust in the south of Poland at [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice and Tarn\u00f3w]] where a joint Austro-German army battered the Russians step by step out of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (Austro-Hungarian Poland).  To assist them  ''Ober Ost'' was ordered to mount similar head-on, costly attacks in northern Poland.  After the Russians evacuated Poland,  ''Ober Ost'' was permitted to continue thrusting into Russia's Baltic provinces. By the start of winter their headquarters were in the Lithuanian city of [[Kaunas|Kovno]]. Hoffmann saw to the construction a strong defensive line on the new front and visited all of their units, \"I have crawled through all the trenches... The mud is terrible.\"<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, p. 103.</ref>  Meanwhile, Ludendorff set up an administration for the occupied region.\n\nDuring the winter the Russians were finally able to arm their troops adequately.  In the spring masses of Russians attacked ''Ober Ost's'' entrenchments. The German lines held except for one segment that was vacated and then recaptured in April.  To exploit the successful defense ''Ober Ost'' pleaded for reinforcements to enable them to capture the fortress of [[Riga]] and to roll up the Russian armies in the north, but the Supreme Commander focused on his fruitless attacks on Verdun.  On 4 June the Russians [[Brusilov Offensive|attacked]] the Austro-Hungarian lines in the south.  In a few days the defenders lost 200,000 prisoners and the Russians penetrated through their fortifications.  ''Ober Ost'' sent reinforcements south and more had to come from the west. To Hoffmann, the Austrian front was \"like a mouth full of sensitive teeth.\"<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, p. 143.</ref>  At last in July Hindenburg's command was extended further south, including many of the Austro-Hungarians on the front.  Therefore, they moved their headquarters south to [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]].  When the Russians also renewed their attacks in the north, the German reserves in the east were a single cavalry brigade.  In addition to plugging holes along their long front, the staff was busy organizing training for the Austro-Hungarians they now commanded, whom the Russians were still pushing back.\n\n===Chief of the staff in the east===\n\nThe crisis worsened when [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] entered the war on the side of the Entente. Hindenburg and Ludendorff became the Supreme Commanders. Field Marshal [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]], whom Hoffmann regarded as \"a clever soldier and a distinguished superior officer\",<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 157.</ref> took command of three army groups that included both German and Austro-Hungarian troops and Hoffmann was elated to become his chief of staff with promotion to major general: \"I shall actually become an Excellenz!\".<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, '''1''', p. 146.</ref> He was supported by a highly competent staff.<ref>Trumpener, 2008, pp. 125-126.</ref>  Eventually, they commanded all of the forces of the [[Central Powers]] on the Eastern front: German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Bulgarian. Since he was no longer able to visit the front in person, he was assigned a General Staff officer, Major Wachenfeld, for this purpose.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 162.</ref> The Russians shifted their attacks to the south to support the [[Romania during World War I|Romanians]], who were beaten decisively by an army with troops from all of the Central Powers.  That autumn [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] died. His successor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]], who had been a cavalry officer, appointed himself commander-in-chief and replaced their able chief of staff with \"a more conciliatory personage\",<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 167.</ref> Hoffmann had a two-hour conversation in which the young emperor \"gave his opinion on military matters by which he displayed his great want of understanding in all he said.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 167.</ref>\n\nHe corresponded and met with political leaders: for example Dr. [[Wolfgang Kapp]] a founder of the right wing [[Deutsche Vaterlandspartei|Fatherland Party]] (who after the war led a [[Kapp Putsch|putsch]] that failed to overturn the Republic).<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, p. 166.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043c\u04305 (\u0411\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The entrance to the fortress at Brest-Litovsk, headquarters for the Eastern Front and the site of the peace negotiations]]\nWhen 1917 dawned it seemed that as a result of the battering the Russian infantry had suffered when attacking that now most were only willing to defend their positions. Then the [[February Revolution]] led to a new [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian government]] under [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Hoffmann wanted to attack, but was only permitted to use a single division to reduce a Russian [[bridgehead]]. In July Kerensky launched an [[Kerensky Offensive|offensive]] in Galicia, hoping to reinvigorate public support for the war. Hoffmann had anticipated the attack, and was eager to launch their counter-move. At first the Austro-Hungarians lost ground, but on 19 July Prince Leopold and Hoffmann were in a tower watching the Germans counterattack the flank of the Russian incursion, slicing through to the rear.  In a few days the Russians were driven out of Galicia, but further pursuit had to be delayed while railroads were repaired. Hoffmann was rewarded with the Oak Leaves for his ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''. On 1 September they attacked the [[battle of Jugla|Riga fortresses]], by throwing [[pontoon bridge]]s across the intervening river. They took Riga, but most of the defenders had slipped out.\n\nOn 26 November they received a wireless message from the new Russian Bolshevik government requesting an armistice.  They sent a delegation to Hoffmann's headquarters, after dining with them in the mess-room\u2014they included a peasant and a political assassin\u2014he was dismayed that they had been received as representing Russia.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 212.</ref>  He assisted Foreign Secretary [[Richard von K\u00fchlmann]] during the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ;  his fluent Russian was an asset. Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Ottokar Czernin]] found that \"The General [Hoffmann] combined expert knowledge and energy with a good deal of calm and ability, but also not a little of Prussian brutality....\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Czernin|first1=Count Ottokar|title=In the World War|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.39651|date=1919|publisher=Cassall|location=London|page=219}}</ref>  The negotiations dragged on;  the major sticking point was that the Russians would not be given back Poland, Lithuania, or [[Courland]], which the Central Powers maintained had opted for independence.\n\nIn December 1917 he was summoned to Berlin, where at lunch the Kaiser ordered him, despite his objections, to give his opinion regarding the post-war [[Germany\u2013Poland border|German\u2013Polish border]].  He favored taking from Poland a modest defensive strip, so they would acquire as few new Slav subjects as possible. The Supreme Commanders wanted much of Poland, so they were furious when the kaiser endorsed his viewpoint.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wheeller-Bennett|first1=John|title=Hindenburg.

Hoffmann wrote \"great men can also be very small sometimes.\"<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 215.</ref>\n\nAfter a break the negotiations were resumed with Foreign Commissar [[Leon Trotsky]] leading the Russian delegation; he stopped them from eating with the enemy. Hoffmann did not write any clause in the treaty, but Trotsky \"did not doubt for a single minute that ... General Hoffmann was the only element of serious reality in these negotiations.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=From October to Brest-Litovsk|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uB5YAAAAMAAJ|date=1919|publisher=The Socialist Publication Society|location=Brooklyn NY|page=87}}</ref> The Central Powers simultaneously negotiated with a delegation representing an independent [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukraine]].  In late January 1918, Trotsky returned to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] to consult about the Ukrainian problem.  When he returned a peace with the Ukrainians had been signed.  On 10 February Trotsky announced that Russia would consider the war at an end but would not sign the proposed treaty.  Eight days later the Eastern Army resumed its offensive, sweeping over the remainder of the Baltic provinces without opposition. After two days the Russians caved in: the Treaty was signed on 3 March 1918.  German troops marched into Ukraine to prop up the beleaguered independent government and also went further east into the [[Don River (Russia)|Don basin]] to obtain the coal to ship the grain they seized.\nHoffmann anticipated that the Crimea would become the German Riviera.<ref>Kitchen, 1976, p. 241.</ref>  The Supreme Commanders set up new administrations for Ukraine and the Baltic States, strikingly diminishing Prince Leopold's and Hoffmann's territorial sway\u2014they were left only with ''Ober Ost''.

The leader of the new, small [[Reichswehr|German Army]] was [[Hans von Seeckt]], who had quarreled with Hoffmann during the war.  Hoffmann was retired in March 1920.  He settled back in Berlin where he reconciled with Hindenburg at a personal meeting.  He and the industrialist Arnold Rechberg campaigned persistently trying to persuade the western powers to join together to overthrow the [[Soviet Union]].  He published his wartime memoirs and evaluations,<ref>Hoffmann, 1999.</ref> his views on Russia,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Max|title=An allen enden Moskau.

He was on the General Staff from 1899 to 1901 in the First Department (Russia and the Nordic States).  In 1901 he was promoted to captain and assigned as a staff officer to V Army Corps.  Two years later he moved to command a company in the 33rd Fusilier Regiment. In 1904 the General Staff sent him to [[Manchuria]] as an observer with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[Russo-Japanese War|their war]] with the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. During this time, he is remembered for breaching protocol in the presence of other foreign observers when a Japanese general refused to allow him on to a hill to watch a battle, leading him to respond that the general was \"a yellow-skin\" and that he was \"uncivilized if you don't let me go over that hill.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Guns of August|last=Tuchman|first=Barbara|publisher=Random House|year=1962|isbn=0-345-47609-3|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gunsofaugusttuch00tuch/page/80 80\u201381]|url=https://archive.org/details/gunsofaugusttuch00tuch/page/80}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to the Staff twenty months later, before being assigned as the first staff officer of the 1st Division, stationed in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[East Prussia]].  In 1911 he became an instructor at the War Academy for two years, before moving to the 112th Infantry Regiment, where he had a field and then a staff position; he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n==The World War==\n===Eighth Army===\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]] Hoffmann became the first general staff officer of the [[8th Army (German Empire)|German Eighth Army]], responsible for defending their eastern border from a Russian attack.  The bulk of the German Army, following the [[Schlieffen Plan]], was attempting to gain decisive victory in the west by knocking France out of the war. Russian mobilization had begun secretly before the declaration of war, so earlier than anticipated the Russian First Army invaded [[East Prussia]] across its eastern frontier, the Eighth Army attacked them unsuccessfully at the [[Battle of Gumbinnen]] on 20 August 1914.  Then they learned that the [[2nd Army (Russian Empire)|Russian Second Army]] was approaching their southern frontier in the west.  To avoid being cut off the alarmed Eighth Army commander, [[Maximilian von Prittwitz]], proposed to retreat over the [[Vistula|River Vistula]], abandoning East Prussia to the invaders.  He soon reconsidered and instead decided to move the bulk of his forces to block the Russian Second Army from reaching the Vistula, but he and his chief of staff had already been relieved in favor of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]].  Hoffmann knew Ludendorff well because they had been neighbors in the same building in Berlin for several years.\n\nThe two Russian armies were too far apart to readily aid one another, and the Germans could gauge their lack of coordination from intercepted radio messages. When Hindenburg and Ludendorff stepped off of their special train they announced that Eighth Army would be put into position to encircle and annihilate [[Alexander Samsonov]]'s Russian Second Army.  They succeeded, winning the crucial victory in the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], saving the rest of Germany from invasion.  Hoffmann saw the propaganda value of casting the German victory as long-awaited revenge for a nearby [[battle of Grunwald|medieval defeat]], so he suggested the engagement be named Tannenberg, though it actually took place much closer to [[Olsztyn|Allenstein]]. (Ludendorff also claims credit for the name,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ludendorff|first1=Erich|title=Ludendorff's own story|date=1919|volume=1|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=68}}</ref> though it was Hindenburg, having lost an ancestor at the earlier battle, who requested the kaiser to use it.) Next the Eighth Army turned east and mauled [[Paul von Rennenkampf]]'s [[1st Army (Russian Empire)|Russian First Army]] at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes]], freeing most of East Prussia.\n\n===Ninth Army and  ''Ober Ost''===\n[[File:LudendorffAndHoffmanEasternFront.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|General Erich Ludendorff (left) with Colonel Max Hoffmann on the Eastern Front, 1915-1916]]\n\nThen Hindenburg, Ludendorff and Hoffmann led a new Ninth Army in blocking a Russian attempt to invade German [[Silesia]], continuing the campaign after being given command of all German forces on the Eastern Front: they were designated as ''[[Ober Ost]]''. In the [[Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914)|Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] they ended the immediate threat by outflanking the Russians and capturing Poland's second city.  Hoffmann believed that if given the reinforcements they requested for the battle they might have knocked the Russians out of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=General Max|title=The war of lost opportunities|date=1999|publisher=Battery Press|location=Nashville TN|origyear=1924|pages=76\u201378}}</ref>  During the winter lull in the fighting, ''Ober Ost'' struggled unsuccessful to shift major operations eastward in the coming year, claiming that they could force the Russians out of the war by encircling their armies in the Polish salient.\n\n''Ober Ost'' began 1915 with a surprise attack in a snowstorm that encircled a Russian Army, completing the liberation of East Prussia and obtaining a foothold in Russia's Baltic provinces. Hoffmann believed that if allowed to continue this incursion they might have inflicted a major, perhaps mortal, defeat on the Russians.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, pp. 107-109.</ref>  Instead they were ordered to stop in favor of a major thrust in the south of Poland at [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice and Tarn\u00f3w]] where a joint Austro-German army battered the Russians step by step out of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] (Austro-Hungarian Poland).  To assist them  ''Ober Ost'' was ordered to mount similar head-on, costly attacks in northern Poland.  After the Russians evacuated Poland,  ''Ober Ost'' was permitted to continue thrusting into Russia's Baltic provinces. By the start of winter their headquarters were in the Lithuanian city of [[Kaunas|Kovno]]. Hoffmann saw to the construction a strong defensive line on the new front and visited all of their units, \"I have crawled though all the trenches... The mud is terrible.\"<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, p. 103.</ref>  Meanwhile, Ludendorff set up an administration for the occupied region.\n\nDuring the winter the Russians were finally able to arm their troops adequately.  In the spring masses of Russians attacked ''Ober Ost's'' entrenchments. The German lines held except for one segment that was vacated and then recaptured in April.  To exploit the successful defense ''Ober Ost'' pleaded for reinforcements to enable them to capture the fortress of [[Riga]] and to roll up the Russian armies in the north, but the Supreme Commander focused on his fruitless attacks on Verdun.  On 4 June the Russians [[Brusilov Offensive|attacked]] the Austro-Hungarian lines in the south.  In a few days the defenders lost 200,000 prisoners and the Russians penetrated though their fortifications.  ''Ober Ost'' sent reinforcements south and more had to come from the west. To Hoffmann, the Austrian front was \"like a mouth full of sensitive teeth.\"<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, p. 143.</ref>  At last in July Hindenburg's command was extended further south, including many of the Austro-Hungarians on the front.  Therefore, they moved their headquarters south to [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]].  When the Russians also renewed their attacks in the north, the German reserves in the east were a single cavalry brigade.  In addition to plugging holes along their long front, the staff was busy organizing training for the Austro-Hungarians they now commanded, whom the Russians were still pushing back.\n\n===Chief of the staff in the east===\n\nThe crisis worsened when [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] entered the war on the side of the Entente. Hindenburg and Ludendorff became the Supreme Commanders. Field Marshal [[Prince Leopold of Bavaria]], whom Hoffmann regarded as \"a clever soldier and a distinguished superior officer\",<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 157.</ref> took command of three army groups that included both German and Austro-Hungarian troops and Hoffmann was elated to become his chief of staff with promotion to major general: \"I shall actually become an Excellenz!\".<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, '''1''', p. 146.</ref> He was supported by a highly competent staff.<ref>Trumpener, 2008, pp. 125-126.</ref>  Eventually they commanded all of the forces of the [[Central Powers]] on the Eastern front: German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Bulgarian. Since he was no longer able to visit the front in person, he was assigned a General Staff officer, Major Wachenfeld, for this purpose.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 162.</ref> The Russians shifted their attacks to the south to support the [[Romania during World War I|Romanians]], who were beaten decisively by an army with troops from all of the Central Powers.  That autumn [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] died. His successor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]], who had been a cavalry officer, appointed himself commander-in-chief and replaced their able chief of staff with \"a more conciliatory personage\",<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 167.</ref> Hoffmann had a two-hour conversation in which the young emperor \"gave his opinion on military matters by which he displayed his great want of understanding in all he said.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 167.</ref>\n\nHe corresponded and met with political leaders: for example Dr. [[Wolfgang Kapp]] a founder of the right wing [[Deutsche Vaterlandspartei|Fatherland Party]] (who after the war led a [[Kapp Putsch|putsch]] that failed to overturn the Republic).<ref>Hoffmann, 1929, p. 166.</ref>\n\n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043c\u04305 (\u0411\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The entrance to the fortress at Brest-Litovsk, headquarters for the Eastern Front and the site of the peace negotiations]]\nWhen 1917 dawned it seemed that as a result of the battering the Russian infantry had suffered when attacking that now most were only willing to defend their positions. Then the [[February Revolution]] led to a new [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian government]] under [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Hoffmann wanted to attack, but was only permitted to use a single division to reduce a Russian [[bridgehead]]. In July Kerensky launched an [[Kerensky Offensive|offensive]] in Galicia, hoping to reinvigorate public support for the war. Hoffmann had anticipated the attack, and was eager to launch their counter-move. At first the Austro-Hungarians lost ground, but on 19 July Prince Leopold and Hoffmann were in a tower watching the Germans counterattack the flank of the Russian incursion, slicing through to the rear.  In a few days the Russians were driven out of Galicia, but further pursuit had to be delayed while railroads were repaired. Hoffmann was rewarded with the Oak Leaves for his ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''. On 1 September they attacked the [[battle of Jugla|Riga fortresses]], by throwing [[pontoon bridge]]s across the intervening river. They took Riga, but most of the defenders had slipped out.\n\nOn 26 November they received a wireless message from the new Russian Bolshevik government requesting an armistice.  They sent a delegation to Hoffmann's headquarters, after dining with them in the mess-room\u2014they included a peasant and a political assassin\u2014he was dismayed that they had been received as representing Russia.<ref>Hoffmann, 1999, p. 212.</ref>  He assisted Foreign Secretary [[Richard von K\u00fchlmann]] during the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ;  his fluent Russian was an asset. Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Ottokar Czernin]] found that \"The General [Hoffmann] combined expert knowledge and energy with a good deal of calm and ability, but also not a little of Prussian brutality....\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Czernin|first1=Count Ottokar|title=In the World War|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.39651|date=1919|publisher=Cassall|location=London|page=219}}</ref>  The negotiations dragged on;  the major sticking point was that the Russians would not be given back Poland, Lithuania, or [[Courland]], which the Central Powers maintained had opted for independence.\n\nIn December 1917 he was summoned to Berlin, where at lunch the Kaiser ordered him, despite his objections, to give his opinion regarding the post-war [[Germany\u2013Poland border|German\u2013Polish border]].  He favored taking from Poland a modest defensive strip, so they would acquire as few new Slav subjects as possible. The Supreme Commanders wanted much of Poland, so they were furious when the kaiser endorsed his viewpoint.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wheeller-Bennett|first1=John|title=Hindenburg.

Hoffmann did not write any clause in the treaty, but Trotsky \"did not doubt for a single minute that ... General Hoffmann was the only element of serious reality in these negotiations.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=From October to Brest-Litovsk|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_uB5YAAAAMAAJ|date=1919|publisher=The Socialist Publication Society|location=Brooklyn NY|page=87}}</ref> The Central Powers simultaneously negotiated with a delegation representing an independent [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukraine]].  In late January 1918 Trotsky returned to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] to consult about the Ukrainian problem.  When he returned a peace with the Ukrainians had been signed.  On 10 February Trotsky announced that Russia would consider the war at an end but would not sign the proposed treaty.  Eight days later the Eastern Army resumed its offensive, sweeping over the remainder of the Baltic provinces without opposition. After two days the Russians caved in: the Treaty was signed on 3 March 1918.  German troops marched into the Ukraine to prop up the beleaguered independent government and also went further east into the [[Don River (Russia)|Don basin]] to obtain the coal to ship the grain they seized.\nHoffmann anticipated that the Crimea would become the German Riviera.<ref>Kitchen, 1976, p. 241.</ref>  The Supreme Commanders set up new administrations for the Ukraine and the Baltic States, strikingly diminishing Prince Leopold's and Hoffmann's territorial sway\u2014they were left only with ''Ober Ost''.

The leader of the new, small [[Reichswehr|German Army]] was [[Hans von Seeckt]], who had quarreled with Hoffmann during the war.  Hoffmann was retired in March 1920.  He settled back in Berlin where he reconciled with Hindenburg at a personal meeting.  He and the industrialist Arnold Rechberg campaigned persistently trying to persuade the western powers to join together to overthrow the [[Soviet Union]].  He published his wartime memoirs and evaluations,<ref>Hoffmann, 1999.</ref> his views on Russia,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Max|title=An allen enden Moskau.

It is situated on the banks of the river Mahatmain ( principal branch of river Falgu before disappearing in 'Taal' area of [[Mokama]]). This village consists of six settlements (or tolas in local parlance) viz Gauri, [[Gyaspur]] (near [[Varuna]] village), Abdalchak (near Shivchak village) and three settlements of Pundah (consisting two tolas - Deeh and [[Narayanpur, Assam|Narayanpur]] besides a tola called 'Tari Par' near Mahatmain river basin). Gauri Pundah thus is the largest village in the surrounding region. It has a population of more than two thousands and a half.\n\n==History and culture==\n\nHistory and culture of Gauri Pundah village is very rich. The first part of the name of this village reflects the name of the mother goddess Gauri, the consort of Lord Shiva, whereas the second part Pundah has a famous rural temple known as Mahadeo Sthan, dedicated entirely to the worship of [[Shiva]]. This temple is so famous in the region that people from the nearby villages throng to it to offer prayers to Lord Shiva particularly on the occasion of [[Mahashivratri]] and Shravan Masa as per Vikram Calendar. Nearby located are [[Saptamatrika]] (seven mother goddesses, consorts of various Hindu gods) temple and Mahavir Sthan (temple dedicated to Lord Hanumana). Traits of a typical [[Magadhan]] culture are seen aplenty in this village.\n\n==Geography==\n\nGauri Pundah is situated on the banks of the river Mahatmain ( principal branch of river [[Falgu]] before disappearing in 'Taal' area of [[Mokama]]). It is also connected to river [[Dhoba]] (another branch of river Falgu) through a traditional aquatic channel. This village consists of five settlements (or tolas in local parlance) viz Gauri, Gyaspur (near Varuna village), Abdalchak (near Shivchak village) and three settlements of Pundah (consisting two tolas - Deeh and Narayanpur besides a tola called 'Tari Par' near Mahatmain river basin). Gauri Pundah thus is the largest village in the surrounding region. It has a population of more than two thousands and half.\n\n==Economy==\n\nGauri Pundah is an [[agrarian economy]]. Main crops include all types of cereals, vegetable, pulses, etc. The village is dependent on local markets of Fatuha and Daniyawan for commercial activities.\n\n==Demographics==\n\nGauri Pundah consists of a large number of agricultural communities and labourers. Backward and Dalit communities form more than 98% of the population. Amongst the Dalits, extremely downtrodden communities, which are also known as Mahadalits, are prevalent here, mainly in form of Musahar. \"Musahar\" word came from a Sanskrit word Mushahara (meaning rat-eaters). These people used to provide maximum benefit to the farmers by eating the rodents which were hugely detrimental to the crops and by making themselves available as agricultural labour. Amongst farming communities, Kurmis and Yadavas are dominant as also is the overall case in the state of Bihar. The main beneficiary of the traditional social structure nowadays are these sections of backward communities in addition to the upper castes, which include only Brahmins, being the most regular beneficiary of the system who enjoyed traditional advantage in the feudalistic caste-ridden Indian society. Still, a vast majority of the people are yet to get any benefits arising due to modern development as they have been traditionally kept in such darkness by the higher communities who never cared to uplift them. Many extremely backward castes, Dalit and Mahadalit communities are landless, only supplying agricultural and other manual labour to the village. Their condition is very miserable and they lack all the basic amenities of the life. It is happening due to still prevailing feudal nature of the rural society here. They are yet to be liberated from the vicious cycle of abject poverty. Literacy level is below 80%, particularly low amongst women and dalit communities.\n\nThere has been some advancement in the village. But, its fruits have all been cornered by the higher sections of the society leaving the landless to suffer in eternity.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\nThe village now is ready to witness the taste of Bihar's growth story. Gauri Pundah is selected under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) to ensure rural electrification of this village. Ironically, the village was electrified till 1980. After that, it got de-electrified. However efforts are on to provide better facilities to the villagers and steps has been taken to take the voice to the higher authority. The village have a primary school and a middle school is going to open very soon. Villages have to go to Balwa village to study high school courses. Beyond [[matriculation]], villagers go to Fatuha or nearby towns like Bakhtiarpur or Patna the capital city of Bihar.\nGauri Pundah is proposed to be connected through roads to Daniawan and Fatuha markets via Nimi and Suranga Par villages respectively. The work is under progress on these two roads.
