The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref name=\"Fraser102\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=102}}</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Fraser72\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=72}}</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref name=\"Fraser79\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=79}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref name=\"Fraser80\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=80-81}}</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref name=\"Fraser80\"/>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the ''Barfleur'' and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref name\"Stevens173\">Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.<ref name=\"Stevens173\">{{Harvnb|Allen|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=\"Fraser86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=86-89}}</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref name=\"Fraser111\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=111}}</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref name=\"Fraser90\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=90-92}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref name=\"Fraser103\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=103-05}}</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''.

At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref name=\"Fraser107\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref name=\"Fraser110\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=110-11}}</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref name=\"Fraser110\"/>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref name=\"Fraser113\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=113}}</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref name=\"Fraser117\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=117-19}}</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref name=\"Fraser117\"/>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref name=\"Fraser123\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=123}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref name=\"Fraser126\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=126}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref name=\"Fraser122\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=122}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref name=\"Fraser130\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=130-33}}</ref>\n \nThe ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\n===French flight===\n[[File:The Battle of the Saints, 12 April 1782 RMG BHC0444.tiff|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes April 1782'' by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref name=\"Fraser137\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=137-38}}</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref name=\"Fraser137\"/>\n\nAfter an afternoon of sporadic outbursts between British and French around 4pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the Ville de Pais, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] became the third French ship to surrender, having been flanked by HMS Canada and HMS Alcide. Following the mortal wounding of the captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the Alcide.<ref name=\"Fraser140\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=140}}</ref>\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5486.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the battle by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nNext to surrender was [[French ship Ardent (1764)|Ardent]] who was flanked by HMS Belliqueux and HMS Prince William. With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref>\n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and Formidable close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were Triumphante (Vaudreuil's flagship), Bourgogne (under De La Charette), Magnifique (under Macarty Macteigne), Pluton (under De Rion) and Marseillais (under De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from De Grasse's squadron also still remained: Languedoc, Couronne and Sceptre.<ref name=\"Fraser143\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=143-44}}</ref>\n\nDe Grasse's closest protector the Couronne, moved away at the approach of HMS Canada, which began the final attack on the Ville de Paris.\n\nWith little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.\n\n[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, had ordered eight ships of his own division<ref name=\"Trew\"/> to aid Ville de Paris but only the Ardent had proceeded and its isolation had caused its capture.<ref name=\"Fraser143\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nHMS Canada swept passed the Ville de Paris doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. [[HMS Russell]] under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside which ripped the entire length of the ship. The Russell then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship's retreat, whilst HMS Barfleur moved onto the opposite side. The Languedoc attempted to approach to give aid but was beaten back by HMS Duke.<ref name=\"Fraser148\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=146-48}}</ref>\n\nThe Ville de Paris was in desperate condition with all masts damaged and the rudder shot away. At least 300 men were dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6pm, being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, the Ville de Paris eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood approached on the Barfleur, which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender. In an ungentlemanly act Hood ordered one final broadside at close quarters, when de Grasse had already indicated surrender.<ref name=\"Fraser148\"/>\n\nThe boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror. The numbers killed were so great that the surviving, either from want of leisure, or through dismay, had not thrown the bodies of the killed overboard, so that the decks were covered with the blood and mangled limbs of the dead, as well as the wounded and dying\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Donald|title=Admiral Rodney|date=1962|publisher=Norton|page=239}}</ref>}} Remarkably Admiral de Grasse appeared not to have a scratch on him, whilst every one of his officers had either been killed or wounded. Only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, seeing Grasse's fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney signalled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was therefore over.<ref name=\"Fraser152\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=152}}</ref>\n\nLater that night, around 9pm, a fire begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, breaking into the liquor store.

The total French casualties were severe, around 15,000 killed wounded or captured, and six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 dead and around 4000 wounded. More than 8,000 French were captured, 2000 of these being soldiers.

The campaign to capture Jamaica was abandoned.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.158</ref>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line.

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref name=\"Fraser102\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=102}}</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Fraser72\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=72}}</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref name=\"Fraser79\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=79}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref name=\"Fraser80\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=80-81}}</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref name=\"Fraser80\"/>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the ''Barfleur'' and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref name\"Stevens173\">Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.<ref name=\"Stevens173\">{{Harvnb|Allen|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=\"Fraser86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=86-89}}</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref name=\"Fraser111\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=111}}</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref name=\"Fraser90\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=90-92}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref name=\"Fraser103\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=103-05}}</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref name=\"Fraser107\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref name=\"Fraser110\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=110-11}}</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref name=\"Fraser110\"/>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref name=\"Fraser113\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=113}}</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref name=\"Fraser117\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=117-19}}</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref name=\"Fraser117\"/>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref name=\"Fraser123\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=123}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref name=\"Fraser126\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=126}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref name=\"Fraser122\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=122}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref name=\"Fraser130\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=130-33}}</ref>\n \nThe ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\n===French flight===\n[[File:The Battle of the Saints, 12 April 1782 RMG BHC0444.tiff|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes April 1782'' by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref name=\"Fraser137\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=137-38}}</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref name=\"Fraser137\"/>\n\nAfter an afternoon of sporadic outbursts between British and French around 4pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the Ville de Pais, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] became the third French ship to surrender, having been flanked by HMS Canada and HMS Alcide. Following the mortal wounding of the captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the Alcide.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.140</ref><ref name=\"Fraser140\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=140}}</ref>\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5486.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the battle by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nNext to surrender was [[French ship Ardent (1764)|Ardent]] who was flanked by HMS Belliqueux and HMS Prince William.\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref>\n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and Formidable close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were Triumphante (Vaudreuil's flagship), Bourgogne (under De La Charette), Magnifique (under Macarty Macteigne), Pluton (under De Rion) and Marseillais (under De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from De Grasse's squadron also still remained: Languedoc, Couronne and Sceptre.<ref name=\"Fraser143\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=143-44}}</ref>\n\nDe Grasse's closest protector the Couronne, moved away at the approach of HMS Canada, which began the final attack on the Ville de Paris.\n\nWith little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.\n\n[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, had ordered eight ships of his own division<ref name=\"Trew\"/> to aid Ville de Paris but only the Ardent had proceeded and its isolation had caused its capture.<ref name=\"Fraser143\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nHMS Canada swept passed the Ville de Paris doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. [[HMS Russell]] under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside which ripped the entire length of the ship. The Russell then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship's retreat, whilst HMS Barfleur moved onto the opposite side. The Languedoc attempted to approach to give aid but was beaten back by HMS Duke.<ref name=\"Fraser148\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=146-48}}</ref>\n\nThe Ville de Paris was in desperate condition with all masts damaged and the rudder shot away. At least 300 men were dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6pm, being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, the Ville de Paris eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood approached on the Barfleur, which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender. In an ungentlemanly act Hood ordered one final broadside at close quarters, when de Grasse had already indicated surrender.<ref name=\"Fraser148\"/>\n\nThe boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror. The numbers killed were so great that the surviving, either from want of leisure, or through dismay, had not thrown the bodies of the killed overboard, so that the decks were covered with the blood and mangled limbs of the dead, as well as the wounded and dying\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Donald|title=Admiral Rodney|date=1962|publisher=Norton|page=239}}</ref>}} Remarkably Admiral de Grasse appeared not to have a scratch on him, whilst every one of his officers had either been killed or wounded. Only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, seeing Grasse's fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney signalled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was therefore over.<ref name=\"Fraser152\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=152}}</ref>\n\nLater that night, around 9pm, a fire begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, breaking into the liquor store. By 10.30pm, and now out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 58 British sailors, plus the lieutenant in charge, all from HMS Centaur, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> Those jumping overboard met a more horrible fate, due to the sharks below. The French captain, De Marigny, who was confined to his cabin, was one of the many killed. None of the British prize crew survived.<ref name=\"Fraser155\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=155}}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"230px\">\nFile:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse(crop).jpg|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.\nFile:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]\nFile:French Captive Ships 12 April 1782.jpg|Captive French ships after the battle by [[Dominic Serres]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe damaged British fleet sailed with Rodney to [[Port Royal, Jamaica]] arriving on 29 April. It took nine weeks to repair the fleet.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Frasrer, 1904, p.163</ref>\n\nThe British lost 337 killed and 766 wounded<ref>Admiralty records 1782</ref>, and three captains out of the 36 also died. The total French casualties were severe, around 15,000 killed wounded or captured, and six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 dead and around 4000 wounded. More than 8,000 French were captured, 2000 of these being soldiers. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nThe monetary loss to the French was at least \u00a3500,000. The campaign to capture Jamaica was abandoned.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.158</ref>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

She continued to represent Luxembourg in the early part of her career, and in 1990 became the first female player from her country to reach the third round of a Grand Slam, a feat that she achieved at [[1990 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], before she lost to [[Martina Navratilova]].\n\nIn 1991, she reached the third round of the [[1991 Australian Open|Australian Open]], a result that broke her into the top 100, and finished the year at No. 88, but soon left in early 1992 after a lengthy break with injury. She came back stronger and managed to finish 1992 as the No. 78 in the world.\n\nKschwendt began to achieve solid results in 1993; now playing for Germany, she reached the semifinals of Auckland, the quarterfinals of Paris, and made her first and only WTA Tour final at an event in Belgium (she lost to [[Radka Bobkov\u00e1]]).

She continued to represent Luxembourg in the early part of her career, and in 1990 became the first female player from her country to reach the third round of a Grand Slam, a feat that she achieved at [[1990 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], before she lost to [[Martina Navratilova]].\n\nIn 1991, she reached the third round of the [[1991 Australian Open|Australian Open]], a result that broke her into the top 100, and finished the year at No. 88, but soon left in early 1992 after a lengthy break with injury. She came back stronger and managed to finish 1992 as the No. 78 in the world.\n\nKschwendt began to achieve solid results in 1993; now playing for Germany, she reached the semifinals of Auckland, the quarterfinals of Paris, and made her first and only WTA Tour final at an event in Belgium (she lost to [[Radka Bobkov\u00e1]]). The following year, she reached the third round of a major once more, this time at the [[French Open]], but fell to [[Iva Majoli]].\n\n1996 saw Kschwendt put together her best season, reaching the third round of the [[1996 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and achieving consistent results in WTA Tour events. She finished that year at No. 47, but went as high as No. 37 in August.\n\nIn 1997, she played her only match for the [[Austria Fed Cup team]], losing her doubles match against [[Croatia Fed Cup team|Croatia]].\n\nHer last few years on Tour were mostly spent playing on the [[ITF Women's Circuit]] and qualifications of WTA events.

It is located to the west of [[Rajajinagar]] and is sandwiched between the localities of [[Mahalakshmi Layout]] to the north and [[Vijayanagar, Bangalore|Vijayanagar]] to the south, spread across multiple sub-localities, three assembly constituencies and seven [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike]] (BBMP) wards. The area of Basaveshwaranagar is often considered as ''West of Chord Road'' as it lies to the west of Chord Road, an arterial road in the western part of Bangalore.\n\n==Etymology==\nBasaveshwaranagar is named after [[Basavanna]] (also known as Basaveshwara), a social reformer whose followers comprise the [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] community.<ref>[http://salimathss.blogspot.com/2012/11/life-history-of-basavanna.html life history of Basavanna]</ref>\n\n==History==\nBasaveshwaranagar was formed as an extension by the City Improvement Trust Board (currently the [[Bangalore Development Authority]]) in stages between the late 1960s and early 1980s. At that time (even now unofficially), the area was known as ''West of Chord Road'' (WCR), as it lay to the west of the Chord Road which at the time was considered as the western end of the city.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/105676/10/10_chapter%203.pdf Chapter: 3 PLANNING BANGALORE CITY: ITS EXPANSION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT]</ref> There were also many private layouts in the area formed in the 1970s by public and private sector organisations for their employees such as [[Life Insurance Corporation of India|LIC]], [[Kirloskar Group]], [[State Bank of India|SBI]] and [[Bharat Earth Movers Limited|BEML]] among others. The close proximity of Basaveshwaranagar to the [[Bangalore City railway station]], [[Kempegowda Bus Station]], the [[Bengaluru Pete]], residential-cum-commercial localities like [[Rajajinagar]] and [[Malleswaram]] and the [[Peenya]] industrial area helped its growth. Today, Basaveshwaranagar is an important residential and commercial hub in West Bangalore. But since Basaveshwaranagar is very far away from the IT Corridor (a large area in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Bangalore city with [[Information Technology|IT]] and software parks and [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]]s), large-scale development in the area has been minimal and Basaveshwaranagar is today considered as one of the greenest and more conservative localities of Bangalore city.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Kspcb sanegurvanahalli.png|thumb|300px|left|Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Saneguruvanahalli]]\nBasaveshwaranagar is situated in the western part of Bangalore, about 914 metres above sea level,<ref name=\"bsvnagar coords\">[https://www.latlong.net/place/basaveshwara-nagar-bengaluru-karnataka-india-10164.html Basaveshwara Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India]</ref> at 12\u00b098' N and 77\u00b053' E.<ref name=\"bsvnagar coords\"/> Nearby areas include [[Rajajinagar]], [[Mahalakshmi Layout]], [[Nandini Layout]], Laggere, Sunkadakatte and [[Vijayanagar, Bangalore|Vijayanagar]].\n\nThe terrain of Basaveshwaranagar is quite hilly and uneven.

It is located to the west of [[Rajajinagar]] and is sandwiched between the localities of [[Mahalakshmi Layout]] to the north and [[Vijayanagar, Bangalore|Vijayanagar]] to the south, spread across multiple sub-localities, three assembly constituencies and seven [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike]] (BBMP) wards. The area of Basaveshwaranagar is often considered as ''West of Chord Road'' as it lies to the west of Chord Road, an arterial road in the western part of Bangalore.\n\n==Etymology==\nBasaveshwaranagar is named after [[Basavanna]] (also known as Basaveshwara), a social reformer whose followers comprise the [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] community.<ref>[http://salimathss.blogspot.com/2012/11/life-history-of-basavanna.html life history of Basavanna]</ref>\n\n==History==\nBasaveshwaranagar was formed as an extension by the City Improvement Trust Board (currently the [[Bangalore Development Authority]]) in stages between the late 1960s and early 1980s. At that time (even now unofficially), the area was known as ''West of Chord Road'' (WCR), as it lay to the west of the Chord Road which at the time was considered as the western end of the city.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/105676/10/10_chapter%203.pdf Chapter: 3 PLANNING BANGALORE CITY: ITS EXPANSION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT]</ref> There were also many private layouts in the area formed in the 1970s by public and private sector organisations for their employees such as [[Life Insurance Corporation of India|LIC]], [[Kirloskar Group]], [[State Bank of India|SBI]] and [[Bharat Earth Movers Limited|BEML]] among others. The close proximity of Basaveshwaranagar to the [[Bangalore City railway station]], [[Kempegowda Bus Station]], the [[Bengaluru Pete]], residential-cum-commercial localities like [[Rajajinagar]] and [[Malleswaram]] and the [[Peenya]] industrial area helped its growth. Today, Basaveshwaranagar is an important residential and commercial hub in West Bangalore. But since Basaveshwaranagar is very far away from the IT Corridor (a large area in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Bangalore city with [[Information Technology|IT]] and software parks and [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]]s), large-scale development in the area has been minimal and Basaveshwaranagar is today considered as one of the greenest and more conservative localities of Bangalore city.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Kspcb sanegurvanahalli.png|thumb|300px|left|Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, Saneguruvanahalli]]\nBasaveshwaranagar is situated in the western part of Bangalore, about 914 metres above sea level,<ref name=\"bsvnagar coords\">[https://www.latlong.net/place/basaveshwara-nagar-bengaluru-karnataka-india-10164.html Basaveshwara Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India]</ref> at 12\u00b098' N and 77\u00b053' E.<ref name=\"bsvnagar coords\"/> Nearby areas include [[Rajajinagar]], [[Mahalakshmi Layout]], [[Nandini Layout]], Laggere, Sunkadakatte and [[Vijayanagar, Bangalore|Vijayanagar]].\n\nThe terrain of Basaveshwaranagar is quite hilly and uneven. The area is known for its steep and hilly roads which rise high and low. The area was also known for lakes such as the Agrahara Dasarahalli Lake, Kurubarahalli Lake and Saneguruvahalli Lake among others. All the lakes have dried up in recent time and residential layouts or parks have been built over them.\n\nBasaveshwaranagar is considered to be the least polluted locality in Bangalore city, with real-time air quality level coming well within Good levels of 0-50 most of the time.<ref>[https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi Air Quality Index (AQI) Basics]</ref> There is an air quality monitoring station at Saneguruvanahalli maintained by the [[Karnataka State Pollution Control Board]] (KSPCB).<ref>[https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/civic/articleshow/50685837.cms Silk Board Jn, Whitefield most polluted places in Bengaluru]</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Bangalore including Basaveshwaranagar itself experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'').

[[Sharon Stone]] was cast to portray Geri McGee and was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for Best Lead Actress for her performance.\n\nThe script made many changes to McGee's story. In the film, the Rosenthals only have one daughter, Amy, and in real life, McGee had three children. The script changed the couple's names from Geri McGee and Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal to Ginger McKenna (played by {[Sharon Stone]]) and Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (played by [[Robert De Niro]]), and Lenny Marmor to Lester Diamond (played by [[James Woods]])\n .<ref>{{cite book|title=The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert Deniro|isbn=978-0810874138}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Pileggi, Nicholas|title=Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas|isbn=0-684-80832-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/casinolovehonori00pile}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Find a Grave|18376|Geri McGee Rosenthal}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGee, Geri}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:1982 deaths]]\n[[Category:Accidental deaths in California]]\n[[Category:Alcohol-related deaths in California]]\n[[Category:American female models]]\n[[Category:American showgirls]]\n[[Category:Burials at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Cocaine-related deaths in California]]\n[[Category:Drug-related deaths in California]]\n[[Category:Female models from California]]\n[[Category:Van Nuys High School alumni]]\n", "name_user": "GeneralGCuster", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCasino", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri_McGee"}
