He was also the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nominee of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], running unsuccessfully alongside [[Mitt Romney]].\n\nRyan, a native of [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], graduated from [[Miami University]] in 1992. He spent five years working for Republicans in Washington, D.C. and returned to Wisconsin in 1997 to work at his family's construction company. Ryan was elected to Congress to represent {{ushr|WI|1}} the following year, replacing an incumbent Republican who ran for U.S. Senate. Ryan would represent the district for 20 years. He chaired the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] from 2011 to 2015 and briefly chaired the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] in 2015 prior to [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October 2015|being elected]] Speaker of the House in October 2015 following [[John Boehner]]'s retirement.\n\nA self-proclaimed deficit hawk, Ryan was a major proponent of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] privatization in the mid-2000s. In the 2010s, two proposals heavily influenced by Ryan\u2014\"[[The Path to Prosperity]]\" and \"[[A Better Way]]\"\u2014advocated for the privatization of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], the conversion of [[Medicaid (United States)|Medicaid]] into a [[block grant]] program, the repeal of the [[Affordable Care Act]], and significant federal tax cuts. As Speaker, he had a role in passage of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. His other major piece of legislation, the [[American Health Care Act of 2017]], passed the House but failed in the Senate by one vote.

January 29, 1970) is an American retired politician who served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives|54th]] [[speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from October 2015 to January 2019. He was also the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] nominee of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], running unsuccessfully alongside [[Mitt Romney]].\n\nRyan, a native of [[Janesville, Wisconsin]], graduated from [[Miami University]] in 1992. He spent five years working for Republicans in Washington, D.C. and returned to Wisconsin in 1997 to work at his family's construction company. Ryan was elected to Congress to represent {{ushr|WI|1}} the following year, replacing an incumbent Republican who ran for U.S. Senate. Ryan would represent the district for 20 years. He chaired the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] from 2011 to 2015 and briefly chaired the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] in 2015 prior to [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October 2015|being elected]] Speaker of the House in October 2015 following [[John Boehner]]'s retirement.\n\nA self-proclaimed deficit hawk, Ryan was a major proponent of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] privatization in the mid-2000s. In the 2010s, two proposals heavily influenced by Ryan\u2014\"[[The Path to Prosperity]]\" and \"[[A Better Way]]\"\u2014advocated for the privatization of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], the conversion of [[Medicaid (United States)|Medicaid]] into a [[block grant]] program, the repeal of the [[Affordable Care Act]], and significant federal tax cuts. As Speaker, he had a role in passage of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. His other major piece of legislation, the [[American Health Care Act of 2017]], passed the House but failed in the Senate by one vote. Ryan's tenure as Speaker of the House\u2014most of which coincided with a period of unified Republican control of the federal government\u2014saw a significant increase in federal government spending and deficits.\n\nRyan declined to run for re-election in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm elections]].

It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref> The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the [[Great Northern War]], they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents.<ref name = \"Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164\"> Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164</ref>    \n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Battle of Seringapatam#Siege|Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[Marine salvage|salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf.<ref name = \"Rodger, 128\u2013130\"> Rodger (1986) 128\u2013130</ref> Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew. It was common practice to divide this into shares, with the officers receiving several times as much as seamen, their relative shares being agreed at the start of the voyage.<ref name = \"Rodger, 97, 312\"> Rodger (1986) 97, 312</ref>\n\n===Notable awards, 1707 to 1801=== \nPerhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded for the capture of a single ship was for that of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']] on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate {{HMS|Active|1758|2}} and sloop {{HMS|Favourite|1757|2}}. The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482 to 485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

As a result of the [[Siege of Havana]], which led to the surrender of that city on August 1762, 10 Spanish [[ships-of-the-line]], three [[frigates]] and a number of smaller vessels were captured, together with large quantities of military equipment, cash and merchandise. Prize money payments of \u00a3122,697 each were made to the naval commander, Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], and the military commander, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel| Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref name = \"Rodger, 247-248\"> Rodger (1986) 257-258</ref>\n\nThe prize money from [[Action of 16 October 1799|the capture of the Spanish frigates ''Thetis'' and ''Santa Brigada'']] in October 1799, \u00a3652,000, was split up among the crews of four British frigates, with each captain being awarded \u00a340,730 and the Seamen each receiving \u00a3182 4s 9\u00bed or the equivalent of 10 years' pay.<ref name = \"Rodger, 524\"> Rodger (2005) 524</ref>\n\n==[[United Kingdom]] from 1801==\nAfter the [[Act of Union 1801]] between Great Britain and Ireland, the former prize money rules of Great Britain applied to the United Kingdom. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger, 522\u2013524\">Rodger (205) 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice-Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values.<ref name = \"Rodger, 317-318\"> Rodger (1986) 317-318</ref>This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 10, 237\"> Murdoch 10 237</ref> In 1652, the [[Royal Scots Navy| Scottish fleet]] that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 230, 236\"> Murdoch 230 236</ref>\n\nHowever, as Scotland was involved in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665\u201367) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672\u201374) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers after 1665 by issuing  [[Letters of marque]]. <ref name = \"Murdoch, 27, 238-240\"> Murdoch 27, 238-240</ref> At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 240-241\"> Murdoch 240-241</ref> Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned.

A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (''Conseil des Prises''), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny.<ref name = \" Cormack, 76\"> Cormack 76</ref> Cormack (2002), p.76.

Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet.<ref name = \"Symcox, 3-5\"> Symcox 3-5</ref> Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 108, 342\"> Jenkins 108, 342</ref>\n\nWhen a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one-fifth of the value of all captures.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 100-102\"> Jenkins 100-102</ref> Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]].

In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 155-156\"> Lunsford, 155-156</ref> Privateers licenced by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed ''interlopers'' in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. .<ref name = \"Lunsford, 183-184\"> Lunsford 183-184</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]], the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Privateers licenced by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. <ref name = \"Klooster, 43-44\"> Klooster 43-44</ref> The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 [[Treaty of The Hague (1661)|Treaty of The Hague]], but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 145\"> Bruijn (2011) 145</ref>. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 56\"> Bruijn (2008) 56</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===To 1814===\nDuring the Revolutionary War period, the [[Continental Congress]] had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]] granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] that [[Confederate privateer]]s would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encoraged their owners to turn to [[Blockade runner| Blockade running]].<ref name = \"Peifer, 98-99\"> Peifer 98-99</ref> \n\nFrom 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref> The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the [[Great Northern War]], they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents.<ref name = \"Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164\"> Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164</ref>    \n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf.<ref name = \"Rodger, 128\u2013130\"> Rodger (1986) 128\u2013130</ref> Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew.

The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482 to 485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

As a result of the [[Siege of Havana]], which led to the surrender of that city on August 1762, 10 Spanish [[ships-of-the-line]], three [[frigates]] and a number of smaller vessels were captured, together with large quantities of military equipment, cash and merchandise. Prize money payments of \u00a3122,697 each were made to the naval commander, Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], and the military commander, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel| Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref name = \"Rodger, 247-248\"> Rodger (1986) 257-258</ref>\n\nThe prize money from [[Action of 16 October 1799|the capture of the Spanish frigates ''Thetis'' and ''Santa Brigada'']] in October 1799, \u00a3652,000, was split up among the crews of four British frigates, with each captain being awarded \u00a340,730 and the Seamen each receiving \u00a3182 4s 9\u00bed or the equivalent of 10 years' pay.<ref name = \"Rodger, 524\"> Rodger (2005) 524</ref>\n\n==[[United Kingdom]] from 1801==\nAfter the [[Act of Union 1801]] between Great Britain and Ireland, the former prize money rules of Great Britain applied to the United Kingdom. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger, 522\u2013524\">Rodger (205) 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice-Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values.<ref name = \"Rodger, 317-318\"> Rodger (1986) 317-318</ref>This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 10, 237\"> Murdoch 10 237</ref> In 1652, the [[Royal Scots Navy| Scottish fleet]] that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 230, 236\"> Murdoch 230 236</ref>\n\nHowever, as Scotland was involved in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665\u201367) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672\u201374) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers after 1665 by issuing  [[Letters of marque]]. <ref name = \"Murdoch, 27, 238-240\"> Murdoch 27, 238-240</ref> At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 240-241\"> Murdoch 240-241</ref> Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned. Most of these engaged in Atlantic trade had to sail around the north of Scotland to avoid the English Channel in wartime, and the Dutch whaling and herring fleets operated in waters north and east of Scotland, so they were vulnerable Scottish privateers, who were particularly successful in the Second Anglo-Dutch War.<ref name = \"Graham, 69-70\"> Graham 69-70</ref> The owners of privateering vessels, were entitled to the greater part of the value of their prizes, as their ordinary seamen usually served for wages rather than a share of prize money.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 177\"> Murdoch 177</ref> \n\n===Ireland===\nAdmirals of Ireland were appointed in the later middle ages and from the late 16th century, these admirals became the Irish representatives of the Lord Admiral of England, and were sometimes referred to as the Vice-Admiral of Ireland, but had no control over the royal fleet in Irish waters. Ireland also had its own Admiralty Court, mainly staffed by English admiralty officials and with a jurisdiction was broadly similar to that of its English counterpart.<ref name = \"Appleby & O'Dowd, 229-300\"> Appleby & O'Dowd 229-300</ref> Much of its activities concerned the many pirates operating off the coast of Ireland during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (''Conseil des Prises''), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny.<ref name = \" Cormack, 76\"> Cormack 76</ref> Cormack (2002), p.76. The Prize Council only functioned in times of war until 1861: it then became permanent until its dissolution in 1965.<ref>Archives du Conseil des Prises 1854 to 1965//https://francearchives.fr/fr/findingaid/f0164f7014d16d2cb68bc56607a6700eebf6c874</ref>\n\nAlthough officers and men of the French Navy were, in principle, entitled to prize money, and depriving men of prize money due to them was an established disciplinary measure, awards were relatively rare.<ref name = \"Cormack, 27\"> Cormack 27</ref> During the 17th and 18th centuries, French naval strategy alternated between that of ''Guerre d\u2019Escadre'', maintaining a fully-equipped battle fleet for control of the sea, and ''Guerre de Course'', sometimes using naval ships but more often privateers, including smaller naval warships leased to private individuals, to destroy an enemy\u2019s maritime commerce. Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet.<ref name = \"Symcox, 3-5\"> Symcox 3-5</ref> Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 108, 342\"> Jenkins 108, 342</ref>\n\nWhen a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one-fifth of the value of all captures.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 100-102\"> Jenkins 100-102</ref> Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]].

Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]] granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] that [[Confederate privateer]]s would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encoraged their owners to turn to [[Blockade runner| Blockade running]].<ref name = \"Peifer, 98-99\"> Peifer 98-99</ref> \n\nFrom 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

In the run-up to World War II, he worked on a draft of a papal encyclical against racist and totalitarian ideologies for [[Pope Pius XI]]; entitled ''[[Humani generis unitas]]'', though it was never promulgated due to the death of Pius XI on February 10, 1939.\n\n==Early life and education==\nJohn LaFarge was born on February 13, 1880, in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the youngest son of the artist [[John La Farge]] (1835\u20131910), who was a descendant of French refugees, and his mother Margaret Mason Perry La Farge was a granddaughter of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and a great-great-granddaughter of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. His siblings included Christopher Grant (who became an architect and partner in the firm of [[Heins & LaFarge]]), Emily Marie, John Louis Bancel, Margaret Angela, Oliver Hazard Perry (who also became an architect), Frances, and Joseph Raymond (who did not survive infancy).\n\nLaFarge was gifted at music and languages, eventually becoming fluent in both French and German. At the age of 10, he edited ''The Sunlight'', a monthly magazine put out by a group of his friends, one of whom had access to a hand printing press. LaFarge wrote a serialized science fiction story for the magazine under the title \"Trip to Mars\".<ref name=laf/>{{rp|44}} As a child he met a number of notable friends of the family, including [[Henry Adams]], [[Edith Wharton]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William James|William]] and [[Henry James]]; he later became friendly at college with William and Henry's younger brother Robertson James.<ref name=laf/>{{rp|71}}\n\nIn 1897 he entered [[Harvard University]], from which he graduated with the class of 1901. During his studies he focused mainly on classical Latin and Greek. He also published several articles in ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''.\n\n==Priesthood==\nLaFarge was drawn to the priesthood early, though he also considered careers in the navy or the professoriate.<ref name=laf/>{{rp|52}} In the fall of 1901, he went to Austria to study theology at the [[University of Innsbruck]]. On 26 July 26, 1905, he was ordained a priest in Innsbruck and joined the [[Society of Jesus]] (commonly known as the Jesuits).

Entitled ''[[Humani generis unitas]]'' ('On The Unity of the Human Race') from its first three words, it was drafted during the summer of 1938 and given to Pius XI near the end of the year. It encompassed a general critique of modern ideas such as the state and race that have diminished human dignity and argued against the moral evils of racism and anti-semitism. It was not promulgated, however, because Pius XI died in early 1939, and his successor, [[Pope Pius XII]], held it back, only taking a few extracts for use in some later encyclicals. For several decades it lingered in the obscurity of the Vatican Archives until the researches of Georges Passelecq and Bernard Suchecky brought the story to light in the 1990s.<ref name=gp/>\n\nIn June 1934, LaFarge founded the Catholic Interracial Council of New York to combat racism; these councils proliferated across America over the next two decades, and in 1959 they merged to become the National Catholic Conference on Interracial Justice. As LaFarge's reputation grew, he was given other visible and important offices. At various times he was chaplain of the Society of the Catholic Laity, an officer of the Catholic Association for International Peace, vice-president of the American Catholic Historical Association, and chaplain of the Liturgical Society of Arts.\n\nIn 1947, LaFarge was invited to give the prestigious [[Dudleian lectures|Dudleian Lecture]] at Harvard; he chose for his topic \"juridic wholeness,\" arguing that human rights must apply universally and not just to select groups.<ref name=laf/>{{rp|319\u201320}}\n\nLaFarge's role as a champion of racial justice was sometimes marred by paternalistic attitudes and (in some people's eyes) by his anti-Communism. He did not play a major role in the civil rights movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s, in part because he was well into his 70s by then. However, just three months before his death, LaFarge walked in the 1963 [[March on Washington]] and stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial behind [[Martin Luther King]] for his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech, a public acknowledgment of LaFarge's early role in a movement for racial equality that was now being led by others.

In the run-up to World War II, he worked on a draft of a papal encyclical against racist and totalitarian ideologies for [[Pope Pius XI]]; entitled ''[[Humani generis unitas]]'', though it was never promulgated due to the death of Pius XI on February 10, 1939.\n\n==Early life and education==\nJohn LaFarge was born on February 13, 1880, in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the youngest son of the artist [[John La Farge]] (1835\u20131910), who was a descendant of French refugees, and his mother Margaret Mason Perry La Farge was a granddaughter of Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] and a great-great-granddaughter of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. His siblings included Christopher Grant (who became an architect and partner in the firm of [[Heins & LaFarge]]), Emily Marie, John Louis Bancel, Margaret Angela, Oliver Hazard Perry (who also became an architect), Frances, and Joseph Raymond (who did not survive infancy).\n\nLaFarge was gifted at music and languages, eventually becoming fluent in both French and German. At the age of 10, he edited ''The Sunlight'', a monthly magazine put out by a group of his friends, one of whom had access to a hand printing press. LaFarge wrote a serialized science fiction story for the magazine under the title \"Trip to Mars\".<ref name=laf/>{{rp|44}} As a child he met a number of notable friends of the family, including [[Henry Adams]], [[Edith Wharton]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William James|William]] and [[Henry James]]; he later became friendly at college with William and Henry's younger brother Robertson James.<ref name=laf/>{{rp|71}}\n\nIn 1897 he entered [[Harvard University]], from which he graduated with the class of 1901. During his studies he focused mainly on classical Latin and Greek. He also published several articles in ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''.\n\n==Priesthood==\nLaFarge was drawn to the priesthood early, though he also considered careers in the navy or the professoriate.<ref name=laf/>{{rp|52}} In the fall of 1901, he went to Austria to study theology at the [[University of Innsbruck]].

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTwo of the major uprising of kolis placed in the years of 1721 and 1729, the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Second, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier.

There was a war between koli zamidar and faijdar of sultanate. Abdulla Khan commanded the imperial army against kolis with 3000 horses and 12000 foot soldiers to in the battle but koli zamidar didn't declined the battle and there was a blood struggle and victory declared to the Abdulla Khan and the head of koli zamidar lal thakor was hanged at the one of the gate ahmedabad in 1615.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dow|first=Alexander|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dbe7uGnCbT8C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=Abdulla+Khan+1615&source=bl&ots=SHL6fS0fX1&sig=ACfU3U2cmbLrOpY_OczmHfnZHQWwZQkMtg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi05Kfs39_oAhWc73MBHX_GB84Q6AEwD3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=Abdulla%20Khan%201615&f=false|title=The history of Hindustan|last2=Dahiya|first2=B.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne of the major uprising of kolis placed in the year of 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Afterwards, God made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with him and promised never again to destroy all the earth's creatures with a flood.

Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the [[Quran]] ([[Surah]]s [[Sura 71|71]], [[Sura 7|7]], [[Sura 11|1]], and [[Sura 21|21]]).\n\n==Biblical account==\n[[File:Noah mosaic.JPG|thumb|right |12th-century Venetian [[mosaic]] depiction of Noah sending the dove]]\nThe primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\nNoah was the tenth of the Pre-Flood ([[Antediluvian]]) Patriarchs.

Man's life blood would be required from the beasts and from man. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\" (9:6).

Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18\u201327|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\".<ref>Speiser, 1964, 62</ref><ref>T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136</ref> A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah.<ref>Levenson, 2004, 26</ref>\n\n===Table of nations===\n[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]\n{{See also|Generations of Noah}}\n{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood. Among Japheth\u2019s descendants were the maritime nations. (10:2\u20135) Ham\u2019s son [[Biblical Cush|Cush]] had a son named [[Nimrod]], who became the first man of might on earth, a mighty hunter, king in [[Babylon]] and the land of [[Shinar]].

(10:15\u201319) Among Shem\u2019s descendants was [[Eber]]. (10:21)\n\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.<ref>{{citation |last=Bandstra |first=B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=%22table%20of%20nations%22%20noah&f=false |title=Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible |publisher= Cengage Learning |year=2008 |pages= 67\u201368|isbn=978-0495391050 }}</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{AdamtoNoah}}\n\n==Narrative analysis==\nAccording to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the first five books of the Bible ([[Pentateuch]]/[[Torah]]), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood.

Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public.

His story is contained in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[Book of Genesis]], chapters 5\u20139 and in the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Genesis flood narrative]] is among the best-known stories of the [[Bible]]. Noah is also portrayed as \"the first tiller of the soil\" and the inventor of wine.\n\nAccording to the Genesis account, Noah labored faithfully to build the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the [[Great Flood|Flood]]. Afterwards, God made a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with him and promised never again to destroy all the earth's creatures with a flood. The flood narrative is followed by the story of the [[Curse of Ham]].\n\nIn addition to the Book of Genesis, Noah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]], and the books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]], [[Sirach]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[2 Esdras]], [[4 Maccabees]]; in the [[New Testament]], he is mentioned in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[First Epistle of Peter|1st Peter]] and [[Second Epistle of Peter|2nd Peter]]. Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the [[Quran]] ([[Surah]]s [[Sura 71|71]], [[Sura 7|7]], [[Sura 11|1]], and [[Sura 21|21]]).\n\n==Biblical account==\n[[File:Noah mosaic.JPG|thumb|right |12th-century Venetian [[mosaic]] depiction of Noah sending the dove]]\nThe primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\nNoah was the tenth of the Pre-Flood ([[Antediluvian]]) Patriarchs.

They were also told that all fowls, land animals, and fishes would be afraid of them. Furthermore, as well as green plants, every moving thing would be their food with the exception that the blood was not to be eaten. Man's life blood would be required from the beasts and from man. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\" (9:6). A rainbow, called \"my bow\", was given as the sign of a covenant \"between me and you and every living creature that ''[is]'' with you, for perpetual generations\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|9:2\u201317|9}}), called the Noahic covenant or the [[rainbow covenant]].\n\nNoah died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:28\u201329|9}}</ref> the last of the extremely long-lived [[Antediluvian]] patriarchs.

He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent.

Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18\u201327|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\".<ref>Speiser, 1964, 62</ref><ref>T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136</ref> A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah.<ref>Levenson, 2004, 26</ref>\n\n===Table of nations===\n[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]\n{{See also|Generations of Noah}}\n{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah just as he did with Abraham, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.\"{{dead link|date=March 2017}}<ref>[https://http//www.quranbrowser.com/%20%22family 71:26\u201327 Rodwell 1876 version]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop [[Mount Judi]] ({{cite quran|11|44|s=ns}}).\n[[File:Noah's ark and the deluge.JPG|thumb|Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh]]\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.<ref name=Skolnik287 /><ref name = \"Enc Islam\"/>\n\n{{cite quran|29|14|s=ns}} states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\n{{quote|And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods overwhelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing.}}\n\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], which extended until the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/HadhratNuh.pdf | title=Hadhrat Nuh | author=Rashid Ahmad Chaudhry | publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-758-X}}</ref>\n\n===Gnostic===\nAn important Gnostic text, the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'', reports that the chief [[archon (Gnosticism)|archon]] caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon's plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity.

It was officially opened on 13 June 1936 under the name ''Brighton Hove and Worthing Joint Municipal Airport.'' The new terminal building was built in 1936 and was designed by Stavers Tiltman in the [[Art Deco]] style.<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=1409758|mname=|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> The terminal building is still in use and was designated a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1984.\n\nIn 1937 one of the local flying schools received a contract to train pilots for the Royal Air Force and was known as No. 16 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School initially using the [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] which were later supplemented by the use of the [[Hawker Hart]] and [[Hawker Hind|Hind]]. With the start of the Second World War the training school moved away from Shoreham in August 1939.<ref name=\"brooks\">Brooks 1996, pp. 123\u2013130</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nThe airfield started the [[World War II|Second World War]] in civilian hands until a detachment of [[Westland Lysander]]s of [[No. 225 Squadron RAF|225 Squadron]] arrived in July 1940 to undertake coastal patrols.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> With the nearby [[RAF Tangmere]] damaged by air raids the Fighter Interception Unit with the [[Bristol Beaufighter]] moved to Shoreham although they had problems with the grass runway.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> In October 1940 [[No. 422 Flight RAF|422 Flight]] arrived with the [[Hawker Hurricane]] operating as night-fighters. By October 1941 both units had moved away from Shoreham.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\nThe airfield was regularly attacked during July and August 1941 and the next unit to arrive was No 11 Group Target Towing Flight in October 1941.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> Westland Lysanders were used to tow targets for fighter squadrons to practice air-firing.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> Lysanders and later the Supermarine Walrus were also based for search and rescue duties.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> In December 1941 a detachment of [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters from 245 Squadron arrived at Shoreham to support the Tangmere-based squadrons. By August 1941 the fighters had moved on and only the 277 Squadron remained in the search and rescue, the Lysanders were replaced by the [[Boulton Paul Defiant]]s in May 1942.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\nIn February 1943 the Defiants were replaced by [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and in April 1943 the airfield became a practice camp to RAF Regiment gunners in the anti-aircract role.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> Lysanders appeared again but this time to tow targets for the regiment gunners.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> A gunnery training dome was built on the northern perimeter of the airfield that still survives into the 21st Century.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\nIn April 1944 No. 345 (Free French) Squadron arrived with Spitfires to support the preparation for the [[Normandy invasion]]; the squadron was active on [[D-Day]] over the beaches and escorting glider formations.<ref name=\"brooks\" /> No 345 Squadron moved out in August 1944 and 277 Squadron in October 1944 and the airfield went into care and maintenance and was little used for the rest of war.<ref name=\"brooks\" />\n\nThe airfield was bombed several times and a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] was shot down by ground fire during one such attack, crash-landing near the terminal building.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pocock|first1=D A|title=The Royal Air Force Regiment; The Formative years to 1946|journal=Journal of the Royal Air Force Historical Society|date=1995|issue=15|page=23|oclc=21256749}}</ref>\n\nA [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] crash-landed at the airfield after being damaged during a raid on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The consequent damage to the old guardhouse on the north side of the airfield can still be seen.\n\n===Post-Second World War===\nThe landing area was entirely grass until a [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] runway was built in 1981.\n\nIn 1949, F G Miles Engineering Ltd moved to Shoreham from Redhill Aerodrome and soon occupied the repaired Municipal Hangar.\n\n[[Beagle Aircraft]] Ltd (British Executive & General Aviation Ltd) was formed at Shoreham on 7 October 1960 and design drawings were begun a few weeks later for a new prototype twin-engine light transport aircraft.
