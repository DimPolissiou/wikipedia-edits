It was loosely based on the story of [[Bea Miles]], known in Sydney for her eccentric public behaviour.<ref>{{cite web | first=Kate | last=Grenville | title =The Novelist as Barbarian | publisher =[[National Library of Australia]] | url =http://www.nla.gov.au/events/history/papers/Kate_Grenville%20.html | accessdate = 2015-07-12}}</ref> It has become one of Australia's best-loved novels and in 1996 was made into a film starring [[Ruth Cracknell]] and [[Toni Collette]]; Collette won the [[Australian Film Institute]] [[AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|award for supporting actress]] for her performance as the young Lilian.\n\n''[[Dreamhouse (novel)|Dreamhouse]]'' followed in 1986, and appeared as the 1994 film ''[[Traps (1994 film)|Traps]]''. ''[[Joan Makes History]]'' \u2013 the recipient of an Australian Bicentennial Commission \u2013 was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1994 Grenville returned to the characters and setting of ''Lilian's Story'' with a companion novel \u2013 ''[[Dark Places (Grenville novel)|Dark Places]]'' \u2013 that re-tells the events of the earlier novel from the point of view of Lilian's incestuous father. ''Dark Places'' won the [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]] in 1995. (In the US this novel is titled ''Albion's Story''.)\n\n''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' appeared in 2000 and won the Orange Prize for Fiction, at the time Britain's richest literary award.\n\nIn 2006 ''[[The Secret River]]'' was published, the first of Grenville's books that take Australia's colonial past, and relations with Australia's indigenous people, as their subject. ''The Secret River'' was inspired by the story of Grenville's own great-great-great grandfather, a [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] sent to Australia from London in 1806.  This book won the Commonwealth Prize,<ref>Richard Lea, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/08/news.awardsandprizes \"Kate Grenville to meet the Queen\"], ''The Guardian'', 8 May 2006.</ref> the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Christina Stead Prize for Fiction|Christina Stead Award]], and the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Community Relations Commission Award|NSW Premier's Community Relations Prize]], and was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n''Searching for The Secret River'' (2006) is a memoir about the research and writing of the novel, tracing the journey of the author's increasing awareness of how Australia's colonial past informs its present.\n\n''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008) is set thirty years earlier than ''The Secret River''. Based on the historical notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (British Marines officer)|William Dawes]], it tells the story of the friendship between a soldier with the [[First Fleet]] and a young [[Gadigal]] girl.  These two novels together explore something of the complexity of black-white relations in Australia's past.\n\n''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'' (2011) is the sequel to ''The Secret River'' and takes up the story of William Thornhill's youngest daughter. It can be read as a stand-alone novel, without reference to ''The Secret River''.\n\nIn 2015 Grenville published ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', in which she uses the fragments of memoir that her mother left to construct the story of a woman whose life - in some ways typical of her times, in other ways remarkable - spanned a century of tumult and dramatic change.\n\nGrenville has also written or co-written several books about the writing process which are widely used in creative writing workshops and in schools and universities: ''The Writing Book'', ''Writing from Start to Finish'', and ''Making Stories'' (co-written with [[Sue Woolfe]]).\n\nIn 2017 she published a book about the politics and health effects of artificial scents, ''The Case Against Fragrance''.\n\nHer latest book (published July 2020) is a novel that takes its inspiration from the life of Elizabeth Macarthur, a settler in early Australia: ''A Room Made of Leaves''.  \n\nGrenville has been awarded fellowships from the International Association of University Women and from the Literary Arts Board of the [[Australia Council]].<ref name = \"Whitlock2\"/> Her novels have all been published in the UK and US as well as Australia and have been translated into many languages, including German, Swedish, French, Hebrew and Chinese. Two have been made into feature films. ''The Secret River'' was made into a TV mini-series, and adapted (by Andrew Bovell) as a play that had sell-out runs at the Adelaide and Edinburgh Festivals.\n\n==Style and subject matter==\n\nGrenville's early fiction presented characters trying to free themselves from social and gender stereotypes.  ''Bearded Ladies'' is a collection of short stories about women trying to free themselves from the gender stereotypes of their society.\n\n''Lilian's Story'', set in the early 20th century, takes as its subject a woman who rejects her middle-class background and the conventional future that is expected of her, and instead chooses to live as a street person, making a living by offering recitations from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. At the end of her life she declares joyously: \"Drive on, George. I am ready for whatever comes next.\"\n\n''Joan Makes History'' is a satirical re-writing of Australia's history, foregrounding the women rather than the men. Joan is an Everywoman character who in various guises lives through all the iconic moments of Australia's past. She \"makes history\" both by simply living her life, and by (re)making history by writing it.\n\n''Dreamhouse'' is a black comedy about a marriage on the rocks. It explores themes of both men and women freeing themselves from stereotypes to accept their true selves. Both partners in the marriage are attracted to their own sex: the wife is prepared to acknowledge that and act on it while the husband refuses to.\n\n''The Idea of Perfection'' is about people haunted by the impossible ideal  of perfection. The two main characters are both middle-aged and frumpish, and consider themselves unlovably flawed.  The journey they make is to recognise that to be \"imperfect\" is simply to be human, and carries its own power. As the epigraph from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] asserts: \"An arch is two weaknesses that together make a strength\".\n\n''The Secret River'' is set in early 19th-century Australia and is based on the story of one of Grenville's convict ancestors, [[Solomon Wiseman]], a London boatman transported for theft.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret River|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|work=One Hundred exhibition|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=25 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207193245/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|archive-date=7 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> She takes that story as a means of exploring a wider theme: the dark legacy of [[colonialism]], especially its impact on Australia's Aboriginal peoples. The title comes from the anthropologist [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W. E. H. Stanner]], who wrote about a \"secret river of blood flowing through Australia's history\": the story of white Australia's relationship with the Aboriginal people.\n\nGrenville has written a memoir of the research and writing of ''The Secret River'', entitled ''Searching for the Secret River''.\n\n''The Lieutenant'' is the story of one of the very earliest moments of black-white relationship in Australia, at the time of first settlement in 1788. Based on a historical source \u2013 the [[Gadigal]]-language notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)|William Dawes]] \u2013 the novel tells the story of a unique friendship. In learning the Gadigal language from a young girl, Dawes wrote down word-for-word parts of their conversations. Grenville has used these fragments as the basis for a novel exploring how it might be possible for two people to reach across the gulfs of language and culture that separate them, and arrive at a relationship of mutual warmth and respect. She has described it as a \"mirror-image\" of ''The Secret River.''\n\n''Sarah Thornhill'' is a sequel to ''The Secret River''.  It tells the story of one of the children of the main character in the earlier book. Sarah Thornhill grows up knowing nothing of the dark secret in her family's past, and when she has to confront it, the direction of her life and her thinking is changed.  It's a story about secrets and lies, and how to deal with a dark legacy from the past. Grenville has said that the book is set in the 19th century, but is as much about the ugly secrets in Australian history that her own generation inherited.\n\nThese three books form a loose trilogy \u2013 \"The Colonial Trilogy\" \u2013 about the first three generations of white settlement in Australia, and what that shared black/white history means for contemporary Australians.  The themes of the three books reach beyond Australia: all are widely read in other countries where colonialism has left a problematic legacy.\n\nGrenville frequently does extensive research for her novels, often using historical or other sources as the starting-point for the work of the imagination. She says of her books that they are \"sometimes inspired by historical events, but they are imaginative constructs, not an attempt to write history\".<ref name=\"PE\"/>\n\nSome years after her mother died, Grenville put together a book about her, based on the memoirs and recordings her mother left.  The result is ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', a book about a woman born in 1912 who rode the waves of tumultuous change that happened over the course of her life.\n\nGrenville's most recent non-fiction book is about the health problems that can be caused by the synthetic fragrances that are all around us: ''The Case Against Fragrance''.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA) in 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr Kate Grenville FAHA|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/our-fellows/fellows/?find_contact_id=3029&section_select=0&fellowType_select=0&bio_search&name_search=grenville&membership_since_search&country_search=0&state_search=0|website=Australian Academy of the Humanities|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of New South Wales]]<ref name=about/> in 2010\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Sydney<ref name=about>{{Cite web |url = http://kategrenville.com/biography |title = About Kate Grenville |accessdate = 27 November 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141225095143/http://kategrenville.com/biography |archivedate = 25 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> in 2012\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from [[Macquarie University]] in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mq.edu.au/newsroom/2013/04/19/celebrated-australian-writer-kate-grenville-receives-an-honorary-doctorate/|title = Celebrated Australian writer Kate Grenville receives an honorary doctorate|date = 19 April 2013|accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = Macquarie University|last = |first = }}</ref>\n* The Dixson Medal awarded by the [[Library Council of New South Wales]] in 2014<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |title = 2014 Honours of the Library Council of New South Wales |accessdate = 12 July 2015 |publisher = State Library of New South Wales |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171927/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |archivedate = 1 May 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature from the Australia Council in 2017\n* AO in 2018\n\n===Prizes===\n* 1984 \u2013 [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]] for ''Lilian's Story''\n* 1995 \u2013 [[Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction|Victorian Premier's Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction]] for ''Dark Places''<ref>http://www.literaryawards.com.au/victorianpremiers.html</ref>\n* 2001 \u2013 [[Orange Prize for Fiction]] for ''[[The Idea of Perfection]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for ''[[The Secret River]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Christina Stead Prize for fiction for ''The Secret River''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Community Relations Commission Award for ''The Secret River''\n\n\n===Shortlisted===\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[The Secret River]]'' \u2013 [[Miles Franklin Award]] and the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Short story collections===\n*''Bearded Ladies:Stories'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-7022-1716-6}}\n\n===Novels===\n*''Lilian's Story'' (1985), {{ISBN|1-86448-284-2}}\n*''Dreamhouse'' (1986), {{ISBN|0-7022-1959-2}}\n*''Joan Makes History: A Novel'' (1988), {{ISBN|0-7022-2174-0}}\n*''Dark Places'' (1994), {{ISBN|0-330-33549-9}} (alternative title: ''Albion's Story'')\n*''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' (1999)\n*''[[The Secret River]]'' (2005)\n*''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'', sequel to ''The Secret River'', (2011)\n*''A Room Made of Leaves'' (2020)<ref>[https://www.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/latestnews/kate-grenville-new-2020.html \"Kate Grenville releasing new book, A Room Made of Leaves, in 2020\"], ''Good Reading''.</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''The Writing Book: A Manual for Fiction Writers'' (1990), {{ISBN|0-04-442124-9}}\n*''Making Stories: How Ten Australian Novels Were Written'' (1993), with Woolfe, Sue {{ISBN|1-86373-316-7}}\n*''Writing from Start to Finish: a Six-Step Guide'' (2001)\n*''Searching for the Secret River'' (2006), {{ISBN|1-921145-39-0}}\n*''One Life: My Mother's Story'' (2015), {{ISBN|978-1-922182-05-0}}\n*''The Case Against Fragrance'' (2017), {{ISBN|978-1-925355-95-6}}.\n\n===Translations===\nGrenville's work has appeared in: Swedish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Czech, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Norwegian, Greek,  Mandarin and Japanese.<!--unsure why this list is here in such a vague way: which books appeared in which languages?

She lives in Sydney with her son and daughter. Her leisure activities include learning to play the cello<ref name=\"bio\"/> and performing in an amateur orchestra.\n\n==Career==\n\nKate Grenville's reputation as a short story writer was made by the publication in 1984 of her collection ''[[Bearded Ladies]]''.<ref name = \"Whitlock2\">Whitlock (1989), p. 2.</ref> On its publication, [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] wrote \"Here is someone who can really write\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n''[[Lilian's Story]]'' was her first published novel (1985) and won [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]]. It was loosely based on the story of [[Bea Miles]], known in Sydney for her eccentric public behaviour.<ref>{{cite web | first=Kate | last=Grenville | title =The Novelist as Barbarian | publisher =[[National Library of Australia]] | url =http://www.nla.gov.au/events/history/papers/Kate_Grenville%20.html | accessdate = 2015-07-12}}</ref> It has become one of Australia's best-loved novels and in 1996 was made into a film starring [[Ruth Cracknell]] and [[Toni Collette]]; Collette won the [[Australian Film Institute]] [[AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|award for supporting actress]] for her performance as the young Lilian.\n\n''[[Dreamhouse (novel)|Dreamhouse]]'' followed in 1986, and appeared as the 1994 film ''[[Traps (1994 film)|Traps]]''. ''[[Joan Makes History]]'' \u2013 the recipient of an Australian Bicentennial Commission \u2013 was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1994 Grenville returned to the characters and setting of ''Lilian's Story'' with a companion novel \u2013 ''[[Dark Places (Grenville novel)|Dark Places]]'' \u2013 that re-tells the events of the earlier novel from the point of view of Lilian's incestuous father. ''Dark Places'' won the [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]] in 1995. (In the US this novel is titled ''Albion's Story''.)\n\n''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' appeared in 2000 and won the Orange Prize for Fiction, at the time Britain's richest literary award.\n\nIn 2006 ''[[The Secret River]]'' was published, the first of Grenville's books that take Australia's colonial past, and relations with Australia's indigenous people, as their subject. ''The Secret River'' was inspired by the story of Grenville's own great-great-great grandfather, a [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] sent to Australia from London in 1806.  This book won the Commonwealth Prize,<ref>Richard Lea, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/08/news.awardsandprizes \"Kate Grenville to meet the Queen\"], ''The Guardian'', 8 May 2006.</ref> the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Christina Stead Prize for Fiction|Christina Stead Award]], and the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Community Relations Commission Award|NSW Premier's Community Relations Prize]], and was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n''Searching for The Secret River'' (2006) is a memoir about the research and writing of the novel, tracing the journey of the author's increasing awareness of how Australia's colonial past informs its present.\n\n''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008) is set thirty years earlier than ''The Secret River''. Based on the historical notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (British Marines officer)|William Dawes]], it tells the story of the friendship between a soldier with the [[First Fleet]] and a young [[Gadigal]] girl.  These two novels together explore something of the complexity of black-white relations in Australia's past.\n\n''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'' (2011) is the sequel to ''The Secret River'' and takes up the story of William Thornhill's youngest daughter. It can be read as a stand-alone novel, without reference to ''The Secret River''.\n\nIn 2015 Grenville published ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', in which she uses the fragments of memoir that her mother left to construct the story of a woman whose life - in some ways typical of her times, in other ways remarkable - spanned a century of tumult and dramatic change.\n\nGrenville has also written or co-written several books about the writing process which are widely used in creative writing workshops and in schools and universities: ''The Writing Book'', ''Writing from Start to Finish'', and ''Making Stories'' (co-written with [[Sue Woolfe]]).\n\nIn 2017 she published a book about the politics and health effects of artificial scents, ''The Case Against Fragrance''.\n\nHer latest book (published July 2020) is a novel that takes its inspiration from the life of Elizabeth Macarthur, a settler in early Australia: ''A Room Made of Leaves''.  \n\nGrenville has been awarded fellowships from the International Association of University Women and from the Literary Arts Board of the [[Australia Council]].<ref name = \"Whitlock2\"/> Her novels have all been published in the UK and US as well as Australia and have been translated into many languages, including German, Swedish, French, Hebrew and Chinese. Two have been made into feature films. ''The Secret River'' was made into a TV mini-series, and adapted (by Andrew Bovell) as a play that had sell-out runs at the Adelaide and Edinburgh Festivals.\n\n==Style and subject matter==\n\nGrenville's early fiction presented characters trying to free themselves from social and gender stereotypes.  ''Bearded Ladies'' is a collection of short stories about women trying to free themselves from the gender stereotypes of their society.\n\n''Lilian's Story'', set in the early 20th century, takes as its subject a woman who rejects her middle-class background and the conventional future that is expected of her, and instead chooses to live as a street person, making a living by offering recitations from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. At the end of her life she declares joyously: \"Drive on, George. I am ready for whatever comes next.\"\n\n''Joan Makes History'' is a satirical re-writing of Australia's history, foregrounding the women rather than the men. Joan is an Everywoman character who in various guises lives through all the iconic moments of Australia's past. She \"makes history\" both by simply living her life, and by (re)making history by writing it.\n\n''Dreamhouse'' is a black comedy about a marriage on the rocks. It explores themes of both men and women freeing themselves from stereotypes to accept their true selves. Both partners in the marriage are attracted to their own sex: the wife is prepared to acknowledge that and act on it while the husband refuses to.\n\n''The Idea of Perfection'' is about people haunted by the impossible ideal  of perfection. The two main characters are both middle-aged and frumpish, and consider themselves unlovably flawed.  The journey they make is to recognise that to be \"imperfect\" is simply to be human, and carries its own power. As the epigraph from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] asserts: \"An arch is two weaknesses that together make a strength\".\n\n''The Secret River'' is set in early 19th-century Australia and is based on the story of one of Grenville's convict ancestors, [[Solomon Wiseman]], a London boatman transported for theft.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret River|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|work=One Hundred exhibition|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=25 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207193245/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|archive-date=7 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> She takes that story as a means of exploring a wider theme: the dark legacy of [[colonialism]], especially its impact on Australia's Aboriginal peoples. The title comes from the anthropologist [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W. E. H. Stanner]], who wrote about a \"secret river of blood flowing through Australia's history\": the story of white Australia's relationship with the Aboriginal people.\n\nGrenville has written a memoir of the research and writing of ''The Secret River'', entitled ''Searching for the Secret River''.\n\n''The Lieutenant'' is the story of one of the very earliest moments of black-white relationship in Australia, at the time of first settlement in 1788. Based on a historical source \u2013 the [[Gadigal]]-language notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)|William Dawes]] \u2013 the novel tells the story of a unique friendship. In learning the Gadigal language from a young girl, Dawes wrote down word-for-word parts of their conversations. Grenville has used these fragments as the basis for a novel exploring how it might be possible for two people to reach across the gulfs of language and culture that separate them, and arrive at a relationship of mutual warmth and respect. She has described it as a \"mirror-image\" of ''The Secret River.''\n\n''Sarah Thornhill'' is a sequel to ''The Secret River''.  It tells the story of one of the children of the main character in the earlier book. Sarah Thornhill grows up knowing nothing of the dark secret in her family's past, and when she has to confront it, the direction of her life and her thinking is changed.  It's a story about secrets and lies, and how to deal with a dark legacy from the past. Grenville has said that the book is set in the 19th century, but is as much about the ugly secrets in Australian history that her own generation inherited.\n\nThese three books form a loose trilogy \u2013 \"The Colonial Trilogy\" \u2013 about the first three generations of white settlement in Australia, and what that shared black/white history means for contemporary Australians.  The themes of the three books reach beyond Australia: all are widely read in other countries where colonialism has left a problematic legacy.\n\nGrenville frequently does extensive research for her novels, often using historical or other sources as the starting-point for the work of the imagination. She says of her books that they are \"sometimes inspired by historical events, but they are imaginative constructs, not an attempt to write history\".<ref name=\"PE\"/>\n\nSome years after her mother died, Grenville put together a book about her, based on the memoirs and recordings her mother left.  The result is ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', a book about a woman born in 1912 who rode the waves of tumultuous change that happened over the course of her life.\n\nGrenville's most recent non-fiction book is about the health problems that can be caused by the synthetic fragrances that are all around us: ''The Case Against Fragrance''.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA) in 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr Kate Grenville FAHA|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/our-fellows/fellows/?find_contact_id=3029&section_select=0&fellowType_select=0&bio_search&name_search=grenville&membership_since_search&country_search=0&state_search=0|website=Australian Academy of the Humanities|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of New South Wales]]<ref name=about/> in 2010\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Sydney<ref name=about>{{Cite web |url = http://kategrenville.com/biography |title = About Kate Grenville |accessdate = 27 November 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141225095143/http://kategrenville.com/biography |archivedate = 25 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> in 2012\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from [[Macquarie University]] in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mq.edu.au/newsroom/2013/04/19/celebrated-australian-writer-kate-grenville-receives-an-honorary-doctorate/|title = Celebrated Australian writer Kate Grenville receives an honorary doctorate|date = 19 April 2013|accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = Macquarie University|last = |first = }}</ref>\n* The Dixson Medal awarded by the [[Library Council of New South Wales]] in 2014<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |title = 2014 Honours of the Library Council of New South Wales |accessdate = 12 July 2015 |publisher = State Library of New South Wales |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171927/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |archivedate = 1 May 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Prizes===\n* 1984 \u2013 [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]] for ''Lilian's Story''\n* 1995 \u2013 [[Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction|Victorian Premier's Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction]] for ''Dark Places''<ref>http://www.literaryawards.com.au/victorianpremiers.html</ref>\n* 2001 \u2013 [[Orange Prize for Fiction]] for ''[[The Idea of Perfection]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for ''[[The Secret River]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Christina Stead Prize for fiction for ''The Secret River''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Community Relations Commission Award for ''The Secret River''\n\n===Shortlisted===\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[The Secret River]]'' \u2013 [[Miles Franklin Award]] and the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Short story collections===\n*''Bearded Ladies:Stories'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-7022-1716-6}}\n\n===Novels===\n*''Lilian's Story'' (1985), {{ISBN|1-86448-284-2}}\n*''Dreamhouse'' (1986), {{ISBN|0-7022-1959-2}}\n*''Joan Makes History: A Novel'' (1988), {{ISBN|0-7022-2174-0}}\n*''Dark Places'' (1994), {{ISBN|0-330-33549-9}} (alternative title: ''Albion's Story'')\n*''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' (1999)\n*''[[The Secret River]]'' (2005)\n*''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'', sequel to ''The Secret River'', (2011)\n*''A Room Made of Leaves'' (2020)<ref>[https://www.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/latestnews/kate-grenville-new-2020.html \"Kate Grenville releasing new book, A Room Made of Leaves, in 2020\"], ''Good Reading''.</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''The Writing Book: A Manual for Fiction Writers'' (1990), {{ISBN|0-04-442124-9}}\n*''Making Stories: How Ten Australian Novels Were Written'' (1993), with Woolfe, Sue {{ISBN|1-86373-316-7}}\n*''Writing from Start to Finish: a Six-Step Guide'' (2001)\n*''Searching for the Secret River'' (2006), {{ISBN|1-921145-39-0}}\n*''One Life: My Mother's Story'' (2015), {{ISBN|978-1-922182-05-0}}\n*''The Case Against Fragrance'' (2017), {{ISBN|978-1-925355-95-6}}.\n\n===Translations===\nGrenville's work has appeared in: Swedish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Czech, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Norwegian, Greek,  Mandarin and Japanese.<!--unsure why this list is here in such a vague way: which books appeared in which languages?

bearer's name (or, less often, some attribute or function) in a [[visual pun]] or [[rebus]]. The term was derived from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''cant'', meaning song or singing.\n\nFrench heralds used the term ''armes parlantes'' ({{Lang-en|\"talking arms\"}}), as they would sound out the name of the armiger. Many armorial allusions require research for elucidation because of changes in language and dialect that have occurred over the past millennium.\n\nCanting arms \u2013 some in the form of rebuses \u2013 are quite common in German civic heraldry. They have also been increasingly used in the 20th century among the British royal family.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When the visual representation is not straightforward but as complex as a [[rebus]], this is sometimes called a ''rebus coat of arms''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\nAn [[in-joke]] among the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] heralds is the [[pun]], \"Heralds don't pun; they cant.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Neznanich, Modar|title=Heraldry for Those Who Cant|url=http://www.modaruniversity.org/Heraldry-for-Those-Who-Cant.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2012}} Cites 72 historical examples of canting arms, as well as SCA usage.</ref>\n\n== Examples of canting arms ==\n\n=== Personal coat of arms ===\nA famous example of canting arms are those of [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] (consort of King [[George VI]] of the United Kingdom).

These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 59, 64</ref  ojfjkhkjhdkjhjhjhjhjehuhekjhkejhkjkjhkjhjehkjhj-0878i9o776\n>\n\n===Small size notes===\n[[File:First Small Size Silver Certificate (face, 1928).jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 Silver Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $1 1928 Silver Certificate reverse.jpg|thumb|250px|Common reverse of $1 Silver Certificates (Series of 1928-1934) and $1 United States Notes ([[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]), commonly referred to as \"Funnybacks\"]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1928-Fr.1500.jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 United States Banknote printed.]]\n''(6.14 length \u00d7 2.61 width\u00d7 0.0043 in thickness  = 156 \u00d7 66.3 \u00d7 0.11&nbsp;mm)''\n\nIn 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] under [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 $1 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray {{sc|ONE}} replaced the blue \"{{small|1 DOLLAR}}.\" The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 $1 bill, but the center featured a large ornate {{sc|ONE}} superimposed by {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. These are commonly known as \"Funnybacks\" due to the rather odd-looking \"ONE\" on the reverse. These $1 silver certificates were issued until 1934.\n\nIn 1933, [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]] $1 [[United States Note]]s were issued to supplement the supply of $1 Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these $1 bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcurrencyvalues.com/1928_one_dollar_red_seal/|title=Series of 1928 One Dollar Red Seal United States Note \u2013 Values and Pricing - Sell Old Currency|website=OldCurrencyValues.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the design of the $1 silver certificate was changed.  This occurred with that year's passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2012/05/silver-purchase-act-of-1934-united.html|title=Encyclopedia of Money: Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (United States)|website=encyclopedia-of-money.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>  Under Washington's portrait, {{sc|ONE SILVER DOLLAR}} was changed to {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over {{sc|ONE}}, and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.\n\nA year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray {{sc|ONE}} to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by {{sc|WASHINGTON D.C.}}, and a stylized {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}} was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}.\n\n[[File:US $1 1935A North Africa Silver Certificate.jpg|thumb|250px|Special issue $1 Silver Certificate for Allied troops in North Africa]]\n\n[[World War II]] brought about [[Hawaii overprint note|special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.]]\nSpecial $1 Silver Certificates were issued for [[Hawaii]] in case of a Japanese invasion. {{sc|HAWAII}} was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe. The only difference on these one-dollar bills was a yellow instead of blue seal. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.\n\nThe next change came in 1957 when the $1 bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}; it was added over the word {{sc|ONE}} on the reverse. Initially the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto.\n\nThe final production of $1 Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.\n\nProduction of one-dollar [[Federal Reserve Note]]s was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete $1 Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word \"one,\" which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated.  The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe first change since then came in 1969, when the $1 was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new [[Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], with English wording instead of Latin.<ref>http://www.onedollarbill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nThe $1 bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas FRB]] was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/groups/f1988as.txt |title=data|website=uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n\nThough bill denominations of $5 and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the $1 or $2 bills.\n\n====Experimental issues====\n{{Main|Web notes}}\nSince 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.\n\nIn 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B\u2013B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.\n\nA better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red \"S\" to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red ''R''. Because they have some collector value, fake red S's and R's have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note's serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.\n\nSometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v15n22a21.html|title=THE GILBERT PAPER CO $1 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES, SERIES 1963|website=www.CoinBooks.org|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia FRB]] as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.\n\nIn August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond FRB]], with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (note that many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of $10 star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the $1.\n\nOne-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a [[Offset printing#Web-fed litho|web-fed]] [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/general/webs.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Web Notes|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The image from the dollar bill above shows the subject flipped horizontally for ease of comparison.]]\nThe portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A\u2013L), identifying it among the twelve [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal [[Federal Reserve System]] seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.\n\nTo the right of George Washington is the [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department seal]]\nThe scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n\nBelow the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the [[Treasurer of the United States]], and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s signature. To the left of the Secretary's signature is the [[Series (United States currency)|series]] date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note's appearance such as a new currency design.\n\nOn the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s.  A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If \"FW\" appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] facility in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. No \"FW\" means the bill was made at the main plant in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n==Reverse of current $1 bill==\n\n[[File:1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s conditional approval of the one-dollar bill's design in 1935, requiring that the appearance of the sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] be reversed, and together, captioned.]]\nThe reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to the left and right of the word ''ONE''. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and [[serif]]fed typeface. A smaller image of the word \"ONE\" is superimposed over the numeral \"1\" in each of the four corners of the bill.\n\n\"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" spans the top of the bill, \"ONE DOLLAR\" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central \"ONE\" are the words \"[[In God We Trust|IN GOD WE TRUST]],\" which became the official [[motto]] of the United States in 1956 by an [[Act of Congress]]. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words \"THE GREAT SEAL,\" and below the obverse on the right side are the words \"OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nThe Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill's design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.\n\nThe reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the [[Eye of Providence]] within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of [[American Revolution|American independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, \"[[Annuit c\u0153ptis|ANNUIT COEPTIS]],\" meaning \"He favors our undertaking.\" At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming \"[[Novus ordo seclorum|NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM]]\" meaning \"New Order of the Ages\" that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.\n\nThe obverse of the seal on the right features a [[bald eagle]], the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and symbol of the United States. Above the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a [[six-pointed star]]. The eagle's breast is covered by a [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the [[American flag]]. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"[[E pluribus unum|E PLURIBUS UNUM]]\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a ''de facto'' motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).  Both the phrases \"E Pluribus Unum\" and \"Annuit coeptis\" contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an [[olive branch]] with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.  A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==\nExcept for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (those from others are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value.  However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.\n\nIn 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas.  Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter \"K\", for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number \"11\" and a \"K\" surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot in Dallas in November 1963.  The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Kennedy-bills-have-eerie-connection-with-his-assassination-233045691.html|title=Kennedy bills have eerie connection with his assassination|first=NewsCenter16|last=Staff|website=WNDU.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968\u201369 [[Joseph W. Barr]] was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill.  Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed.  Thus they are very common.<ref>[https://www.papermoneyauction.com/rare-or-not-rare-the-1963-b-1-dollar-barr-note Rare or Not Rare: The 1963-B $1 Dollar Barr Note]</ref>\n\nDollar Bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or \u201cpalindrome\u201c notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same if you read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists.  Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number.

Both notes featured the same reverse and an almost identical obverse with the same border design and portrait of George Washington. The only difference between the two notes was the color of ink used for the numeral 1 crossed by the word {{sc|DOLLAR}}, [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], and serial numbers along with the wording of the obligations. These dollar bills were the first and only large-size notes with a standardized design for different types of notes of the same denomination; this same concept would later be used on small-size notes.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Paper Money (Whitman) p 59, 64</ref>\n\n===Small size notes===\n[[File:First Small Size Silver Certificate (face, 1928).jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 Silver Certificate.]]\n[[File:US $1 1928 Silver Certificate reverse.jpg|thumb|250px|Common reverse of $1 Silver Certificates (Series of 1928-1934) and $1 United States Notes ([[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]), commonly referred to as \"Funnybacks\"]]\n[[File:US-$1-LT-1928-Fr.1500.jpg|thumb|250px|The first small-size $1 United States Banknote printed.]]\n''(6.14 length \u00d7 2.61 width\u00d7 0.0043 in thickness  = 156 \u00d7 66.3 \u00d7 0.11&nbsp;mm)''\n\nIn 1928, all currency was changed to the size which is familiar today. The first one-dollar bills were issued as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] under [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]]. The Treasury seal and serial numbers were dark blue. The obverse was nearly identical to the Series of 1923 $1 silver certificate, but the Treasury seal featured spikes around it and a large gray {{sc|ONE}} replaced the blue \"{{small|1 DOLLAR}}.\" The reverse, too, had the same border design as the Series of 1923 $1 bill, but the center featured a large ornate {{sc|ONE}} superimposed by {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. These are commonly known as \"Funnybacks\" due to the rather odd-looking \"ONE\" on the reverse. These $1 silver certificates were issued until 1934.\n\nIn 1933, [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]] $1 [[United States Note]]s were issued to supplement the supply of $1 Silver Certificates. Its Treasury seal and serial numbers were red and there was different wording on the obverse of the note. However, a month after their production, it was realized that there would be no real need for these notes and production was stopped. A small number of these $1 bills entered circulation and the rest were kept in Treasury vaults until 1949 when they were issued in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcurrencyvalues.com/1928_one_dollar_red_seal/|title=Series of 1928 One Dollar Red Seal United States Note \u2013 Values and Pricing - Sell Old Currency|website=OldCurrencyValues.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the design of the $1 silver certificate was changed.  This occurred with that year's passage of the Silver Purchase Act, which led to a large increase in dollar bills backed by that metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia-of-money.blogspot.com/2012/05/silver-purchase-act-of-1934-united.html|title=Encyclopedia of Money: Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (United States)|website=encyclopedia-of-money.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>  Under Washington's portrait, {{sc|ONE SILVER DOLLAR}} was changed to {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}}. The Treasury seal was moved to the right and superimposed over {{sc|ONE}}, and a blue numeral 1 was added to the left. The reverse remained the same.\n\nA year later, in 1935, the design of the one-dollar bill was changed again. On the obverse, the blue numeral 1 was changed to gray and made smaller, the gray {{sc|ONE}} to the right was removed, the Treasury seal was made smaller and superimposed by {{sc|WASHINGTON D.C.}}, and a stylized {{sc|ONE DOLLAR}} was added over the treasury seal. The reverse was also changed to its current design, except for the absence of {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}.\n\n[[File:US $1 1935A North Africa Silver Certificate.jpg|thumb|250px|Special issue $1 Silver Certificate for Allied troops in North Africa]]\n\n[[World War II]] brought about [[Hawaii overprint note|special issues of one-dollar bills in 1942.]]\nSpecial $1 Silver Certificates were issued for [[Hawaii]] in case of a Japanese invasion. {{sc|HAWAII}} was printed vertically on the left and right side of the obverse and also horizontally across the reverse. The seal and serial numbers were changed to brown. Special Silver Certificates were also issued as payment for Allied troops in North Africa about to begin their assault into Europe. The only difference on these one-dollar bills was a yellow instead of blue seal. Both of these types of notes could be declared worthless if they fell into enemy hands.\n\nThe next change came in 1957 when the $1 bill became the first piece of paper U.S. currency to bear the motto {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}}; it was added over the word {{sc|ONE}} on the reverse. Initially the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] began printing the motto on notes printed with the new 32 note press, but soon Series of 1935G bills printed on an 18 note press featured the motto.\n\nThe final production of $1 Silver Certificates occurred in late 1963. In 1964, the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver coin ended and in 1968 the redemption of Silver Certificates for silver bullion ended.\n\nProduction of one-dollar [[Federal Reserve Note]]s was undertaken in late 1963 to replace the soon-to-be obsolete $1 Silver Certificate. The design on the reverse remained the same, but the border design on the obverse underwent considerable modification, as the mostly abstract filigrees were replaced with designs that were mostly botanical in nature. In addition, the word \"one,\" which appeared eight times around the border in small type, was eliminated.  The serial numbers and treasury seal were printed in green ink. This was the first time the one-dollar bill was printed as a Federal Reserve Note.\n\nThe first change since then came in 1969, when the $1 was among all denominations of Federal Reserve Notes to feature the new [[Symbols of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury seal]], with English wording instead of Latin.<ref>http://www.onedollarbill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nThe $1 bill became the first denomination printed at the new Western Currency Facility in February 1991, when a shipment of 3.2 million [[Replacement banknote|star notes]] from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas FRB]] was produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/groups/f1988as.txt |title=data|website=uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n\nThough bill denominations of $5 and higher have been redesigned twice since 1995 as part of ongoing anti-counterfeiting efforts, there are currently no plans to redesign the $1 or $2 bills.\n\n====Experimental issues====\n{{Main|Web notes}}\nSince 1933, the one-dollar bill has been the exclusive experimental denomination among circulating US currency (except for the Natick experiment in 1981, see below). The first experiment was conducted in January and February of that year to assess the effects of using different ratios of cotton to linen in the make-up of the bills. Series 1928A and 1928B $1 silver certificates with serial number block letters X-B and Y-B were used as the experimental group; the Z-B block was used as the control group. The results of the experiment were inconclusive.\n\nIn 1937, another test was conducted, similar in style to the 1933 experiment. This test used Series 1935 one-dollar bills. The particular notes used in this experiment can be identified by their serial numbers. Notes ranging from A00000001B to A06180000B and B00000001B\u2013B03300000B were the experimental group and notes ranging from C00000001B to C03300000B were part of the control group. No conclusive results were found.\n\nA better known test was done in 1942 during World War II to test alternative types of paper. This was a precautionary measure in case the current type of paper supply could not be maintained. Series 1935A notes made of the special paper and were printed with a red \"S\" to the right of the treasury seal, while notes of the control group were printed with a red ''R''. Because they have some collector value, fake red S's and R's have been applied to regular Series 1935A notes to try to pass them at a higher value; checking a note's serial numbers can prevent this. Serial numbers of the R group range from S70884001C to S72068000C and serial numbers of the S group range from S73884001C to S75068000C.\n\nSometime in the early to mid-1960s, the BEP experimented with a new firm, the Gilbert Paper Company, to see if they could duplicate the usual paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coinbooks.org/esylum_v15n22a21.html|title=THE GILBERT PAPER CO $1 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES, SERIES 1963|website=www.CoinBooks.org|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> The BEP selected a series of notes printed by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia FRB]] as the test subjects. Serial numbers for this group range from C60800001A to C61440000A.\n\nIn August 1981, a similar experiment occurred during production of Series 1977A, when the BEP printed a few print runs on Natick paper. They included a regular run and a star note run from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond FRB]], with serial numbers ranging from E76800001H through E80640000H and E07052001* through E07680000* (note that many sources incorrectly identify the star range as Philadelphia instead of Richmond). One print run of $10 star notes, also from Richmond, was included in this paper test, making it so far the only experimental printing not exclusive to the $1.\n\nOne-dollar bills were again the subject of experimentation in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a [[Offset printing#Web-fed litho|web-fed]] [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRNs, the BEP sent out REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes within the confines of their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems and operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to {{sc|IN GOD WE TRUST}} and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/general/webs.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Web Notes|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The image from the dollar bill above shows the subject flipped horizontally for ease of comparison.]]\nThe portrait of George Washington is displayed in the center of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the one-dollar bill, as it has been since the 1869 design. The oval containing George Washington is propped up by bunches of bay laurel leaves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTo the left of George Washington is the Federal Reserve District seal. The name of the Federal Reserve Bank that issued the note encircles a capital letter (A\u2013L), identifying it among the twelve [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. The sequential number of the bank (1: A, 2: B, etc.) is also displayed in the four corners of the open space on the bill. Until the redesign of the higher denominations of currency beginning in 1996, this seal was found on all denominations of Federal Reserve notes. Since then it is only present on the $1 and $2 notes, with the higher denominations only displaying a universal [[Federal Reserve System]] seal, and the bank letter and number beneath the upper left serial number.\n\nTo the right of George Washington is the [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department seal]]\nThe scales represent justice. The chevron with thirteen stars represents the original thirteen colonies. The key below the chevron represents authority and trust; 1789 is the year that the Department of the Treasury was established. The series 1969 dollar bills were the first to use a simplified Treasury seal, with the wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n\nBelow the FRB seal (to the left of George Washington) is the signature of the [[Treasurer of the United States]], and below the USDT Seal (right side) is the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]'s signature. To the left of the Secretary's signature is the [[Series (United States currency)|series]] date. A new series date, or addition or change of a sequential letter under a date, results from a change in the Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United States, and/or a change to the note's appearance such as a new currency design.\n\nOn the edges are olive branches entwined around the 1s.  A small plate serial number-letter combination is on the lower right, and a small plate position (check) letter is on the upper left corner of the note. If \"FW\" appears before the lower right plate number it indicates that the bill was produced at the satellite [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] facility in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. Currency has been printed here since Series 1988A. No \"FW\" means the bill was made at the main plant in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n==Reverse of current $1 bill==\n\n[[File:1935 Dollar Bill Back Early Design.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]'s conditional approval of the one-dollar bill's design in 1935, requiring that the appearance of the sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]] be reversed, and together, captioned.]]\nThe reverse of the one-dollar bill has an ornate design that incorporates both sides of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to the left and right of the word ''ONE''. This word appears prominently in the white space at the center of the bill in a capitalized, shadowed, and [[serif]]fed typeface. A smaller image of the word \"ONE\" is superimposed over the numeral \"1\" in each of the four corners of the bill.\n\n\"THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" spans the top of the bill, \"ONE DOLLAR\" is emblazoned along the bottom, and above the central \"ONE\" are the words \"[[In God We Trust|IN GOD WE TRUST]],\" which became the official [[motto]] of the United States in 1956 by an [[Act of Congress]]. Below the reverse of the Great Seal on the left side of the bill are the words \"THE GREAT SEAL,\" and below the obverse on the right side are the words \"OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nThe Great Seal, originally designed in 1782 and added to the dollar bill's design in 1935, is surrounded by an elaborate floral design. The renderings used were the typical official government versions used since the 1880s.\n\nThe reverse of the seal on the left features a barren landscape dominated by an unfinished pyramid of 13 steps, topped by the [[Eye of Providence]] within a triangle. At the base of the pyramid are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776), the date of [[American Revolution|American independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. At the top of the seal stands a Latin phrase, \"[[Annuit c\u0153ptis|ANNUIT COEPTIS]],\" meaning \"He favors our undertaking.\" At the bottom of the seal is a semicircular banner proclaiming \"[[Novus ordo seclorum|NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM]]\" meaning \"New Order of the Ages\" that is a reference to the new American era. To the left of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.\n\nThe obverse of the seal on the right features a [[bald eagle]], the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and symbol of the United States. Above the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a [[six-pointed star]]. The eagle's breast is covered by a [[heraldry|heraldic]] shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the [[American flag]]. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"[[E pluribus unum|E PLURIBUS UNUM]]\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a ''de facto'' motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956).  Both the phrases \"E Pluribus Unum\" and \"Annuit coeptis\" contain 13 letters. In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an [[olive branch]] with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill.  A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n== Collecting Federal Reserve dollar bills ==\nExcept for significant errors, and series 1988A web notes printed in small batches for some of the Federal Reserve districts (those from others are more common), green seal dollars are of little collector value.  However, two notes have generated public interest, although neither is scarce.\n\nIn 1963 dollar bills were produced for the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, headquartered in Dallas.  Since the FRD jurisdictions are sequentially numbered, notes received the corresponding letter \"K\", for the 11th letter of the alphabet. Some people noticed that the 1963 Dallas note, with the number \"11\" and a \"K\" surrounded by a black seal, appeared about the time President [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot in Dallas in November 1963.  The bill was not a commemorative issue and there was no connection between it and the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/Kennedy-bills-have-eerie-connection-with-his-assassination-233045691.html|title=Kennedy bills have eerie connection with his assassination|first=NewsCenter16|last=Staff|website=WNDU.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968\u201369 [[Joseph W. Barr]] was Secretary of the Treasury for only 31 days and his signature appeared solely on the 1963B dollar bill.  Some collectors thought that his brief tenure might make these notes valuable, but use of their plates continued for some time after his term in office and 458,880,000 were printed.  Thus they are very common.<ref>[https://www.papermoneyauction.com/rare-or-not-rare-the-1963-b-1-dollar-barr-note Rare or Not Rare: The 1963-B $1 Dollar Barr Note]</ref>\n\nDollar Bills with interesting serial numbers can also be collected. One example of this is radar or \u201cpalindrome\u201c notes, where the numbers in the serial number are the same if you read from left to right or right to left. Very low serial numbers, or a long block of the same or repeating digits may also be of interest to specialists.  Another example is replacement notes, which have a star to the right of the serial number. The star designates that there was a printing error on one or more of the bills, and it has been replaced by one from a run specifically printed and numbered to be replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/why-do-some-us-bills-have-a-star-instead-of-a-letter-at-the-end-of-the-serial-number.htm|title=Why do some U.S. bills have a star instead of a letter at the end of the serial number?|website=www.howstuffworks.com|access-date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>  Star notes may have some additional value depending on their condition, their year series or if they have an unusual serial number sequence.  To determine the rarity of modern star notes, production tables are maintained.<ref>[http://www.mycurrencycollection.com/reference/star-notes/1 $1 Star Note Tables]</ref>\n\n== Prosecution for the possession of a $1 bill ==\nIn Turkey the possession of a one-dollar bill can lead to a prosecution and sentence for terror related charges because it is seen as evidence for being a member of the [[G\u00fclen movement|G\u00fclen Movement]] founded by [[Fethullah G\u00fclen]], which is seen as a terror organization in Turkey.

It changed its name to the '''British Union of Fascists and National Socialists''' in 1936 and, in 1937, to '''British Union'''. It was disbanded in 1940, after it was [[proscription|proscribed]] by the British government following the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe BUF emerged in 1932 from the [[far-right politics in the United Kingdom|British far-right]], following the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following. The press baron [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the [[Fascist Defence Force]], isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [[Nazi]]-style [[anti-semitism]] in 1936 led to increasingly violent anti-fascist disruptions, notably the 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. The [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as \"Blackshirts\" after the uniforms they wore.\n\nGrowing British hostility towards [[Nazi Germany]], with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi \"[[fifth column]]\". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [[Defence Regulation 18B]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumb|Flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement.]]\n[[Oswald Mosley]] was the youngest elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP before [[crossing the floor]] in 1922, joining first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Independent Labour Party]].

He immediately formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], with policies based on his memorandum. Despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] in early 1931, however, the party failed to achieve any other electoral success.<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=BUF+50,000+members#v=onepage|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\"/> The next year, after a January 1932 visit to [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, ''The Greater Britain'', and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932.<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\">Thorpe, Andrew.

This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.\n\nBUF support for [[Edward VIII]] and the peace campaign to prevent a second [[World War II|World War]] saw membership and public support rise once more.<ref name=\"thurlow94\">Richard C.

Many felt the movement's energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF's economic policies would offer them true equality \u2013 unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women's skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.<ref>Martin Pugh, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/why-the-british-union-fascist-movement-appealed-to-so-many-women.html \"Why the Former Suffragettes Flocked to British Fascism\"], ''Slate'', 14 April 2017.

It changed its name to the '''British Union of Fascists and National Socialists''' in 1936 and, in 1937, to '''British Union'''. It was disbanded in 1940, after it was [[proscription|proscribed]] by the British government following the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe BUF emerged in 1932 from the [[far-right politics in the United Kingdom|British far-right]], following the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]. The BUF's foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following. The press baron [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-Fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the [[Fascist Defence Force]], isolated the party from much of its following. The party's embrace of [[Nazi]]-style [[anti-semitism]] in 1936 led to increasingly violent anti-fascist disruptions, notably the 1936 [[Battle of Cable Street]] in [[London]]'s [[East End]]. The [[Public Order Act 1936]], which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as \"Blackshirts\" after the uniforms they wore.\n\nGrowing British hostility towards [[Nazi Germany]], with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement's membership. It was finally banned by the British government in 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi \"[[fifth column]]\". A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under [[Defence Regulation 18B]].\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:History of British Fascism.png|thumb|Flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement.]]\n[[Oswald Mosley]] was the youngest elected [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP before [[crossing the floor]] in 1922, joining first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Independent Labour Party]]. He became a minister in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Second MacDonald Ministry|Labour government]], advising on rising unemployment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1930, Mosley issued his Mosley Memorandum, which fused [[protectionism]] with a proto-[[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] programme of policies designed to tackle the problem of unemployment, and he resigned from the Labour party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]], with policies based on his memorandum. Despite winning 16% of the vote at a by-election in [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]] in early 1931, however, the party failed to achieve any other electoral success.<ref>{{cite book|last= Powell|first= David|date=2004|title=British Politics,1910-35 - The Crisis of the Party System|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ch22p6goYYkC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=BUF+50,000+members#v=onepage|location=|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 9780415351065}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by [[Fascism]].<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\"/> The next year, after a January 1932 visit to [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, ''The Greater Britain'', and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932.<ref name=\"Britaininthe1930s\">Thorpe, Andrew.

This anti-semitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party's focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.\n\nBUF support for [[Edward VIII]] and the peace campaign to prevent a second [[World War II|World War]] saw membership and public support rise once more.<ref name=\"thurlow94\">Richard C.

At that meeting Mosley announced that \"he was glad indeed to have the opportunity of introducing the first candidate, and ...

Many felt the movement's energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF's economic policies would offer them true equality \u2013 unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women's skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.<ref>Martin Pugh, [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/04/why-the-british-union-fascist-movement-appealed-to-so-many-women.html \"Why the Former Suffragettes Flocked to British Fascism\"], ''Slate'', 14 April 2017.

A Mosley speech is heard on the radio in the scene before everyone goes to the movies.\n* The first depiction of Mosley and the BUF in fiction occurred in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel, ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1932), where Mosley is depicted as Everard Webley, the murderous leader of the \"BFF\", the Brotherhood of Free Fascists, and comes to a nasty end.\n\n[[File:Blackshorts.svg|thumb|right|150px|Emblem of [[P.

The history of the BUF and Mosley is recapitulated.\n* In [[Ken Follett]]'s novel ''[[Night Over Water]]'', several of the main characters are BUF members. In his book ''[[Winter of the World]]'', the Battle of Cable Street plays a role and some of the characters are involved in the BUF or in the anti-BUF organisations.\n* The BUF is also in [[Guy Walters]]' book ''The Leader'' (2003), where Mosley is the dictator of Britain in the 1930s.\n* The British humorous writer [[P.

Lord Beaverbrook is Prime Minister of an authoritarian coalition government. Blackshirts tend to be auxiliary policemen.\n* In the film, ''[[The King's Speech]]'', a brief shot shows a brick wall in London plastered with posters, some reading \"Fascism is Practical Patriotism\" and others, \"Stand by the King\". Both sets of posters were put up by British Blackshirts, who supported [[King Edward VIII]]. Some historians believe Edward had fascist leanings.<ref>Ziegler, ''King Edward VIII: The official biography'', p. 392</ref>\n* In the war strategy video game ''[[Hearts of Iron IV]]'' (2016), certain options can be used to increase fascist leaning in the United Kingdom. Doing so can eventually lead to the British Union of Fascists becoming the ruling party, with Oswald Mosley as the nation's leader.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hoi4wiki.com/United_Kingdom#Political_Parties|title=United Kingdom - Hearts of Iron 4 Wiki|website=www.hoi4wiki.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref> The country's name will change to the British Empire and its flag will be replaced with a Union Flag defaced with the [[flash and circle]] logo.

She also said that after an argument with Medina, he took her off the team for the 2019 Pan American Games, saying he wanted a \"young team\"; and at the World Championships that year, the equipment she was training on was deliberately maladjusted by team coaches.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarabini, Ayelen}}\n[[Category:1992 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Argentine female artistic gymnasts]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Gymnasts at the 2007 Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:Gymnasts at the 2015 Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:South American Games silver medalists for Argentina]]\n[[Category:South American Games bronze medalists for Argentina]]\n[[Category:South American Games medalists in gymnastics]]\n[[Category:Competitors at the 2006 South American Games]]\n[[Category:Competitors at the 2010 South American Games]]\n[[Category:Competitors at the 2018 South American Games]]\n", "name_user": "Natanail Llywelyn", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayel%C3%A9n_Tarabini"}

On March 27, 1814, [[United States]] forces and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies under Major General [[Andrew Jackson]]<ref>[http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/warof1812/p/battle-of-horseshoe-bend.htm Creek War: Horseshoe Bend]</ref> defeated the [[Red Sticks]], a part of the [[Creek people|Creek]] Indian tribe who opposed American expansion, effectively ending the [[Creek War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the eastern part of the [[Mississippi Territory]] had become divided into two factions: the Upper Creek (or [[Red Sticks]]), a majority who opposed American expansion and sided with the [[British Army|British]] and the colonial authorities of [[Spanish Florida]] during the War of 1812; and the Lower Creek, who were more assimilated into the [[English American|Anglo]] culture, had a stronger relationship with the U.S. [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]], and sought to remain on good terms with the Americans.\n\nThe [[Shawnee]] war leader [[Tecumseh]] visited Creek and other [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] Indian towns in 1811\u20131812 to recruit warriors to join his war against American territorial encroachment. The Red Sticks, young men who wanted to revive traditional religious and cultural practices, were already forming, resisting assimilation.  They began to raid American frontier settlements.  When the Lower Creek helped U.S. forces to capture and punish leading raiders, the Lower Creek were punished in turn by the Red Sticks.\n\nIn 1813, militia troops intercepted a Red Stick party returning from obtaining arms in (Spanish colonial) [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. While they were looting the material, the Red Sticks returned and defeated them, at what became known as the [[Battle of Burnt Corn]]. Red Sticks' raiding of enemy settlements continued; and in August 1813 they [[Fort Mims massacre|attacked]] an American outpost at [[Fort Mims]].\n\nAfter the Fort Mims massacre, frontier settlers appealed to the government for help. Since Federal military forces were committed to waging the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], the governments of [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Mississippi Territory]] organized [[Militia (United States)|militia]] forces, which together with Lower Creek and Cherokee allies, fought against the Red Sticks.\n\nAfter leaving [[Fort Williams (Alabama)|Fort Williams]] in the spring of 1814, Jackson's army cut its way through the forest to within six miles (10&nbsp;km) of Chief [[Menawa|Menawa's]] Red Stick camp ''Tehopeka'', near a bend in the [[Tallapoosa River]] called \"Horseshoe Bend\"\u2014located in what is now central [[Alabama]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of present-day [[Alexander City, Alabama|Alexander City]].

Gordon travelled through hundreds of miles of hostile Creek territory to find the British flag flying at Pensacola and British officers arming and training Creeks. Jackson, with this knowledge, took Pensacola, a controversial move which led ultimately to further battle against the British in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/captainjohngordo00wool#page/n17/mode/2up|title=\"Captain John Gordon, of the spies\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThis victory, along with that at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], greatly contributed to Jackson's favorable national reputation and his popularity.

Gordon travelled through hundreds of miles of hostile Creek territory to find the British flag flying at Pensacola and British officers arming and training Creeks. Jackson, with this knowledge, took Pensacola, a controversial move which led ultimately to further battle against the British in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/captainjohngordo00wool#page/n17/mode/2up|title=\"Captain John Gordon, of the spies\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThis victory, along with that at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], greatly contributed to Jackson's favorable national reputation and his popularity.
