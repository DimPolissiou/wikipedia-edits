Gondia municipal council was established in 1920. At that time Gondia had only 10 wards population up to 20,000 and an area of 7.5 km<sup>2</sup>. Gondia has 42 wards, as well as population nearing up to 2 lakhs. The urbanization has crossed municipal limits merging into nearby villages like Kudwa, Katangi, Fulchur, Nagra, Karanja, Murri, Pindkepar, and Khamari. The Ministry of Urban Development has recently{{when|date=June 2018}} announced to merge 20 nearby villages into Gondia to give the city status of Municipal Council. It Connected with [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] 753.\n\n==History==\nThe region is named after the [[Gondi people]], an [[Adivasi]] group in central India. It was at one point ruled by the [[Mughal Empire]].\n\nDuring [[British rule in India]], the [[Great Famine of 1876\u201378]] provided an opportunity for the construction of a {{convert|150|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} metre-gauge rail link called the [[Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway]], connecting Nagpur with Rajnandgaon. Gondia railway station was created when this line began operation in December 1888. [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]] (BNR) was formed in 1887 to upgrade and extend this line, and in 1902 BNR was contracted to provide a railway line from Gondia to Jabalpur with branches from Nainpur to Mandla as well as Nainpur to Seoni and Chhindwara. With these links and the commerce they brought, Gondia grew and prospered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/The_Roaring_Journey.pdf|title=The Roaring Journey|work=secr.indianrailways.gov.in}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\nThe city has a large number of rice mills and some small-scale tobacco industries as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Climate ==\n{{clear}}\n{{Weather box\n| location = Gondia (1981\u20132010, extremes 1946\u20132012)\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 34.5\n| Feb record high C = 38.5\n| Mar record high C = 42.5\n| Apr record high C = 46.1\n| May record high C = 47.5\n| Jun record high C = 47.5\n| Jul record high C = 44.2\n| Aug record high C = 38.4\n| Sep record high C = 39.4\n| Oct record high C = 38.0\n| Nov record high C = 35.7\n| Dec record high C = 35.1\n| year record high C = 47.5\n| Jan high C = 28.5\n| Feb high C = 31.2\n| Mar high C = 35.9\n| Apr high C = 40.3\n| May high C = 42.3\n| Jun high C = 37.9\n| Jul high C = 31.5\n| Aug high C = 30.6\n| Sep high C = 32.1\n| Oct high C = 32.6\n| Nov high C = 30.9\n| Dec high C = 28.9\n| year high C = 33.6\n| Jan low C = 13.2\n| Feb low C = 15.6\n| Mar low C = 19.9\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 27.7\n| Jun low C = 26.8\n| Jul low C = 24.1\n| Aug low C = 24.0\n| Sep low C = 23.6\n| Oct low C = 21.4\n| Nov low C = 16.6\n| Dec low C = 12.6\n| year low C = 20.8\n| Jan record low C = 6.6\n| Feb record low C = 6.7\n| Mar record low C = 11.4\n| Apr record low C = 11.6\n| May record low C = 13.8\n| Jun record low C = 20.4\n| Jul record low C = 19.8\n| Aug record low C = 18.3\n| Sep record low C = 19.2\n| Oct record low C = 13.3\n| Nov record low C = 8.5\n| Dec record low C = 5.0\n| year record low C = 5.0\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 24.3\n| Feb rain mm = 22.9\n| Mar rain mm = 13.9\n| Apr rain mm = 8.8\n| May rain mm = 10.6\n| Jun rain mm = 180.5\n| Jul rain mm = 386.1\n| Aug rain mm = 374.5\n| Sep rain mm = 177.6\n| Oct rain mm = 46.5\n| Nov rain mm = 13.6\n| Dec rain mm = 11.4\n| year rain mm = 1270.7\n| Jan rain days = 1.4\n| Feb rain days = 1.7\n| Mar rain days = 1.4\n| Apr rain days = 0.9\n| May rain days = 1.0\n| Jun rain days = 8.6\n| Jul rain days = 16.2\n| Aug rain days = 16.8\n| Sep rain days = 8.9\n| Oct rain days = 3.2\n| Nov rain days = 0.6\n| Dec rain days = 0.6\n| year rain days = 61.4\n|time day = 17:30 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| Jan humidity = 48\n| Feb humidity = 37\n| Mar humidity = 30\n| Apr humidity = 25\n| May humidity = 25\n| Jun humidity = 50\n| Jul humidity = 73\n| Aug humidity = 78\n| Sep humidity = 71\n| Oct humidity = 57\n| Nov humidity = 51\n| Dec humidity = 47\n|year humidity = 50\n|source 1 = [[India Meteorological Department]]<ref name=IMDnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205040301/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| title = Station: Gondia Climatological Table 1981\u20132010\n| work = Climatological Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = January 2015\n| pages = 293\u2013294\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=IMDextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205042509/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| title = Extremes of Temperature & Rainfall for Indian Stations (Up to 2012)\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = December 2016\n| page = M142\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Government of Maharashtra<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/BHANDARA/gen_climate.html\n| title = Climate and Seasons\n| publisher = Government of Maharashtra\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020}}</ref>\n|date = June 2012\n}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n===Road===\n[[File:Nehruchowk flyover.jpeg|thumb|Flyover in Gondia]]\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe Mumbai\u2013Nagpur\u2013Kolkata Road is the only national highway passing through the district, covering a total distance of 99.37&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi).

Gondia municipal council was established in 1920. At that time Gondia had only 10 wards population up to 20,000 and an area of 7.5 km<sup>2</sup>. Gondia has 42 wards, as well as population nearing up to 2 lakhs. The urbanization has crossed municipal limits merging into nearby villages like Kudwa, Katangi, Fulchur, Nagra, Karanja, Murri, Pindkepar, and Khamari. The Ministry of Urban Development has recently{{when|date=June 2018}} announced to merge 20 nearby villages into Gondia to give the city status of Municipal Council. It Connected with [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] 753.\n\n==History==\nThe region is named after the [[Gondi people]], an [[Adivasi]] group in central India. It was at one point ruled by the [[Mughal Empire]].\n\nDuring [[British rule in India]], the [[Great Famine of 1876\u201378]] provided an opportunity for the construction of a {{convert|150|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} metre-gauge rail link called the [[Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway]], connecting Nagpur with Rajnandgaon. Gondia railway station was created when this line began operation in December 1888. [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]] (BNR) was formed in 1887 to upgrade and extend this line, and in 1902 BNR was contracted to provide a railway line from Gondia to Jabalpur with branches from Nainpur to Mandla as well as Nainpur to Seoni and Chhindwara. With these links and the commerce they brought, Gondia grew and prospered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/The_Roaring_Journey.pdf|title=The Roaring Journey|work=secr.indianrailways.gov.in}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\nThe city has a large number of rice mills and some small-scale tobacco industries as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Climate ==\n{{clear}}\n{{Weather box\n| location = Gondia (1981\u20132010, extremes 1946\u20132012)\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 34.5\n| Feb record high C = 38.5\n| Mar record high C = 42.5\n| Apr record high C = 46.1\n| May record high C = 47.5\n| Jun record high C = 47.5\n| Jul record high C = 44.2\n| Aug record high C = 38.4\n| Sep record high C = 39.4\n| Oct record high C = 38.0\n| Nov record high C = 35.7\n| Dec record high C = 35.1\n| year record high C = 47.5\n| Jan high C = 28.5\n| Feb high C = 31.2\n| Mar high C = 35.9\n| Apr high C = 40.3\n| May high C = 42.3\n| Jun high C = 37.9\n| Jul high C = 31.5\n| Aug high C = 30.6\n| Sep high C = 32.1\n| Oct high C = 32.6\n| Nov high C = 30.9\n| Dec high C = 28.9\n| year high C = 33.6\n| Jan low C = 13.2\n| Feb low C = 15.6\n| Mar low C = 19.9\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 27.7\n| Jun low C = 26.8\n| Jul low C = 24.1\n| Aug low C = 24.0\n| Sep low C = 23.6\n| Oct low C = 21.4\n| Nov low C = 16.6\n| Dec low C = 12.6\n| year low C = 20.8\n| Jan record low C = 6.6\n| Feb record low C = 6.7\n| Mar record low C = 11.4\n| Apr record low C = 11.6\n| May record low C = 13.8\n| Jun record low C = 20.4\n| Jul record low C = 19.8\n| Aug record low C = 18.3\n| Sep record low C = 19.2\n| Oct record low C = 13.3\n| Nov record low C = 8.5\n| Dec record low C = 5.0\n| year record low C = 5.0\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 24.3\n| Feb rain mm = 22.9\n| Mar rain mm = 13.9\n| Apr rain mm = 8.8\n| May rain mm = 10.6\n| Jun rain mm = 180.5\n| Jul rain mm = 386.1\n| Aug rain mm = 374.5\n| Sep rain mm = 177.6\n| Oct rain mm = 46.5\n| Nov rain mm = 13.6\n| Dec rain mm = 11.4\n| year rain mm = 1270.7\n| Jan rain days = 1.4\n| Feb rain days = 1.7\n| Mar rain days = 1.4\n| Apr rain days = 0.9\n| May rain days = 1.0\n| Jun rain days = 8.6\n| Jul rain days = 16.2\n| Aug rain days = 16.8\n| Sep rain days = 8.9\n| Oct rain days = 3.2\n| Nov rain days = 0.6\n| Dec rain days = 0.6\n| year rain days = 61.4\n|time day = 17:30 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| Jan humidity = 48\n| Feb humidity = 37\n| Mar humidity = 30\n| Apr humidity = 25\n| May humidity = 25\n| Jun humidity = 50\n| Jul humidity = 73\n| Aug humidity = 78\n| Sep humidity = 71\n| Oct humidity = 57\n| Nov humidity = 51\n| Dec humidity = 47\n|year humidity = 50\n|source 1 = [[India Meteorological Department]]<ref name=IMDnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205040301/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| title = Station: Gondia Climatological Table 1981\u20132010\n| work = Climatological Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = January 2015\n| pages = 293\u2013294\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=IMDextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205042509/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| title = Extremes of Temperature & Rainfall for Indian Stations (Up to 2012)\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = December 2016\n| page = M142\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Government of Maharashtra<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/BHANDARA/gen_climate.html\n| title = Climate and Seasons\n| publisher = Government of Maharashtra\n| accessdate = 5 April 2020}}</ref>\n|date = June 2012\n}}\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n===Road===\n[[File:Nehruchowk flyover.jpeg|thumb|Flyover in Gondia]]\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe Mumbai\u2013Nagpur\u2013Kolkata Road is the only national highway passing through the district, covering a total distance of 99.37&nbsp;km (62&nbsp;mi).

Seesock, was a parasol wing, open cockpit four-seater, offered with a choice of engines. Its wings were rectangular in plan out to tips tapered on their [[leading edge]]s and were built around twin, solid [[spar (aeronautics)|spars]] and [[plywood]] [[rib (aeronautics)|ribs]], with [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covering]].<ref name=AeroD/> They were joined to the lower fuselage [[longerons]] by parallel pairs of [[strut]]<ref name=AeroD1/>s to the spars at about 2/3 span. These had a broad [[chord (aeronautics)|chord]], [[airfoil]] section and, with a combined area of {{cvt|35.5|sqft|m2}}, made a useful contribution to the Pacer's lift. The wing centre-section was held over the fuselage with pairs of longitudinal, vertical, inverted-V [[cabane strut]]s from the spars to the upper fuselage longerons on each side.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\nThe Pacer was designed to accept a variety of engines with outputs greater than about {{cvt|100|hp|kW}} but the first flights were made with a licence-built [[Hispano-Suiza 8]], a water-cooled [[V8 engine|V-8]] dating from 1914 developed to produce {{cvt|180|hp|kW}}. It had a \"tunnel type\" [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] mounted under the engine and a {{cvt|90|USgal|Impgal l}} fuel tank in the wing centre-section. Behind the engine the fuselage had a flat-sided, welded steel tube structure with fabric covering. The upper fuselage had a curved decking. Each wide, open cockpit seated two side-by-side; the forward cockpit, under the wing, was accessed through a door and the rear, from which it was flown, was almost under a [[trailing edge]] gently cut away to improve the upward, forward field of view and offered dual controls with a Y-type, central column. Aft, a straight-tapered, round-tipped tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a pair of parallel struts to the lower longeron on each side. The [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]] were similar in plan but with a large cut-out for rudder movement. The fin was trapezoidal in profile and its round-topped [[balanced rudder]] had a vertical trailing edge.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\nIts split-axle main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] had its steel tube axles, legs and drag struts mounted on the lower longerons. The wheels were large and the track wide. There was a short tailskid.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\n==Operational History== \n\nThe date of the first flight is not known but was well before April 1928, when some results of test flights with the Hispano engine, including a trial carrying four and their baggage, had been released.

Seesock, was a parasol wing, open cockpit four-seater, offered with a choice of engines. Its wings were rectangular in plan out to tips tapered on their [[leading edge]]s and were built around twin, solid [[spar (aeronautics)|spars]] and [[plywood]] [[rib (aeronautics)|ribs]], with [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covering]].<ref name=AeroD/> They were joined to the lower fuselage [[longerons]] by parallel pairs of [[strut]]<ref name=AeroD1/>s to the spars at about 2/3 span. These had a broad [[chord (aeronautics)|chord]], [[airfoil]] section and, with a combined area of {{cvt|35.5|sqft|m2}}, made a useful contribution to the Pacer's lift. The wing centre-section was held over the fuselage with pairs of longitudinal, vertical, inverted-V [[cabane|cabane struts]] from the spars to the upper fuselage longerons on each side.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\nThe Pacer was designed to accept a variety of engines with outputs greater than about {{cvt|100|hp|kW}} but the first flights were made with a licence-built [[Hispano-Suiza 8]], a water-cooled [[V8 engine|V-8]] dating from 1914 developed to produce {{cvt|180|hp|kW}}. It had a \"tunnel type\" [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] mounted under the engine and a {{cvt|90|USgal|Impgal l}} fuel tank in the wing centre-section. Behind the engine the fuselage had a flat-sided, welded steel tube structure with fabric covering. The upper fuselage had a curved decking. Each wide, open cockpit seated two side-by-side; the forward cockpit, under the wing, was accessed through a door and the rear, from which it was flown, was almost under a [[trailing edge]] gently cut away to improve the upward, forward field of view and offered dual controls with a Y-type, central column. Aft, a straight-tapered, round-tipped tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below with a pair of parallel struts to the lower longeron on each side. The [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]] were similar in plan but with a large cut-out for rudder movement. The fin was trapezoidal in profile and its round-topped [[balanced rudder]] had a vertical trailing edge.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\nIts split-axle main [[landing gear|undercarriage]] had its steel tube axles, legs and drag struts mounted on the lower longerons. The wheels were large and the track wide. There was a short tailskid.<ref name=AeroD/>\n\n==Operational History== \n\nThe date of the first flight is not known but was well before April 1928, when some results of test flights with the Hispano engine, including a trial carrying four and their baggage, had been released. Pacer intended production at their [[Fords, New Jersey]] factory to begin on 15 April<ref name=AeroD/> and had appointed two agencies committed to purchase production aircraft, one to cover [[New York]] and the other [[New York State]]. At the same time a Whirlwind-powered airframe was being completed for the Detroit Air Show and for flight shortly afterwords.<ref name=AeroD2/> Production continued until 1930,<ref name=GunstonMan/> though only two are known from US civil registers. One, registered in 1928, was powered by a {{cvt|220|hp|kW}} Wright J-5 Whirlwind and the other, registered in 1930, by a {{cvt|300|hp|kW}} [[Wright Whirlwind series|J-6 Whirlwind]].<ref name=AeroF/>\n\n==Specifications (Whirlwind J-5) ==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Aero Digest (April 1928)<ref name=AeroD/>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|genhide=\n\n|crew=one\n|capacity=three passengers\n|length m=\n|length ft=22\n|length in=9\n|length note=\n|span m=\n|span ft=32\n|span in=6\n|span note=\n|height m=\n|height ft=8\n|height in=7\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=200\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity={{cvt|70|USgal|Impgal l}}\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=\n|eng1 name=[[Wright Whirlwind J-5]]\n|eng1 type=9-cylinder [[radial engine|radial]]\n|eng1 hp=220\n|eng1 note=\n|power original=\n|more power=\n|prop blade number=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia ft=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia in=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=147\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=120\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=750\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=21000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|glide ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=1650\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=AeroD>{{cite magazine |editor=Horsefall, J.E.|title=The Pacer Monoplane|journal=Aero Digest|date= April 1928 |page=604 |url=\nhttps://archive.org/details/aerodigest1219unse/page/604/mode/2up|publisher=Aeronautical Digest Publishing Corp|location=New York City}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=AeroD1>{{cite magazine |title=Pacer Aircraft Corp|journal=Aero Digest|date= April 1928 |page=578 |url=\nhttps://archive.org/details/aerodigest1219unse/page/578/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=AeroD2>{{cite magazine|title=New York Air News|journal=Aero Digest|date= April 1928 |page=674 |url=\nhttps://archive.org/details/aerodigest1219unse/page/674/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=GunstonMan>{{cite book |last=Gunston |first=Bill |title=World Encyclopaedia of Aircraft Manufacturers: from the pioneers to the present day  |year=1993|publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited|location=Sparkford, Somerset|isbn=9 781852 602055|page=229}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=AeroF>{{cite web |url=http://www.aerofiles.com/_pa.html|title=Aerofiles |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n}}\n<!-- ==Further reading== -->\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n\n<!-- Navboxes go here -->\n\n\n\n[[Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft]]\n[[Category:Parasol-wing aircraft]]\n[[Category:1920s United States civil aircraft]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:cabane\u2192cabane strut,New York\u2192New York City", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacer_Monoplane"}
