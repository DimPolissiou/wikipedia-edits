Producers of the show envisioned breaking the clich\u00e9s of female characters usually portrayed on television and film. Lund was to be a driven and relentless detective without her primary concern being for her physical appearance or sexuality. Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l was involved early on in the development process of the series and had numerous discussions with writer and series creator [[S\u00f8ren Sveistrup]]. Her input was integral to the creation of the character, from keeping the character's past a mystery to the choice of clothing and especially that the character was to be emotionally isolated. At one point, the writers were considering having Lund have an affair with one of the suspects. She fought this plot line, explaining that Lund was a female [[Clint Eastwood]] and it was removed. It was originally intended that Sarah Lund should die but this was changed halfway through the series.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Stine Spjelkavik|title=Hovedrolleinnehaverne i \"Forbrytelsen\" og \"Broen\": - Er lei av kvinner som bare er til pynt|journal=Aftenposten|date=3 December 2015|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/--Er-lei-av-kvinner-som-bare-er-til-pynt-8269693.html|accessdate=7 December 2015|trans-title=Leading Actresses in The Killing and The Bridge: We are tired of women who are only for decoration|location=Oslo, Norway|language=Norwegian|postscript=A partial translation is shown on https://thekillingtimestv.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/sofia-helin-and-sofie-grabol-interview-each-other-we-were-tired-of-women-who-are-only-for-decoration/#more-3542}}</ref> Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l had become known in Denmark for playing emotional characters and the role of the cool and distant Lund was a stark departure.\n\nThe series was a huge success in Denmark with over half the population watching.

Producers of the show envisioned breaking the clich\u00e9s of female characters usually portrayed on television and film. Lund was to be a driven and relentless detective without her primary concern being for her physical appearance or sexuality. Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l was involved early on in the development process of the series and had numerous discussions with writer and series creator [[S\u00f8ren Sveistrup]]. Her input was integral to the creation of the character, from keeping the character's past a mystery to the choice of clothing and especially that the character was to be emotionally isolated. At one point, the writers were considering having Lund have an affair with one of the suspects. She fought this plot line, explaining that Lund was a female [[Clint Eastwood]] and it was removed. It was originally intended that Sarah Lund should die but this was changed halfway through the series.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Stine Spjelkavik|title=Hovedrolleinnehaverne i \"Forbrytelsen\" og \"Broen\": - Er lei av kvinner som bare er til pynt|journal=Aftenposten|date=3 December 2015|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/--Er-lei-av-kvinner-som-bare-er-til-pynt-8269693.html|accessdate=7 December 2015|trans-title=Leading Actresses in The Killing and The Bridge: We are tired of women who are only for decoration|location=Oslo, Norway|language=Norwegian|postscript=A partial translation is shown on https://thekillingtimestv.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/sofia-helin-and-sofie-grabol-interview-each-other-we-were-tired-of-women-who-are-only-for-decoration/#more-3542}}</ref> Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l had become known in Denmark for playing emotional characters and the role of the cool and distant Lund was a stark departure.\n\nThe series was a huge success in Denmark with over half the population watching.
