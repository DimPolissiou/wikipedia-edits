It serves as the principal settlement of the [[London Borough of Harrow]], lying about {{convert|10.5|mi}} northwest of [[Charing Cross]], and {{convert|5.4|mi}} south of [[Watford]]. The entire town, including its localities [[Harrow on the Hill]], [[Harrow Weald]], [[Headstone, London|Headstone]], [[North Harrow]], [[Kenton, London|Kenton]], [[Rayners Lane]], [[South Harrow]], [[Wealdstone]] and [[West Harrow]], had a population of 149,246 as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], whereas the wider borough had a population of 250,149.\n\n[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Middlesex]], Harrow was a municipal borough before it became a part of Greater London in 1965. The modern town of Harrow is what was historically called Greenhill, a former hamlet at the foot of the {{convert|408|ft|m}} Harrow Hill settlement. With the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] in the 19th century, the centre of Harrow moved to Greenhill<ref>http://patfield.com/heathfield/HeathfieldCentenary.pdf</ref> and it grew as the unofficial \"capital\" of the [[Metro-land]] suburbia.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia</ref> The historic centre of Harrow, often distinguished as [[Harrow on the Hill]], is a conservation area with [[listed building]]s of [[Georgian architecture]] and home to the famous [[Harrow School]]. The modern-day town of Harrow is an established commercial centre of outer North West London.<ref>https://www.allsop.co.uk/resources/2019/04/Next-Harrow.pdf?x89233</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nHarrow's name comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hearg'' = \"(heathen) temple\", which was probably on the hill of Harrow, where [[St Mary's Church, Harrow on the Hill|St. Mary's Church]] stands today.<ref>Room, Adrian: \"Dictionary of Place-Names in the British Isles\", Bloomsbury, 1988. {{ISBN|0-7475-0170-X}}</ref> The name has been studied in detail by [[Keith Briggs (mathematician)|Keith Briggs]].<ref>Briggs, Keith \"Harrow\", Journal of the English Place-name Society, volume 42 (2010), 43\u201364</ref>\n\nThe original Greenhill hamlet derived its name from the hollow (which has been built over from the 19th century) to the north of Harrow Hill. It was not recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] but was mentioned as early as 1334 as ''\"Grenehulle\"''. In addition, one or more families bearing the \"Greenhulle\" or \"Greenhill\" surname lived there from at least 1247, and are likely to have taken their name from this location.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref> The name \"Greenhill\" survives and the local council has continued the name by using it for \"Greenhill Way\" a road which by-passes the mainly-pedestrianised and modernised shopping area based around College Road and St Anns Road. The name is also still used for the local [[electoral ward]].\n\nIt is possible that Greenhill went by an even older name, Norbury, c. 1300, but the hamlet of Norbury has not been identified with certainty as of yet. The name may have been correspondant to [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], being north of what was then Harrow Hill.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Harrow on the Hill}}\n[[File:Headstone Manor,exterior view.jpg|thumb|Grade I listed [[Headstone Manor]]]]\nHarrow, formerly known as Greenhill, was a small [[hamlet]] of farms at the foot of Harrow Hill. For almost a millenium, the centre of Harrow was atop the hill, but this started to change in the 19th century. Circa 1852, the village had 8 houses, 17 cottages, and one inn, with 141 people.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref>\n\n===Urban development===\n[[File:Church of St John the Baptist Greenhill 1C.png|thumb|200px|left|Grade II listed St John's Greenhill church originally served the hamlet of Greenhill - parts of the original building were demolished in 1905; today it is located in town on Sheepcote Road<ref>https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/e2967a12-7d54-467c-acea-026f01768778</ref>]]\nBy 1865, a series of roads had been built in Greenhill, including College, Roxborough, Kymberley, Headstone, Clarendon, Byron and St Anns - but few houses.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref> A [[parish]] church, St John's Church, was built in 1866 on a farm and Greenhill became a separate parish in 1896.

The modern town of Harrow is what was historically called Greenhill, a former hamlet at the foot of the {{convert|408|ft|m}} Harrow Hill settlement. With the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Railway]] in the 19th century, the centre of Harrow moved to Greenhill<ref>http://patfield.com/heathfield/HeathfieldCentenary.pdf</ref> and it grew as the unofficial \"capital\" of the [[Metro-land]] suburbia.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/10/metroland-100-years-england-original-vision-suburbia</ref> The historic centre of Harrow, often distinguished as [[Harrow on the Hill]], is a conservation area with [[listed building]]s of [[Georgian architecture]] and home to the famous [[Harrow School]]. The modern-day town of Harrow is an established commercial centre of outer North West London.<ref>https://www.allsop.co.uk/resources/2019/04/Next-Harrow.pdf?x89233</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nHarrow's name comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hearg'' = \"(heathen) temple\", which was probably on the hill of Harrow, where [[St Mary's Church, Harrow on the Hill|St. Mary's Church]] stands today.<ref>Room, Adrian: \"Dictionary of Place-Names in the British Isles\", Bloomsbury, 1988. {{ISBN|0-7475-0170-X}}</ref> The name has been studied in detail by [[Keith Briggs (mathematician)|Keith Briggs]].<ref>Briggs, Keith \"Harrow\", Journal of the English Place-name Society, volume 42 (2010), 43\u201364</ref>\n\nThe original Greenhill hamlet derived its name from the hollow (which has been built over from the 19th century) to the north of Harrow Hill. It was not recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] but was mentioned as early as 1334 as ''\"Grenehulle\"''. In addition, one or more families bearing the \"Greenhulle\" or \"Greenhill\" surname lived there from at least 1247, and are likely to have taken their name from this location.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref> The name \"Greenhill\" survives and the local council has continued the name by using it for \"Greenhill Way\" a road which by-passes the mainly-pedestrianised and modernised shopping area based around College Road and St Anns Road. The name is also still used for the local [[electoral ward]].\n\nIt is possible that Greenhill went by an even older name, Norbury, c. 1300, but the hamlet of Norbury has not been identified with certainty as of yet. The name may have been correspondant to [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], being north of what was then Harrow Hill.<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol4/pp172-198</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Harrow on the Hill}}\n[[File:Headstone Manor,exterior view.jpg|thumb|Grade I listed [[Headstone Manor]]]]\nHarrow, formerly known as Greenhill, was a small [[hamlet]] of farms at the foot of Harrow Hill.

She joined [[Binibining Pilipinas 2010]] (Miss Philippines) and won [[Binibining Pilipinas 2010|Binibining Pilipinas-International 2010]] (Miss Philippines International). She represented the Philippines in [[Miss International 2010]] wherein she placed in the Top 15 finalists.\n\n==Background==\n\nShe was born in [[Orange County, California]], and is of Filipino, English, German, Spanish, Scottish, Finnish and Chinese descent.  Spending four years in the Philippines hosting, acting, and performing on a number of primetime television shows, she ventured out to other parts of Southeast Asia. She went on to win Binibining Pilipinas (Miss Philippines) in 2010, also bagging the titles Best in Swimsuit and Best in Talent.  Upon auditioning for the man himself, Krista was mentored by world-renowned international balladeer Julio Iglesias after being asked to be his special guest on his world tour in 2010.  Krista self produced a pop/dance/R&B album after returning to the Philippines, leading to her signing two major label deals (with Universal Records and Warner Music Group) across four countries in Asia\u2014the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.  Shortly after, Krista connected with Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas, who became her mentor, eventually leading to her return to Los Angeles.\n\nSince returning to Los Angeles, Krista has become involved with a nonprofit called Club 42 (founded by John Branca and supported by the Michael Jackson estate) and has helped with the development of business technology firm JMAS Group.  She has worked with a number of production companies including Mike Judge's Tales from the Tour Bus TV show, Language Media, Shorebreak International Inc. and Execution Style Entertainment. Since the age of 4, Krista Kleiner has been performing both on and off the stage.  Having enrolled in jazz, tap, hip-hop, ballroom, and ballet classes at such a young age, Krista soon found herself successfully competing in Latin ballroom styles (Pasodoble, Cha Cha, Rumba, Samba, and Jive). Later, she became a runway model. Kleiner started to slowly learn the ropes of the entertainment industry that she would soon call home.\n\nAt 18, she secured her first major contract with the top TV network in the Philippines.  Having just begun her college education at the University of California in San Diego, the difficult choice between an education in the classroom or an education in the real world would present itself.  Kleiner would uproot herself from California for an experience that was supposed to last but only a few months, but in fact lasted four years.\n\nOver the course of her years in the Philippines, Kleiner co-hosted a primetime game show out of the gate.  Her unique look and playful personality mixed with her uncanny ability to speak the native Tagalog language made her an instant hit with the Filipino audiences.  This instant connection with her Philippine fans catapulted her to her next gig\u2014a lead role in the primetime equivalent of Spiderman in the Philippines.  Through this role she was able to display a new comedic side to her character as well as her ability to perform in action sequences by leveraging her black belt in Tae Know Do (along with highly dangerous nun chuck skills that she would take with her on another show Darna [Wonderwoman in the Philippines]).  Her rising star power didn\u2019t stop there.  Successful showings while hosting lifestyle shows, daytime shows, and the number one variety show in the Philippines turned one-off spots into regular appearances, which continued to bring her into the hearts and minds of her loyal Philippine fans.\n\nTruly immersing and assimilating herself into the Philippine culture created a sense of pride in her country that she could not ignore.  That pride turned into a sense of obligation to be the best representative of a beautiful Filipino culture, so she joined the Binibining Pilipinas competition in 2010 (Miss Philippines).  She was fortunate enough to qualify to compete and not only took awards for \u201cBest in Swim Suit\u201d and \u201cBest in Talent\u201d but also took home the crown as Miss Philippines International 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Krista Kleiner is among top 15 beauties for global society|url=http://www.bbpilipinas.com/sub.php?c=p&b=WorldTop15|publisher=Bb.

She was personally asked by Julio to join him on his world tour as a special guest performer that would sing and dance before sell-out crowds in the Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, and even back in her own native United States.  The wealth of knowledge and experience she learned training with one of the best in the music business had turned a light switch on forever.  She had found her true passion in musical performance and writing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Balladeer Julio Iglesias invites RP beauty titlist Krista Kleiner to his world tour|url=http://videos.gmanews.tv/2010a/03/chikamin_032310_kri.flv|publisher=GMA News}}</ref>\n\nBeing no stranger to taking dreams into her own hands, Krista self-produced her debut album entitled Feels So Good.   As if spearheading her own 14-track album wasn\u2019t enough, she represented herself to labels and successfully locked in multiple distribution deals for her project (Universal Records in the Philippines and Warner Music Group in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krista Kleiner releases her debut album, Feels So

an American Eurasian entertainer, creator and beauty queen. She joined [[Binibining Pilipinas 2010]] (Miss Philippines) and won [[Binibining Pilipinas 2010|Binibining Pilipinas-International 2010]] (Miss Philippines International). She represented the Philippines in [[Miss International 2010]] wherein she placed in the Top 15 finalists.\n\n==Background==\n\nShe is of Filipino, English, German, Spanish, Scottish, Finnish and Chinese descent.  Spending four years in the Philippines hosting, acting, and performing on a number of primetime television shows, she ventured out to other parts of Southeast Asia. She went on to win Binibining Pilipinas (Miss Philippines) in 2010, also bagging the titles Best in Swimsuit and Best in Talent.  Upon auditioning for the man himself, Krista was mentored by world-renowned international balladeer Julio Iglesias after being asked to be his special guest on his world tour in 2010.  Krista self produced a pop/dance/R&B album after returning to the Philippines, leading to her signing two major label deals (with Universal Records and Warner Music Group) across four countries in Asia\u2014the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei.  Shortly after, Krista connected with Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas, who became her mentor, eventually leading to her return to Los Angeles.\n\nSince returning to Los Angeles, Krista has become involved with a nonprofit called Club 42 (founded by John Branca and supported by the Michael Jackson estate) and has helped with the development of business technology firm JMAS Group.  She has worked with a number of production companies including Mike Judge's Tales from the Tour Bus TV show, Language Media, Shorebreak International Inc. and Execution Style Entertainment. Since the age of 4, Krista Kleiner has been performing both on and off the stage.  Having enrolled in jazz, tap, hip-hop, ballroom, and ballet classes at such a young age, Krista soon found herself successfully competing in Latin ballroom styles (Pasodoble, Cha Cha, Rumba, Samba, and Jive). Later, she became a runway model. Kleiner started to slowly learn the ropes of the entertainment industry that she would soon call home.\n\nAt 18, she secured her first major contract with the top TV network in the Philippines.  Having just begun her college education at the University of California in San Diego, the difficult choice between an education in the classroom or an education in the real world would present itself.  Kleiner would uproot herself from California for an experience that was supposed to last but only a few months, but in fact lasted four years.\n\nOver the course of her years in the Philippines, Kleiner co-hosted a primetime game show out of the gate.  Her unique look and playful personality mixed with her uncanny ability to speak the native Tagalog language made her an instant hit with the Filipino audiences.  This instant connection with her Philippine fans catapulted her to her next gig\u2014a lead role in the primetime equivalent of Spiderman in the Philippines.  Through this role she was able to display a new comedic side to her character as well as her ability to perform in action sequences by leveraging her black belt in Tae Know Do (along with highly dangerous nun chuck skills that she would take with her on another show Darna [Wonderwoman in the Philippines]).  Her rising star power didn\u2019t stop there.  Successful showings while hosting lifestyle shows, daytime shows, and the number one variety show in the Philippines turned one-off spots into regular appearances, which continued to bring her into the hearts and minds of her loyal Philippine fans.\n\nTruly immersing and assimilating herself into the Philippine culture created a sense of pride in her country that she could not ignore.  That pride turned into a sense of obligation to be the best representative of a beautiful Filipino culture, so she joined the Binibining Pilipinas competition in 2010 (Miss Philippines).  She was fortunate enough to qualify to compete and not only took awards for \u201cBest in Swim Suit\u201d and \u201cBest in Talent\u201d but also took home the crown as Miss Philippines International 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Krista Kleiner is among top 15 beauties for global society|url=http://www.bbpilipinas.com/sub.php?c=p&b=WorldTop15|publisher=Bb.

She was personally asked by Julio to join him on his world tour as a special guest performer that would sing and dance before sell-out crowds in the Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, and even back in her own native United States.  The wealth of knowledge and experience she learned training with one of the best in the music business had turned a light switch on forever.  She had found her true passion in musical performance and writing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Balladeer Julio Iglesias invites RP beauty titlist Krista Kleiner to his world tour|url=http://videos.gmanews.tv/2010a/03/chikamin_032310_kri.flv|publisher=GMA News}}</ref>\n\nBeing no stranger to taking dreams into her own hands, Krista self-produced her debut album entitled Feels So Good.   As if spearheading her own 14-track album wasn\u2019t enough, she represented herself to labels and successfully locked in multiple distribution deals for her project (Universal Records in the Philippines and Warner Music Group in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krista Kleiner releases her debut album, Feels So

Two years later, Winchester tragically lost his father in a vehicle accident. However, Shahdon later explained that the event helped him develop a deeper motivation to pursue a [[professional]] football career. After her husband's death, Svetlana made it her responsibility to ensure that Shahdon was not denied the opportunity to pursue his football dreams. In fact, she decided to take driving classes and apply for a permit to be able to drive Shahdon to youth practice in [[Couva]].<ref name=\"parents\" />\n\nAt the age of 12, Winchester made his debut for [[Naparima College]] in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], Trinidad.
