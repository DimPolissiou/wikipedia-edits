He was [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] for three periods, 1945\u20131951, 1955\u20131963 and 1963\u20131965. With 17 years in office, he is the longest serving Prime Minister in Norway since the introduction of [[parliamentarism]]. Many Norwegians often refer to him as [[Father of the Nation|\"Landsfaderen\" (Father of the Nation)]]; he is generally considered one of the main architects of the rebuilding of Norway after World War II. He also served as the second President of the [[Nordic Council]] in 1954.\n\n==Early life==\nEinar Gerhardsen was born in the municipality of [[Asker]], in the county of [[Akershus]]. His parents were Gerhard Olsen (1867\u20131949) and Emma Hansen (1872\u20131949).

He was convicted several times of taking part in subversive activities until he, along with the rest of the Labour party, gradually moved from [[communism]] to [[democratic socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} He participated in the [[Left Communist Youth League]]'s [[military strike action]] of 1924.

Gerhardsen was elected to Oslo city council in 1932 and became deputy mayor in 1938. He was deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1939.\n\nAfter the German occupation of Norway in 1940, Gerhardsen became acting chairman of the Labour Party, as the chairman, [[Oscar Torp]] had gone into exile. Gerhardsen became mayor of Oslo on 15 August 1940, but was forced to resign by the Germans on 26 August the same year. In September, the occupation government banned all parliamentary political parties, including the Labour party.\n\nDuring World War II, Gerhardsen took part in the organised resistance against the [[German occupation of Norway]], and was arrested on 11 September 1941. Having already been under suspicion for a long time, Gerhardsen had been detained and subjected to interrogations on 31 previous occasions since the summer of 1940. Initially he was sent to [[Grini concentration camp]] in Norway. In February 1942 he was accused of leading resistance work from his imprisonment, and removed from the camp for interrogation. Initially interrogated at the police station at [[M\u00f8llergata 19]], he was soon transferred to the [[Gestapo]] headquarters at [[Victoria Terrasse]]. At Victoria Terrasse he was tortured to reveal information on the resistance, but did not break. In April 1942 he was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in Germany. In September 1944 he was transferred back to Grini, where he spent the rest of the war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Einar Gerhardsen: en politisk biografi |last=Olstad |first=Finn |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |isbn=8200128288 |pages=158\u2013176 |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010052503018 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Gerhardsen formed the interim government which sat from the end of the occupation in May 1945 until the elections held in October the same year. The elections gave Labour an absolute majority in Parliament, the [[Stortinget|Storting]], which it retained until 1961. Gerhardsen served as [[President of the Storting]] from 10 January 1954 to 22 January 1955.\n\n==Domestic and Foreign Policy from 1945==\n[[File:Einar Gerhardsen (131919).jpg|thumb|Gerhardsen at a political rally in [[Bergen]] in the late 1960s]]\nDuring and after his periods in office he was greatly respected by the people, even those not sharing his social democratic views. The administrations he led forged an eclectic economic policy in which government regulation of commerce, industry and banking was combined with market economics. Abject poverty and unemployment were sharply reduced by his government's policies of [[industrialisation]] and redistribution of wealth through [[progressive taxation]], together with the creation of a comprehensive social security system.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=47Yp1TJgUz0C&pg=PA217&dq=Einar+Gerhardsen+introduced+welfare+state&hl=en&ei=iim7TZzUIcnA8QPu3LnFBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Einar%20Gerhardsen%20introduced%20welfare%20state&f=false]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223231831/https://books.google.com/books?id=47Yp1TJgUz0C&pg=PA217&dq=Einar+Gerhardsen+introduced+welfare+state&hl=en&ei=iim7TZzUIcnA8QPu3LnFBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Einar%20Gerhardsen%20introduced%20welfare%20state&f=false |date=December 23, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian State Housing Bank Law of March 1946 introduced relatively cheap loans for cooperative housing societies and individual private builders. The Child Allowances Law of October 1946 introduced allowances for second and subsequent children under the age of 16, while also providing allowances for single-parent families for the first child. Under a July 1947 law, unemployment insurance coverage was extended to agricultural workers and certain other groups.

Documents from 1958 reveal that the Gerhardsen's government knew that Israel was going to use heavy water supplied by [[Noratom]] for plutonium production, making it possible for Israel to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn November 1962 an accident in which 21 miners died occurred in the [[Kings Bay Affair|Kings Bay]] coal mine on [[Spitsbergen]] in the [[Svalbard]] archipelago. In the aftermath, the Gerhardsen government was accused of not complying with laws enacted by  parliament. In the summer of 1963 a vote of no confidence passed with the support of the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]] and a centre-right minority coalition government was formed, under [[John Lyng]].

He was [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] for three periods, 1945\u20131951, 1955\u20131963 and 1963\u20131965. With 17 years in office, he is the longest serving Prime Minister in Norway since the introduction of [[parliamentarism]]. Many Norwegians often refer to him as [[Father of the Nation|\"Landsfaderen\" (Father of the Nation)]]; he is generally considered one of the main architects of the rebuilding of Norway after World War II. He also served as the second President of the [[Nordic Council]] in 1954.\n\n==Early life==\nEinar Gerhardsen was born in the municipality of [[Asker]], in the county of [[Akershus]]. His parents were Gerhard Olsen (1867\u20131949) and Emma Hansen (1872\u20131949).

He was convicted several times of taking part in subversive activities until he, along with the rest of the Labour party, gradually moved from [[communism]] to [[democratic socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} He participated in the [[Left Communist Youth League]]'s [[military strike action]] of 1924.

Gerhardsen was elected to Oslo city council in 1932 and became deputy mayor in 1938. He was deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1939.\n\nAfter the German occupation of Norway in 1940, Gerhardsen became acting chairman of the Labour Party, as the chairman, [[Oscar Torp]] had gone into exile. Gerhardsen became mayor of Oslo on 15 August 1940, but was forced to resign by the Germans on 26 August the same year. In September, the occupation government banned all parliamentary political parties, including the Labour party.\n\nDuring World War II, Gerhardsen took part in the organised resistance against the [[German occupation of Norway]], and was arrested on 11 September 1941. Having already been under suspicion for a long time, Gerhardsen had been detained and subjected to interrogations on 31 previous occasions since the summer of 1940. Initially he was sent to [[Grini concentration camp]] in Norway. In February 1942 he was accused of leading resistance work from his imprisonment, and removed from the camp for interrogation. Initially interrogated at the police station at [[M\u00f8llergata 19]], he was soon transferred to the [[Gestapo]] headquarters at [[Victoria Terrasse]]. At Victoria Terrasse he was tortured to reveal information on the resistance, but did not break. In April 1942 he was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in Germany. In September 1944 he was transferred back to Grini, where he spent the rest of the war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Einar Gerhardsen: en politisk biografi |last=Olstad |first=Finn |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |isbn=8200128288 |pages=158\u2013176 |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010052503018 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Gerhardsen formed the interim government which sat from the end of the occupation in May 1945 until the elections held in October the same year. The elections gave Labour an absolute majority in Parliament, the [[Stortinget|Storting]], which it retained until 1961. Gerhardsen served as [[President of the Storting]] from 10 January 1954 to 22 January 1955.\n\n==Domestic and Foreign Policy from 1945==\n[[File:Einar Gerhardsen (131919).jpg|thumb|Gerhardsen at a political rally in [[Bergen]] in the late 1960s]]\nDuring and after his periods in office he was greatly respected by the people, even those not sharing his social democratic views. The administrations he led forged an eclectic economic policy in which government regulation of commerce, industry and banking was combined with market economics. Abject poverty and unemployment were sharply reduced by his government's policies of [[industrialisation]] and redistribution of wealth through [[progressive taxation]], together with the creation of a comprehensive social security system.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=47Yp1TJgUz0C&pg=PA217&dq=Einar+Gerhardsen+introduced+welfare+state&hl=en&ei=iim7TZzUIcnA8QPu3LnFBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Einar%20Gerhardsen%20introduced%20welfare%20state&f=false]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223231831/https://books.google.com/books?id=47Yp1TJgUz0C&pg=PA217&dq=Einar+Gerhardsen+introduced+welfare+state&hl=en&ei=iim7TZzUIcnA8QPu3LnFBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Einar%20Gerhardsen%20introduced%20welfare%20state&f=false |date=December 23, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Norwegian State Housing Bank Law of March 1946 introduced relatively cheap loans for cooperative housing societies and individual private builders. The Child Allowances Law of October 1946 introduced allowances for second and subsequent children under the age of 16, while also providing allowances for single-parent families for the first child. Under a July 1947 law, unemployment insurance coverage was extended to agricultural workers and certain other groups.

In the aftermath, the Gerhardsen government was accused of not complying with laws enacted by  parliament. In the summer of 1963 a vote of no confidence passed with the support of the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist People's Party]] and a centre-right minority coalition government was formed, under [[John Lyng]].

Tambo''', was a [[South Africa]]n anti-[[apartheid]] [[politician]] and revolutionary who served as [[President (corporate title)|President]] of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) from 1967 to 1991.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nTambo was born on (27 October 1917)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sanews.gov.za/special-features-archive/or-tambo-centenary|title=OR Tambo Centary|website=sanews.gov.za}}</ref> in the village of [[Nkantolo]] in [[Bizana, Eastern Cape|Bizana]]; eastern [[Pondoland]] in what is now the [[Eastern Cape]]. The village Tambo was born in was made up mostly of farmers.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} His father, Mzimeni Tambo, was the son of a farmer and an assistant salesperson at a local trading store. Mzimeni had four wives and ten children, all of whom were [[illiterate]]. Oliver's mother, Mzimeni's third wife, was called Julia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oliver Reginald Kaizana Tambo|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/oliver-reginald-kaizana-tambo|publisher=South African History Online}}</ref> \n\nTambo came from a stable family in which his father's children had to have a good education. He attended [[Anglican]] and [[Methodist]] missionary schools, including Holy Cross missionary school with his brother in April 1928. After five years at the Holy Cross, Tambo excelled in his studies and transferred to [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)|St. Peter's]] in [[Johannesburg]]. \n \n\nTambo graduated in 1938 as one of the top students.  After this, Tambo was admitted to the [[University of Fort Hare]] but in 1940 he, along with several others including [[Nelson Mandela]], was expelled for participating in a student strike. In 1942, Tambo returned to his former high school in Johannesburg to teach [[Natural science|science]] and [[mathematics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===League===\nIn 1943, Tambo, Mandela and [[Walter Sisulu]] founded the [[ANC Youth League]], with Tambo becoming its first National Secretary and a member of the National Executive in 1948. The Youth League proposed a change in the tactics of the anti-apartheid movement. Previously, the ANC had sought to further its cause by actions such as [[petition]]s and demonstrations; the Youth League felt these actions were insufficient to achieve the group's goals and proposed their own \"Programme of Action\". This programme advocated tactics such as [[boycott]]s, [[civil disobedience]], [[strike action|strikes]], and non-collaboration. \n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-T0515-008, Berlin, Besuch ANC-Delegation, Axen, Tambo.jpg|thumb|Tambo being greeted on arrival in East Germany (1978)]]\n\nIn 1955, Tambo became Secretary-general of the ANC after Sisulu was banned by the South African government under the [[Suppression of Communism Act]]. In 1958, he became Deputy President of the ANC and in 1959 was served with a five-year banning order by the government.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Exile in London===\nIn response, Tambo was sent abroad by the ANC to mobilise opposition to apartheid. He settled with his family in [[Muswell Hill]], north [[London]], where he lived until 1990. His exile took a toll on him seeing his wife and three children, but his wife Adelaide supported the ANC at home by taking in ANC members arriving in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/oliver-tambo-the-exile-394806.html Oliver Tambo: the exile], ''[[The Independent]]'', 15 October 2007.</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Tambo became Acting President of the ANC, following the death of Chief [[Albert Lutuli]]. He sought to keep the ANC together even after he was exiled from South Africa. Due to his skillful lobbying, he was able to attract talented South African exiles, one of them being [[Thabo Mbeki]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOn 30 December 1979 in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], Tambo as President and [[Alfred Nzo]], then Secretary-general of the ANC, met [[Tim Jenkin]], [[Stephen Lee (South African activist)|Stephen Lee]] and [[Alex Moumbaris]], ANC members and escapees from incarceration at [[Phillip kgosi prison]] as political prisoners.

It claimed that 11 of the casualties were [[South African Defence Force|SADF]] personnel and hence a military target. The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as they were administrative staff, including telephonists and typists, they could not be considered a legitimate military target.\n\nTen MK operatives, including Ismail, applied for amnesty for this and other bombings. The applications were opposed on various grounds, including that it was a terrorist attack disproportionate to the political motive. The TRC found that the number of civilians versus military personnel killed was unclear. South African Police statistics indicated that seven members of the SADF were killed.

Mandela, [[Thabo Mbeki]] and Walter Sisulu attended the funeral. Tambo was buried in [[Benoni, Gauteng]].\n\n==International relationships==\n\nThe strong fight against apartheid brought Tambo to form a series of intense international relationships.\nIn 1977, Tambo signed the first solidarity agreement between the ANC and a municipality: the Italian town of [[Reggio Emilia]] was the first city in the world to sign such a pact of solidarity.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=10 Years of Freedom: South Africa and Italy Co-Celebrate the Victory over Nazi-Fascism and the Victory over Apartheid|url=http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2004/free0428.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> This was the beginning of a long understanding which brought Italy to put an effort into concrete actions to support the right of southern African people's self-determination; one of these actions was the organization of solidarity ships.

The decision to cancel the results was largely informed by the fact that the majority of blacks South Africans did not participate in the voting, as SABC3 caters predominantly to English speakers.\n\nIn late 2005, ANC politicians announced plans to rename [[Johannesburg International Airport]] after him. The proposal was accepted and the renaming ceremony occurred on 27 October 2006. The ANC-dominated government had previously renamed [[Jan Smuts]] Airport as [[Johannesburg International Airport]] in 1994 on the grounds that South African airports should not be named after political figures.\n\nThere is a bust of O.R. Tambo at the Albert Road Recreation Ground, Muswell Hill, outside the [[Alexandra Park School]]. In June 2013, the city of Reggio Emilia (Italy) celebrated Tambo with the creation of a park dedicated to the President of the African National Congress.\n\nHis house at 51 Alexandra Park Road, Muswell Hill, London, was purchased by the South African Government in 2010 as an historic monument and now bears a plaque.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7429566/South-African-government-buys-ANC-leaders-Muswell-Hill-home.html|title=South African government buys ANC leader's Muswell Hill home|last=Berger|first=Sebastien|date=12 March 2010|accessdate=4 August 2018|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7049332.stm|title=Memorials to South African leader|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nTambo's grave was declared a National Heritage site when he died but lost this status when his wife, [[Adelaide Tambo]], died and was buried alongside him.

The event was curated by Ambassador Lindiwe Mabuza and Fr Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu, together with the Thabo Mbeki Foundation and the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation.

Mandela, [[Thabo Mbeki]] and Walter Sisulu attended the funeral. Tambo was buried in [[Benoni, Gauteng]].\n\n==International relationships==\n\nThe strong fight against apartheid brought Tambo to form a series of intense international relationships.\nIn 1977, Tambo signed the first solidarity agreement between the ANC and a municipality: the Italian town of [[Reggio Emilia]] was the first city in the world to sign such a pact of solidarity.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=10 Years of Freedom: South Africa and Italy Co-Celebrate the Victory over Nazi-Fascism and the Victory over Apartheid|url=http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2004/free0428.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> This was the beginning of a long understanding which brought Italy to put an effort into concrete actions to support the right of southern African people's self-determination; one of these actions was the organization of solidarity ships.

F. Verwoerd]], before the [[SABC]] decided to cancel the final rounds of voting.  The decision to cancel the results was largely informed by the fact that the majority of blacks South Africans did not participate in the voting, as SABC3 caters predominantly to English speakers.\n\nIn late 2005, ANC politicians announced plans to rename [[Johannesburg International Airport]] after him. The proposal was accepted and the renaming ceremony occurred on 27 October 2006. The ANC-dominated government had previously renamed [[Jan Smuts]] Airport as [[Johannesburg International Airport]] in 1994 on the grounds that South African airports should not be named after political figures.\n\nThere is a bust of O.R. Tambo at the Albert Road Recreation Ground, Muswell Hill, outside the [[Alexandra Park School]]. In June 2013, the city of Reggio Emilia (Italy) celebrated Tambo with the creation of a park dedicated to the President of the African National Congress.\n\nHis house at 51 Alexandra Park Road, Muswell Hill, London, was purchased by the South African Government in 2010 as an historic monument and now bears a plaque.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7429566/South-African-government-buys-ANC-leaders-Muswell-Hill-home.html|title=South African government buys ANC leader's Muswell Hill home|last=Berger|first=Sebastien|date=12 March 2010|accessdate=4 August 2018|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7049332.stm|title=Memorials to South African leader|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nTambo's grave was declared a National Heritage site when he died but lost this status when his wife, [[Adelaide Tambo]], died and was buried alongside him.

This same event marked also the centenary of the sinking of the troopship [[SS Mendi|SS ''Mendi'']]. The event was curated by Ambassador Lindiwe Mabuza and Fr Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu, together with the Thabo Mbeki Foundation and the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation. Participating choirs were the Imilonji kaNtu Choral Society, Johannesburg Metro Police Choir and Ekurhuleni Metro Police Choir.

In 1956, the pageant was officially restarted after crowning models from 1952 until 1955. In 1956, Olga Fiallo from [[Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)|Santiago]] won, making the Dominican Republic's first representative to Miss Universe. In 1966, the Concurso Nacional de Belleza Dominicana lost its Miss Universe rights for only one year but on that same year it gained their Miss World franchise sending the winner of that year, Jeanette Dotel from [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan]] as their first representative. In 1967, the organization officially decided that the Winner would go to Miss Universe, First Runner-up would enter Miss World and Second Runner-up to a Festival of Latin Beauties in South America. The MRD organization had acquired the Miss International rights, but the organization would only send a representative if the budget allowed them. It wasn't until 1980, when they decided that the Second Runner-up would enter either in Miss International, Reinado Nacional del Caf\u00e9 or Miss Am\u00e9rica Latina. In 1989 until 2000, the official Second Runner-up would enter Miss International, the Third Runner-up would enter Reinado Nacional del Caf\u00e9 and the Fourth Runner-up would enter Miss Am\u00e9rica Latina. This has been the same until 2003 when the organization separated into two separate organizations.\n \n===Miss Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Universo Organization===\nThe Miss Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Universo Organization was created in 2003 by Belkys Reyes, and was taken over by [[Magali Febles]] in 2004. Since 2003, the representatives of Dominican Republic for one out of the four major international pageants have been selected by this organization. This organization is in charge of sending representatives to [[Miss Universe]]. Miss Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Universo competes in [[Miss Universe]]. Also, this organization has 15 franchises in other international competitions and sends representatives to these competitions every year such as [[Reina Hispanoamericana]] and [[Miss Continentes Unidos]].<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151832909963984&set=gm.577997372262119&type=1&theater Concurso Nacional de Belleza de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana coronara Grand Slams y 9 otras franquicias ]{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Reina Nacional de Belleza Dominicana Organization===\nThe organization of Reina Nacional de Belleza Dominicana was created in 2003 by Diany Mota, and is still run by her today.

In 1956, the pageant was officially restarted after crowning models from 1952 until 1955. In 1956, Olga Fiallo from [[Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)|Santiago]] won, making the Dominican Republic's first representative to Miss Universe. In 1966, the Concurso Nacional de Belleza Dominicana lost its Miss Universe rights for only one year but on that same year it gained their Miss World franchise sending the winner of that year, Jeanette Dotel from [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan]] as their first representative. In 1967, the organization officially decided that the Winner would go to Miss Universe, First Runner-up would enter Miss World and Second Runner-up to a Festival of Latin Beauties in South America. The MRD organization had acquired the Miss International rights, but the organization would only send a representative if the budget allowed them. It wasn't until 1980, when they decided that the Second Runner-up would enter either in Miss International, Reinado Nacional del Caf\u00e9 or Miss Am\u00e9rica Latina. In 1989 until 2000, the official Second Runner-up would enter Miss International, the Third Runner-up would enter Reinado Nacional del Caf\u00e9 and the Fourth Runner-up would enter Miss Am\u00e9rica Latina. This has been the same until 2003 when the organization separated into two separate organizations.\n \n===Miss Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Universo Organization===\nThe Miss Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Universo Organization was created in 2003 by Belkys Reyes, and was taken over by [[Magali Febles]] in 2004. Since 2003, the representatives of Dominican Republic for one out of the four major international pageants have been selected by this organization. This organization is in charge of sending representatives to [[Miss Universe]]. Miss Rep\u00fablica Dominicana Universo competes in [[Miss Universe]]. Also, this organization has 15 franchises in other international competitions and sends representatives to these competitions every year such as [[Reina Hispanoamericana]] and [[Miss Continentes Unidos]].<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151832909963984&set=gm.577997372262119&type=1&theater Concurso Nacional de Belleza de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana coronara Grand Slams y 9 otras franquicias ]{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Reina Nacional de Belleza Dominicana Organization===\nThe organization of Reina Nacional de Belleza Dominicana was created in 2003 by Diany Mota, and is still run by her today.
