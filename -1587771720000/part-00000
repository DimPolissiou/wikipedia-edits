She also gave painting classes in Whitby.<ref name=\":1\" /> She became an instructor and a critic at an all boys\u2019 school in Pickering College and an assistant art instructor at the Ontario's Ladies\u2019 College in the 1900s and later, the head of the art department.<ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/whitby/43070/data|title=Florence Helena McGillivray, 1906|website=images.ourontario.ca}}</ref> \n\nThe artist also helped encourage fellow Canadian artist [[Tom Thomson]], who was praised for his landscape paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1913 during her trip in Paris, her instructors  at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re|Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] were Lucien Simon and \u00c9mile-Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nard. But her real inspiration was the artist Frederic Fiebig<ref> Allen, pp. 74-75</ref> and due to him, she began to work in a style new to her that involved using the palette knife and a heavier application of paint. Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member (1925). <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" />\n\n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H.

Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* {{Cite book|last=Allen |first=W C.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1090427835|title=She is one of the best : a researcher's notes on the life and times of canadian artist Florence...

One of the most famous groups that she was associated with was the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. Her art works expresses a view of landscape in bold colours that would be categorized later on as part of the Group of Seven landscape painting that captures the two visions of the land: the romantic-realist view of the railway artists of the 1880s and the heroic view of the landscape in the 1890s.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nShe joined the Womens Art Association of Canada where she studied painting on china with Mary E. Dignam, its founding president.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray was welcomed into communities and numerous social affairs which included the Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Women Painters and Sculptors Art Club (Women Painters and Sculptors 1917) which were both centralized in New York City.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She continued her study of painting on china  with Marshall Fry in New York in 1898 and sold her pieces later from her studio in Whitby <ref name=\":1\" />. She also gave painting classes in Whitby.<ref name=\":1\" /> She became an instructor and a critic at an all boys\u2019 school in Pickering College and an assistant art instructor at the Ontario's Ladies\u2019 College in the 1900s and later, the head of the art department.<ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/whitby/43070/data|title=Florence Helena McGillivray, 1906|website=images.ourontario.ca}}</ref> \n\nThe artist also helped encourage fellow Canadian artist [[Tom Thomson]], who was praised for his landscape paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1913 during her trip in Paris, her instructors  at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re|Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] were Lucien Simon and Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nard. But her real inspiration was the artist Frederic Fiebig<ref> Allen, pp. 74-75</ref> and due to him, she began to work in a style new to her that involved using the palette knife and a heavier application of paint. Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member (1925). <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" />\n\n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray.jpg|thumb|St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray Canadian, 1864 - 1938 oil on canvas 46.7 x 61.6&nbsp;cm Purchased 1926 National Gallery of Canada (no. 3352)]]\n\nMcGillivray traveled across Canada for inspiration.<ref name=\":1\" /> She painted her environment using bold colours and the contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through a large amount of paint applied using the palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including her hometown of Whitby, and her travel to the Gatineau area <ref name=\":0\" />, as well as to Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, and to Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She worked in many media which included watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art. Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* {{Cite book|last=Allen |first=W C.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1090427835|title=She is one of the best : a researcher's notes on the life and times of canadian artist Florence...

Wahroonga is about 9 kilometres north of nearby [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]].\n\n==History==\n\nWahroonga is an [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word meaning ''our home''. In the early days of the British colonisation of [[New South Wales]], the main activity was cutting down the tall trees which grew there.

Armed with four {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns, the ships were much larger and more powerfully-armed than their predecessors. Completed in 1907, she was assigned to the [[Mediterranean Squadron (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] ({{lang|fr|Escadre de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e}}).\n\nDuring [[World War I]], ''Victor Hugo'' escorted convoys as well as the [[capital ship]]s of the French fleet. The ship participated in the [[Otranto Barrage|blockade]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] until 1917 when she was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. Four years later, the cruiser was reactivated; she served in the [[Far East]] in 1922\u20131923 and went back into reserve upon her return. ''Victor Hugo'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1930.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:L\u00e9on Gambetta class cruiser diagrams Brasseys 1923.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in ''[[Brassey's Naval Annual]]'' 1923]]\nThe ''L\u00e9on Gambetta''-class ships were designed as enlarged and more powerful versions of the {{sclass-|Gloire|cruiser|0}} armored cruisers. ''Victor Hugo'', the last ship to be built, was slightly longer than her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|French cruiser|L\u00e9on Gambetta||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Ferry||2}} and measured {{convert|149.07|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length overall|overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.18|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The sisters were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|12550|t|LT|sp=us|lk=on}} at normal load. Their crew normally numbered 26 officers and 708 enlisted men, or 30 officers and 749 men when serving as a [[flagship]].<ref name=jc3>Jordan & Caresse, p. 143</ref>\n\nThe ships had three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. Each of the sisters used a different model of [[water-tube boiler]] and ''Victor Hugo'' was fitted with 28 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at a total of {{convert|27500|PS|lk=on|sp=us}} to reach their designed speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. During her [[sea trial]]s on 2 March 1907, ''Victor Hugo'' reached {{convert|22.3|kn}} from {{convert|28344|PS}}. The cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of {{convert|7500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 143, 157\u2013158, 160</ref>\n\nThe [[main battery]] of the ''L\u00e9on Gambetta'' class consisted of four [[Canon de 194 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893-1896|194-millimeter Mod\u00e8le 1893\u20131896]] guns mounted in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. Their [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] comprised sixteen [[Canon de 164 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893|{{convert|164|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} Mod\u00e8le 1893\u20131896M]] guns.

Their [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{cvt|33|to|65|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick. The front and side sides of the [[conning tower]] consisted of {{convert|174|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} armor plates.<ref name=jc3/>\n\n==Construction and career==\nNamed after the novelist [[Victor Hugo]], [[Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan]], [[List of naval ministers of France|Minister of the Navy]], ordered the [[Arsenal de Toulon]] to begin work on the ship on 11 March 1901 in compliance with the recently passed Naval Law ({{lang|fr|Statut Naval}}). The order was transferred to the [[Arsenal de Lorient]] on 3 June 1902 even though that [[shipyard]] was committed to building two of the preceding {{sclass-|Gloire|cruiser|0}} armored cruisers. Coupled with the need to transport the assembled materials to [[Lorient]], the change delayed her [[keel laying]] until 2 March 1903. ''Victor Hugo'' was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 30 March 1904 and began her sea trials on 15 January 1907. The cruiser was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] ({{lang|fr|armement d\u00e9finitif}}) on 16 April. Her construction cost 30,748,300 [[French franc|francs]].<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 139\u2013141, 160, 213</ref>\n\nOn 8 May ''Victor Hugo'' departed Lorient for [[Jamestown, Virginia]], to participate in the [[Jamestown Exposition]], together with the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Kl\u00e9ber||2}} and the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Chasseloup-Laubat||2}}. By 20 May they were visiting New York City; the ships returned to Jamestown on 31 May where they participated in the [[naval review]] presided over by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on 10 June. Upon her return to France later that month, ''Victor Hugo'' was assigned to the Light Squadron ({{lang|fr|Escadre l\u00e9g\u00e8re}}) of the Mediterranean Squadron. On 5 October 1909, the French Navy reorganized its forces and redesignated the Mediterranean Squadron as the 1st Squadron ({{lang|fr|1<sup>er</sup> Escadre}}) and the Light Squadron became the 1st Light Division ({{lang|fr|1<sup>er</sup> Division l\u00e9g\u00e8re}} (DL)). The ship was assigned to the 2nd DL of the 1st Squadron on 4 April 1911 with her sisters, although she was reduced to reserve later in the year. ''Victor Hugo'' had been reactivated by 10 February 1912 when she was reassigned to the 2nd DL.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 160, 210\u2013211; Sieche, pp. 150, 155, 157</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the [[Royal Navy]] would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate her fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French designated the consolidated fleet the 1st Naval Army ({{lang|fr|1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e Navale}}) and grouped its two DLs into the 1st Light Squadron.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 210, 214</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nWhen [[Imperial Germany]] declared war on France on 3 August 1914, the ship was still assigned to the 2nd DL. The following day the cruisers were part of the escorting force for a troop convoy from [[Algiers]], [[French Algeria]] to [[Metropolitan France]]. On 13 August Vice Admiral [[Augustin Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re]], commander of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces in the Central Mediterranean, was ordered to begin offensive operations against the Austro-Hungarian fleet in the Adriatic. He decided to break the Austro-Hungarian blockade of the port of [[Bar|Antivari]], [[Montenegro]], and to engage any ships operating out of nearby [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. He split his available forces into two groups with the armored cruisers following the Albanian coast and the battleships tracing the Italian coast before cutting across the Adriatic to rendezvous at Antivari on the morning of the 16th. The latter sank the [[protected cruiser]] {{SMS|Zenta}} that morning in the [[Battle of Antivari]] as the armored cruisers were coming up from the south.<ref>Freivogel, pp. 96, 101; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 218, 222, 227</ref>\n\nAt the end of the month, the French began intermittently escorting single [[cargo ship]]s to Antivari, usually escorted by the armored cruisers and covered by the main battlefleet. The first of these was on 31 September when four armored cruisers escorted the steamer {{SS|Liamone}} while the battleships bombarded the defenses of Cattaro. The 2nd DL escorted the cargo ship {{SS|Henri Fraissinet}} as it brought long-range artillery pieces to Antivari on 18\u201319 September. On the return voyage, they took advantage of the fog to bombard Cattaro before they were forced to withdraw by heavy return fire. The 2nd DL participated in the next sortie into the Adriatic on 17 October, but it was uneventful. During the following mission, begun at the end of October, the 2nd DL raided the island of [[Lastovo]] on 2 November and ''Jules Ferry'' was narrowly missed by ''[[SM U-5 (Austria-Hungary)|U-5]]'', an Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]], on the return voyage the following day. The torpedoing of the [[dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}} on 21 December brought an end to the sorties into the Adriatic by the battlefleet; henceforth the supply ships were escorted by the armored cruisers or smaller ships. The French also responded by moving their patrol line further south to a line north of the Greek island of [[Corfu]].<ref>Freivogel, pp. 98\u2013100, 117\u2013122; Halpern, p. 4; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] signed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] on 26 April 1915, agreeing to declare war on Austro-Hungary. Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re, concerned about a possible pre-emptive attack on the southern Italian ports, temporarily moved all of his armored cruisers, including the three sisters, closer to the Strait of Otranto that day. ''L\u00e9on Gambetta'' was torpedoed and sunk by ''U-5'' with heavy loss of life on the 27th. After the sinking, Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re withdrew his armored cruisers even further south to a patrol line running through the Gerogombos [[lighthouse]] on the island of [[Cephalonia]]. He also ordered that patrols should be made a speed of {{convert|14|kn}}, not the leisurely {{convert|6|kn}} used by ''L\u00e9on Gambetta''{{'}}s late [[captain (nautical)|captain]]. After the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, the French ships withdrew further into the Mediterranean and [[Ionian Sea]]s with the 2nd DL ultimately basing itself at [[Alexandria]], [[Sultanate of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Bizerte]], [[French Tunisia]], and [[Crown Colony of Malta|British Malta]]; the division was responsible for patrolling the area between [[Capo Colonna]] in southern Italy and the easternmost point of the Greek island of [[Crete]].<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1915, the French and British decided that the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Serbian Army's position in Montenegro and Albania]] was untenable and that it would have to be evacuated. ''Victor Hugo'' helped transfer some of the evacuees from [[Brindisi]], Italy, to Bizerte in early January. The Allies occupied the neutral island of Corfu on 9 January to provide a place for the Serbs to recuperate and to rebuild their army. In March, they occupied the Greek island of [[Argostoli]] to serve as a base for the battlefleet while the armored cruisers were based further north at Corfu. The [[Royal Serbian Army]] deemed fit for combat in May and the French armored cruisers provided distant [[Covering force|cover]] for the transfer to the [[Salonica Front]] until it was completed on 15 June. Shortages of coal and trained manpower hampered most training for the rest of the year and became worse in 1917. As tensions rose between the Allies and the neutral Greek government in early 1917, ''Victor Hugo'' and the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Michelet||2}} were tasked to patrol the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and prevent any Greek troops from moving from their positions in the [[Peloponnese]] across the bridge over the [[Corinth Canal]] on 28 April to interfere with Allied operations in [[Athens]]. The 2nd DL landed a [[company (military)|company]] of [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese troops]] on 11 June and reinforced them with machine-gun armed sailors until King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] abdicated the following day and a pro-Allied government was installed. On 12 August, the 2nd DL was disbanded with ''Victor Hugo'' reduced to reserve at Bizerte and ''Jules Ferry'' was assigned to transport duties for the next year.<ref>Freivogel, p. 219; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 238\u2013240, 243\u2013245</ref>\n\n''Victor Hugo'' was reactivated in 1921 and assigned to the Atlantic Flying Division ({{lang|fr|Division volante de l'Atlantique}}). The following year she was transferred to the Far Eastern Division ({{lang|fr|Division navale de l'Extr\u00eame Orient}}).

Armed with four {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} guns, the ships were much larger and more powerfully-armed than their predecessors. Completed in 1907, she was assigned to the [[Mediterranean Squadron (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] ({{lang|fr|Escadre de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e}}).\n\nDuring [[World War I]], ''Victor Hugo'' escorted convoys as well as the [[capital ship]]s of the French fleet. The ship participated in the [[Otranto Barrage|blockade]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] until 1917 when she was reduced to [[Reserve fleet|reserve]]. Four years later, the cruiser was reactivated; she served in the [[Far East]] in 1922\u20131923 and went back into reserve upon her return. ''Victor Hugo'' was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1930.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:L\u00e9on Gambetta class cruiser diagrams Brasseys 1923.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in ''[[Brassey's Naval Annual]]'' 1923]]\nThe ''L\u00e9on Gambetta''-class ships were designed as enlarged and more powerful versions of the {{sclass-|Gloire|cruiser|0}} armored cruisers. ''Victor Hugo'', the last ship to be built, was slightly longer than her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|French cruiser|L\u00e9on Gambetta||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Ferry||2}} and measured {{convert|149.07|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length overall|overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21.4|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.18|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The sisters were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|12550|t|LT|sp=us|lk=on}} at normal load. Their crew normally numbered 26 officers and 708 enlisted men, or 30 officers and 749 men when serving as a [[flagship]].<ref name=jc3>Jordan & Caresse, p. 143</ref>\n\nThe ships had three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. Each of the sisters used a different model of [[water-tube boiler]] and ''Victor Hugo'' was fitted with 28 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at a total of {{convert|27500|PS|lk=on|sp=us}} to reach their designed speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. During her [[sea trial]]s on 2 March 1907, ''Victor Hugo'' reached {{convert|22.3|kn}} from {{convert|28344|PS}}. The cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of {{convert|7500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 143, 157\u2013158, 160</ref>\n\nThe [[main battery]] of the ''L\u00e9on Gambetta'' class consisted of four [[Canon de 194 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893-1896|194-millimeter Mod\u00e8le 1893\u20131896]] guns mounted in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft of the [[superstructure]]. Their [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary armament]] comprised sixteen [[Canon de 164 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893|{{convert|164|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} Mod\u00e8le 1893\u20131896M]] guns. Twelve of these were in three twin-gun turrets on each [[broadside]] and the remaining four guns were in [[Casemate#Single casemates (1889 onwards)|casemates]] in the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]].<ref name=g5>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 306</ref> Unlike her sisters, ''Victor Hugo'' was fitted with twenty-four  [[Canon de 47 mm mod\u00e8le 1902|{{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} Canon de 47 mm mod\u00e8le 1902 guns]] for defense against [[torpedo boat]].<ref name=s2>Silverstone, p. 80</ref> She was also armed with two submerged {{convert|450|mm|in|adj=on|1|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each broadside, and could carry 20 [[naval mine]]s.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 145, 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nThe cruisers' [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] ranged in thickness from {{convert|80|to|150|mm|1|sp=us}} and the main-gun turrets were protected by armor {{convert|138|mm|1|sp=us}} thick. Their [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{cvt|33|to|65|mm|in|1|sp=us}} thick. The front and side sides of the [[conning tower]] consisted of {{convert|174|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} armor plates.<ref name=jc3/>\n\n==Construction and career==\nNamed after the novelist [[Victor Hugo]], [[Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan]], [[List of naval ministers of France|Minister of the Navy]], ordered the [[Arsenal de Toulon]] to begin work on the ship on 11 March 1901 in compliance with the recently passed Naval Law ({{lang|fr|Statut Naval}}). The order was transferred to the [[Arsenal de Lorient]] on 3 June 1902 even though that [[shipyard]] was committed to building two of the preceding {{sclass-|Gloire|cruiser|0}} armored cruisers. Coupled with the need to transport the assembled materials to [[Lorient]], the change delayed her [[keel laying]] until 2 March 1903. ''Victor Hugo'' was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 30 March 1904 and began her sea trials on 15 January 1907. The cruiser was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] ({{lang|fr|armement d\u00e9finitif}}) on 16 April. Her construction cost 30,748,300 [[French franc|francs]].<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 139\u2013141, 160, 213</ref>\n\nOn 8 May ''Victor Hugo'' departed Lorient for [[Jamestown, Virginia]], to participate in the [[Jamestown Exposition]], together with the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Kl\u00e9ber||2}} and the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Chasseloup-Laubat||2}}. By 20 May they were visiting New York City; the ships returned to Jamestown on 31 May where they participated in the [[naval review]] presided over by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on 10 June. Upon her return to France later that month, ''Victor Hugo'' was assigned to the Light Squadron ({{lang|fr|Escadre l\u00e9g\u00e8re}}) of the Mediterranean Squadron. On 5 October 1909, the French Navy reorganized its forces and redesignated the Mediterranean Squadron as the 1st Squadron ({{lang|fr|1<sup>er</sup> Escadre}}) and the Light Squadron became the 1st Light Division ({{lang|fr|1<sup>er</sup> Division l\u00e9g\u00e8re}} (DL)). The ship was assigned to the 2nd DL of the 1st Squadron on 4 April 1911 with her sisters, although she was reduced to reserve later in the year. ''Victor Hugo'' had been reactivated by 10 February 1912 when she was reassigned to the 2nd DL.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 160, 210\u2013211; Sieche, pp. 150, 155, 157</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the [[Royal Navy]] would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate her fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French designated the consolidated fleet the 1st Naval Army ({{lang|fr|1<sup>re</sup> Arm\u00e9e Navale}}) and grouped its two DLs into the 1st Light Squadron.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 210, 214</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nWhen [[Imperial Germany]] declared war on France on 3 August 1914, the ship was still assigned to the 2nd DL. The following day the cruisers were part of the escorting force for a troop convoy from [[Algiers]], [[French Algeria]] to [[Metropolitan France]]. On 13 August Vice Admiral [[Augustin Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re]], commander of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces in the Central Mediterranean, was ordered to begin offensive operations against the Austro-Hungarian fleet in the Adriatic. He decided to break the Austro-Hungarian blockade of the port of [[Bar|Antivari]], [[Montenegro]], and to engage any ships operating out of nearby [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. He split his available forces into two groups with the armored cruisers following the Albanian coast and the battleships tracing the Italian coast before cutting across the Adriatic to rendezvous at Antivari on the morning of the 16th. The latter sank the [[protected cruiser]] {{SMS|Zenta}} that morning in the [[Battle of Antivari]] as the armored cruisers were coming up from the south.<ref>Freivogel, pp. 96, 101; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 218, 222, 227</ref>\n\nAt the end of the month, the French began intermittently escorting single [[cargo ship]]s to Antivari, usually escorted by the armored cruisers and covered by the main battlefleet. The first of these was on 31 September when four armored cruisers escorted the steamer {{SS|Liamone}} while the battleships bombarded the defenses of Cattaro. The 2nd DL escorted the cargo ship {{SS|Henri Fraissinet}} as it brought long-range artillery pieces to Antivari on 18\u201319 September. On the return voyage, they took advantage of the fog to bombard Cattaro before they were forced to withdraw by heavy return fire. The 2nd DL participated in the next sortie into the Adriatic on 17 October, but it was uneventful. During the following mission, begun at the end of October, the 2nd DL raided the island of [[Lastovo]] on 2 November and ''Jules Ferry'' was narrowly missed by ''[[SM U-5 (Austria-Hungary)|U-5]]'', an Austro-Hungarian [[U-boat]], on the return voyage the following day. The torpedoing of the [[dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1911|2}} on 21 December brought an end to the sorties into the Adriatic by the battlefleet; henceforth the supply ships were escorted by the armored cruisers or smaller ships. The French also responded by moving their patrol line further south to a line north of the Greek island of [[Corfu]].<ref>Freivogel, pp. 98\u2013100, 117\u2013122; Halpern, p. 4; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] signed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] on 26 April 1915, agreeing to declare war on Austro-Hungary. Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re, concerned about a possible pre-emptive attack on the southern Italian ports, temporarily moved all of his armored cruisers, including the three sisters, closer to the Strait of Otranto that day. ''L\u00e9on Gambetta'' was torpedoed and sunk by ''U-5'' with heavy loss of life on the 27th. After the sinking, Bou\u00e9 de Lapeyr\u00e8re withdrew his armored cruisers even further south to a patrol line running through the Gerogombos [[lighthouse]] on the island of [[Cephalonia]]. He also ordered that patrols should be made a speed of {{convert|14|kn}}, not the leisurely {{convert|6|kn}} used by ''L\u00e9on Gambetta''{{'}}s late [[captain (nautical)|captain]]. After the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, the French ships withdrew further into the Mediterranean and [[Ionian Sea]]s with the 2nd DL ultimately basing itself at [[Alexandria]], [[Sultanate of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Bizerte]], [[French Tunisia]], and [[Crown Colony of Malta|British Malta]]; the division was responsible for patrolling the area between [[Capo Colonna]] in southern Italy and the easternmost point of the Greek island of [[Crete]].<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1915, the French and British decided that the [[Great Retreat (Serbian)|Serbian Army's position in Montenegro and Albania]] was untenable and that it would have to be evacuated. ''Victor Hugo'' helped transfer some of the evacuees from [[Brindisi]], Italy, to Bizerte in early January. The Allies occupied the neutral island of Corfu on 9 January to provide a place for the Serbs to recuperate and to rebuild their army. In March, they occupied the Greek island of [[Argostoli]] to serve as a base for the battlefleet while the armored cruisers were based further north at Corfu. The [[Royal Serbian Army]] deemed fit for combat in May and the French armored cruisers provided distant [[Covering force|cover]] for the transfer to the [[Salonica Front]] until it was completed on 15 June. Shortages of coal and trained manpower hampered most training for the rest of the year and became worse in 1917. As tensions rose between the Allies and the neutral Greek government in early 1917, ''Victor Hugo'' and the armored cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Jules Michelet||2}} were tasked to patrol the [[Gulf of Corinth]] and prevent any Greek troops from moving from their positions in the [[Peloponnese]] across the bridge over the [[Corinth Canal]] on 28 April to interfere with Allied operations in [[Athens]]. The 2nd DL landed a [[company (military)|company]] of [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese troops]] on 11 June and reinforced them with machine-gun armed sailors until King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] abdicated the following day and a pro-Allied government was installed. On 12 August, the 2nd DL was disbanded with ''Victor Hugo'' reduced to reserve at Bizerte and ''Jules Ferry'' was assigned to transport duties for the next year.<ref>Freivogel, p. 219; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 238\u2013240, 243\u2013245</ref>\n\n''Victor Hugo'' was reactivated in 1921 and assigned to the Atlantic Flying Division ({{lang|fr|Division volante de l'Atlantique}}). The following year she was transferred to the Far Eastern Division ({{lang|fr|Division navale de l'Extr\u00eame Orient}}). Departing on 12 October 1922 with ''Jules Michelet'', they arrived in [[Saigon]], [[French Indochina]], on 19 April 1923. Her service there was uneventful and the ship arrived back in [[Toulon]] on 11 July at which time she was placed in reserve. ''Victor Hugo'' was stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 20 January 1928 and sold for scrap on 26 November 1930.<ref>Jordan & Caresse, pp. 253\u2013254, 259</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860\u20131905|editor1-last=Chesneau |editor1-first=Roger|editor2-last=Kolesnik|editor2-first=Eugene M.|publisher=Mayflower Books |location=New York|year=1979|isbn=0-8317-0302-4 |lastauthoramp=y|url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/conwaysallworlds0000unse_l2e2}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Freivogel |first1=Zvonimir |title=The Great War in the Adriatic Sea 1914\u20131918 |date=2019 |publisher=Despot Infinitus |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-8218-40-8}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Halpern\n  | first = Paul G.|authorlink=Paul G.
