These captive herds and two large isolated free-ranging herds in the Yukon and Northwest Territories all derive from disease-free and morphologically representative founding stock from northern [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in northeastern Alberta and southern Northwest Territories. These captive herds are particularly important for conservation and recovery purposes, because the larger free-ranging herds in and around Wood Buffalo National Park were infected with bovine [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] after 7,000 [[plains bison]] <!-- (''Bison bison bison'') --> were trans-shipped by barge from [[Buffalo National Park]] near [[Wainwright, Alberta]], in the 1920s.\n\nDiseases including [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] remain [[endemism|endemic]] in the free-ranging herds in and around Wood Buffalo National Park.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Joly | first = D.

Open to anyone, regardless of gender or WWE employment status, the championship is defended \"[[24/7 service|24/7]]\", as in any time, [[Falls Count Anywhere match|anywhere]], as long as a WWE referee is present. Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands: [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]], as well as outside of regular WWE shows, often with videos posted on WWE's website and social media accounts. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 rule|24/7 rule]]\".\n\nThe championship was introduced on the May 20, 2019, episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', during which [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion by securing the title belt first in a scramble involving several other wrestlers. The current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign. He won the title by pinning [[Mojo Rawley]] during night two of [[WrestleMania 36]], which [[Broadcast delay|aired]] on April 5, 2020; the event was taped on March 25 and March 26, but it is currently unknown which day this title change was taped.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 96 recognized reigns between 36 different people. [[R-Truth]] has the most reigns at 35 and the longest combined reign at 165 days (152 days as recognized by WWE). [[Riddick Moss]]' reign is the longest singular reign at 41 days (40 days as recognized by WWE). Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.<ref name=\"OfficialTitleHistory\"/>\n\nNon-wrestlers to have held the title include [[Fox Sports|Fox]] sportscaster [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]], NBA player Enes Kanter, [[electronic music]] producer/[[disc jockey]] [[Marshmello]], WWE Senior Account Manager Michael Giaccio, [[NASCAR]] driver [[Kyle Busch]], and ''Raw'' announcer Mike Rome.<ref name=OfficialTitleHistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/24-7-championship|title=24/7 Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=June 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Title history==\n''Note: Unless otherwise noted, the fall took place in the ring.''\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|days=yes|days2=yes|dayless=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Titus|O'Neil}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|May 20, 2019}}\n|days     = <1\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Albany, NY]]\n|event    = ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''\n|notes    = After the establishment of the championship, [[Mick Foley]] laid the belt in the ring.

Open to anyone, regardless of gender or WWE employment status, the championship is defended \"[[24/7 service|24/7]]\", as in any time, [[Falls Count Anywhere match|anywhere]], as long as a WWE referee is present. Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands: [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]], as well as outside of regular WWE shows, often with videos posted on WWE's website and social media accounts. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 rule|24/7 rule]]\".\n\nThe championship was introduced on the May 20, 2019, episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', during which [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion by securing the title belt first in a scramble involving several other wrestlers. The current champion is [[Rob Gronkowski]], who is in his first reign. He won the title by pinning [[Mojo Rawley]] during night two of [[WrestleMania 36]], which [[Broadcast delay|aired]] on April 5, 2020; the event was taped on March 25 and March 26, but it is currently unknown which day this title change was taped.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been 96 recognized reigns between 36 different people. [[R-Truth]] has the most reigns at 35 and the longest combined reign at 165 days (152 days as recognized by WWE). [[Riddick Moss]]' reign is the longest singular reign at 41 days (40 days as recognized by WWE). Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.<ref name=\"OfficialTitleHistory\"/>\n\nNon-wrestlers to have held the title include [[Fox Sports|Fox]] sportscaster [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]], NBA player Enes Kanter, [[electronic music]] producer/[[disc jockey]] [[Marshmello]], WWE Senior Account Manager Michael Giaccio, [[NASCAR]] driver [[Kyle Busch]], and ''Raw'' announcer Mike Rome.<ref name=OfficialTitleHistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/titlehistory/24-7-championship|title=24/7 Championship|publisher=WWE|accessdate=June 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Title history==\n''Note: Unless otherwise noted, the fall took place in the ring.''\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}.\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|days=yes|days2=yes|dayless=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname|Titus|O'Neil}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|May 20, 2019}}\n|days     = <1\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Albany, NY]]\n|event    = ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''\n|notes    = After the establishment of the championship, [[Mick Foley]] laid the belt in the ring.

It was expected that an opera house would be: <blockquote>a substitute for a general drawing room &ndash; a refined attraction which the ill-mannered would not be likely to frequent, and around which the higher classes might gather, for the easier interchange of courtesies, and for that closer view which aides the candidacy of acquaintance.<ref>Nathaniel Parker Willis, quoted in Burrows & Wallace, p.724</ref></blockquote>  In pursuit of this agenda, the theatre was created with the comfort of the upper classes in mind: benches, the normal seating in theatres at the time, were replaced by upholstered seats, available only by subscription, as were the two tiers of boxes.  On the other hand, 500 general admission patrons were relegated to the benches of a \"cockloft\" reachable only by a narrow stairway, and otherwise isolated from the gentry below,<ref name=g724 /> and the theatre enforced a dress code which required \"freshly shaven faces, evening dress, and kid gloves.\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.760</ref>\n\nLimiting the attendance of the lower classes was partly intended to avoid the problems of rowdyism which plagued other theaters in the entertainment district at the time, especially in the theatres on [[the Bowery]].  Nevertheless, it was the deadly [[Astor Place riot]] in 1849 which caused the theatre to close permanently &ndash; provoked by competing performances of ''[[Macbeth]]'' by English actor [[William Charles Macready]] at the Opera House (which was operating under the name \"Astor Place Theatre\", not being able to sustain itself on a full season of opera) and American [[Edwin Forrest]] at the nearby Broadway Theatre.\n\n== Clinton Hall == \n\nAfter the riot, the theater was unable to overcome the reputation of being the \"Massacre Opera House\" at \"DisAster Place.\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.765</ref>  By May 1853, the interior had been dismantled and the furnishings sold off, with the shell of the building sold for $140,000<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/06/01/75368321.pdf \"The Mercantile Library\"] ''The New York Times'' (June 1, 1854)</ref> to the [[New York Mercantile Library]], which renamed the building \"Clinton Hall\".<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1853/05/27/87854876.pdf \"Exclusiveness\"] ''The New York Times'' (May 27, 1853)</ref> \n\nIn 1890, in need of additional space, the Association tore down the opera house building and replaced it with an 11-story building, also called Clinton Hall, which still stands on the site.<ref>White, Norval & Willensky, p.162</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n*{{cite gotham}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=354XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA515&dq=%22astor%22+%22john+sefton%22+%221847%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_oOS_aT0xgIVEzGICh3NGwVp#v=onepage&q=%22astor%22%20%22john%20sefton%22%20%221847%22&f=false|title=Records of the New York Stage: from 1750 to 1860|volume=2|author=Ireland, Joseph Norton|publisher=T.

It was expected that an opera house would be: <blockquote>a substitute for a general drawing room &ndash; a refined attraction which the ill-mannered would not be likely to frequent, and around which the higher classes might gather, for the easier interchange of courtesies, and for that closer view which aides the candidacy of acquaintance.<ref>Nathaniel Parker Willis, quoted in Burrows & Wallace, p.724</ref></blockquote>  In pursuit of this agenda, the theatre was created with the comfort of the upper classes in mind: benches, the normal seating in theatres at the time, were replaced by upholstered seats, available only by subscription, as were the two tiers of boxes.  On the other hand, 500 general admission patrons were relegated to the benches of a \"cockloft\" reachable only by a narrow stairway, and otherwise isolated from the gentry below,<ref name=g724 /> and the theatre enforced a dress code which required \"freshly shaven faces, evening dress, and kid gloves.\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.760</ref>\n\nLimiting the attendance of the lower classes was partly intended to avoid the problems of rowdyism which plagued other theaters in the entertainment district at the time, especially in the theatres on [[the Bowery]].  Nevertheless, it was the deadly [[Astor Place riot]] in 1849 which caused the theatre to close permanently &ndash; provoked by competing performances of ''[[Macbeth]]'' by English actor [[William Charles Macready]] at the Opera House (which was operating under the name \"Astor Place Theatre\", not being able to sustain itself on a full season of opera) and American [[Edwin Forrest]] at the nearby Broadway Theatre.\n\n== Clinton Hall == \n\nAfter the riot, the theater was unable to overcome the reputation of being the \"Massacre Opera House\" at \"DisAster Place.\"<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.765</ref>  By May 1853, the interior had been dismantled and the furnishings sold off, with the shell of the building sold for $140,000<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/06/01/75368321.pdf \"The Mercantile Library\"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (June 1, 1854)</ref> to the [[New York Mercantile Library]], which renamed the building \"Clinton Hall\".<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1853/05/27/87854876.pdf \"Exclusiveness\"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (May 27, 1853)</ref> \n\nIn 1890, in need of additional space, the Association tore down the opera house building and replaced it with an 11-story building, also called Clinton Hall, which still stands on the site.<ref>White, Norval & Willensky, p.162</ref>\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n*{{cite gotham}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=354XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA515&dq=%22astor%22+%22john+sefton%22+%221847%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_oOS_aT0xgIVEzGICh3NGwVp#v=onepage&q=%22astor%22%20%22john%20sefton%22%20%221847%22&f=false|title=Records of the New York Stage: from 1750 to 1860|volume=2|author=Ireland, Joseph Norton|publisher=T.

His father died some time in 1833, and Johns and his three brothers took work as [[copper]] [[miner]]s. In 1841 the family was living at [[Illogan]], Cornwall, but by 1848 Johns had migrated to [[Wales]], taking work as an [[iron ore]] miner, probably at the [[Clydach, Monmouthshire|Clydach]] Iron Works.<ref name=\"Devereux 2006\">{{cite journal | author = Devereux, Drew | year = 2006 | title = Early life of Moondyne Joe | journal = Dollypot, Greenhide and Spindrift: a journal of bush history | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.hesperianpress.com/dollypot_greenhide/Vol2_no3.htm | accessdate = 22 November 2006 | isbn = 0-85905-416-0 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062004/http://www.hesperianpress.com/dollypot_greenhide/Vol2_no3.htm |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}{{better source|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Prison ===\nOn 15 November 1848, Johns and an associate using the name William Cross, the pseudonym for the convict [[John Williams (convict)|John Williams]], were arrested near [[Chepstow]] for \"[[Theft|stealing]] from the house of Richard Price, three loaves of bread, one piece of bacon, several cheeses, and other goods\".<ref name=\"The Welshman 30/03/1849\">{{cite news | title = [[Wikisource:The Welshman/30&nbsp;March 1849|Breconshire Lent Assizes]] | work = [[Wikisource:The Welshman|The Welshman]] | pages = 1849\u201303\u201330}}</ref> [[Arraignment|Arraigned]] at the [[Brecon]] [[Assizes#England and Wales|Assizes]] on charges of [[burglary]] and stealing, the pair [[plea]]ded not guilty.

The pair were transferred to [[HM Prison Dartmoor|Dartmoor Prison]] on 21 October 1851, but shortly afterwards Johns was transferred to the [[Woolwich]] [[Hulk (ship type)|prison hulk]] ''Justitia'', probably for [[discipline|disciplinary]] reasons. When the ''Justitia'' was destroyed by fire, he was transferred to the ''Defence''. About a year later, he boarded the prison ship ''[[Pyrenees (ship)|Pyrenees]]'' for [[penal transportation|transportation]] to what was then the British [[penal colony]] of [[Western Australia]] to serve out the remainder of his sentence.<ref name=\"Edgar 1990\"/> In turn, Williams was transported to [[Van Diemen's Land]] in March 1852.\n\n=== Australia bound ===\n[[File:Avon vally gnangarra-30.jpg|thumb|Remnants of Moondyne Joe's gate; it was this gate that he used to trap stock]]\n\n''Pyrenees'' sailed for Western Australia on 2 February 1853, and arrived in [[Fremantle]] on 30 April.<ref name=pyrenees>{{cite news|title=Shipping Intelligence|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page717342|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News|date=4 July 1851}}</ref> In reward for good behaviour, Johns was issued with a [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]] on arrival, and on 10 March 1855 he received a conditional pardon. He then settled in the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon]] Valley, one of the most rugged and inaccessible places in the [[Darling Scarp|Darling Range]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] name for the area was ''Moondyne''. Johns made a living by partly fencing the springs in the area, and trapping escaped stock and horses. Often a reward was offered for the return of such animals.<ref name=\"Edgar 1990\"/>\n\nIn August 1861, Johns caught an unbranded stallion and branded it with his own mark. This was effectively horse stealing, and when the police heard of this they arrested him at their first opportunity. The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the [[Toodyay, Western Australia|Toodyay]] lockup. Sometime during the night, Johns broke out of his cell, and stole the horse once more, taking also the local magistrate's brand-new saddle and bridle. He was caught the next day but, while on the run, he had killed the horse and cut his brand out of the hide, thus destroying the evidence. Consequently, he received only a three-year sentence for jail-breaking, whereas a typical sentence for horse stealing was more than ten years.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\">{{cite book|author=Elliot, Ian|year=1978|title=Moondyne Joe: The Man and the Myth|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-130-4}} Republished in 1998 by Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. {{ISBN|0-85905-244-3}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Johns was serving his sentence, there was a rash of convict escapes and attempted escapes, but Johns remained well behaved. His good behaviour earned him a remission on his sentence, and he was released on a ticket of leave in February 1864. He then found work on Henry Martin's<!-- speculate this is the same Martin after whom the suburb in the same area is named--> farm in [[Kelmscott, Western Australia|Kelmscott]]. In January 1865, a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] named \"Bright\" belonging to William Wallace was killed, and Johns was accused of the deed. He was arrested on 29 March, found guilty on 5 July, and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3753477 |title=Supreme Court\u2014Criminal Side. |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and West Australian Times]] |date=7 July 1865 |accessdate=7 July 2017 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Johns was to protest his innocence of this crime for the rest of his life. He was determined not to serve what he felt was an unjust sentence and, in early November, he and another prisoner absconded from a work party. They were on the run for nearly a month, during which time they committed a number of small robberies. It was during this time that Johns first adopted the nickname ''Moondyne Joe''. They were finally caught {{Convert|37|km|abbr=off}} east of [[York, Western Australia|York]] by a party of policemen that included [[Tommy Windich]], an [[Aboriginal tracker]]. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Johns was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to [[Fremantle Prison]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Escape ===\nIn April 1866, Johns sent a petition to the [[Chief Justice of Western Australia|Chief Justice]], and received four years off his sentence. This was apparently unsatisfactory to him for, in July, he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door. Early in August, he succeeded in escaping again. After cutting off his irons, he met up with three other escapees, and together they roamed the bush around Perth, committing a number of robberies and narrowly escaping capture on a number of occasions. Near the end of the month, one of the gang was captured by police. Realising that the gang could not elude the police forever, Johns formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to the colony of South Australia. This would be a long and arduous journey through extremely arid land, and the gang would have to be very well equipped if it were to stand any chance of success. On 5 September, Johns equipped his company by committing the biggest robbery of his career, stealing supplies and equipment from the Toodyay store of an old enemy, James Everett. The gang then started travelling east along the explorer [[Charles Cooke Hunt|Charles Hunt]]'s established route. Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September, about {{Convert|160|km}} east of York. A team of police then set out after them, and they were captured on 29 September 1866 at Boodalin Soak, about {{convert|6|km|spell=in}} north-west of the present-day site of the town of [[Westonia, Western Australia|Westonia]], approximately {{convert|300|km}} north-east of [[Perth]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n[[File:FremantleprisonMoondynescell.JPG|thumb|right|Moondyne Joe's \"escape-proof\" cell]]\n\n=== Hard labour ===\nAs punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Johns received five years' hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was sent to [[Fremantle Prison]], and kept in the yard with his neck chained to the iron bar of a window, while a special \"escape-proof\" cell was made for him. The stone-walled cell was lined with [[Eucalyptus marginata|jarrah]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] and over one thousand nails, and was almost air-proof and light-proof. Johns was kept in the cell on a bread and water diet, with only one to two hours of exercise a day. In early 1867, due to his diminishing health, Johns was set to work breaking stone in the open air but, rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder. [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] [[John Hampton]] was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\". However, the rock broken by Johns was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the [[limestone]] wall of the prison.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn 7 March 1867, Johns escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. Despite an extensive manhunt, no sign of him was found, and he would not be recaptured for nearly two years. He did not return to any of his old haunts, and he committed no crimes, so the authorities received very little information about him. Also, many convicts were encouraged by Johns' audacious escape, and a number of escapes were attempted in the following months, so that he was quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn the 25 February 1869, Johns tried to steal some wine from the cellars at [[Houghton Wines|Houghton Winery]]. By chance, the owner had been helping with a police search, and afterwards invited a group of police back to the vineyard for refreshments. When the owner entered the cellar, Johns assumed that he was discovered, and made a dash for the door into the arms of the police. He was returned to prison, sentenced to an additional 12 months, half to be in separate confinement, for absconding. On 22 March 1869, he was sentenced to an additional four years in irons for [[Burglary|breaking and entering]]. Johns made at least one more attempt to escape, attempting in February 1871 to create a key for his cell in the carpenter's workshop, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, in April 1871, Comptroller General Wakeford heard from Johns of Hampton's promise. After verifying with Superintendent Lefroy that those words were spoken, Wakeford informed the current governor, [[Frederick Weld]], who agreed that further punishment would be unfair. Johns was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Later life ===\nThe remainder of Johns' life consisted of periods of good behaviour punctuated by occasional minor misdemeanors and brief jail terms. In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time prospecting for gold near [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]]. In 1881, while exploring the countryside around [[Karridale, Western Australia|Karridale]], he discovered [[Moondyne Cave]].\n\n=== Final years and death ===\nIn 1893, Johns' wife Louisa died at the age of 40, and the death affected him greatly. Years after, he began acting strangely, and was eventually found to be mentally ill. He died of senile [[dementia]] in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum (now the [[Fremantle Arts Centre]] building) on 13 August 1900, and was buried in [[Fremantle Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\" /> His tombstone bears the word \"rhyddid\", meaning \"freedom\" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n\n===Literature and film===\n[[File:John Boyle O'Reilly cph.3a38519.jpg|thumb|left|It has been said{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that the tales of Moondyne Joe inspired John Boyle O'Reilly to make his daring escape in 1869]]\n\nWhile Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869, an [[Ireland|Irish]] political prisoner named [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] was working in a convict road party near [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]]. Although it is very unlikely that O'Reilly knew Moondyne Joe, he must have heard many stories of his exploits. In March 1869, O'Reilly escaped and was rescued by an American ship. After his arrival in the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called [[Moondyne|''Moondyne: An Australian Tale'']], whose central character was called Moondyne Joe.

His father died some time in 1833, and Johns and his three brothers took work as [[copper]] [[miner]]s. In 1841 the family was living at [[Illogan]], Cornwall, but by 1848 Johns had migrated to [[Wales]], taking work as an [[iron ore]] miner, probably at the [[Clydach, Monmouthshire|Clydach]] Iron Works.<ref name=\"Devereux 2006\">{{cite journal | author = Devereux, Drew | year = 2006 | title = Early life of Moondyne Joe | journal = Dollypot, Greenhide and Spindrift: a journal of bush history | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.hesperianpress.com/dollypot_greenhide/Vol2_no3.htm | accessdate = 22 November 2006 | isbn = 0-85905-416-0 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062004/http://www.hesperianpress.com/dollypot_greenhide/Vol2_no3.htm |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}{{better source|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Prison ===\nOn 15 November 1848, Johns and an associate using the name William Cross, the pseudonym for the convict [[John Williams (convict)|John Williams]], were arrested near [[Chepstow]] for \"[[Theft|stealing]] from the house of Richard Price, three loaves of bread, one piece of bacon, several cheeses, and other goods\".<ref name=\"The Welshman 30/03/1849\">{{cite news | title = [[Wikisource:The Welshman/30&nbsp;March 1849|Breconshire Lent Assizes]] | work = [[Wikisource:The Welshman|The Welshman]] | pages = 1849\u201303\u201330}}</ref> [[Arraignment|Arraigned]] at the [[Brecon]] [[Assizes#England and Wales|Assizes]] on charges of [[burglary]] and stealing, the pair [[plea]]ded not guilty.

On 1 January 1850, they were transferred to [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] to serve their mandatory six months of [[solitary confinement]]. The pair were transferred to [[HM Prison Dartmoor|Dartmoor Prison]] on 21 October 1851, but shortly afterwards Johns was transferred to the [[Woolwich]] [[Hulk (ship type)|prison hulk]] ''Justitia'', probably for [[discipline|disciplinary]] reasons. When the ''Justitia'' was destroyed by fire, he was transferred to the ''Defence''. About a year later, he boarded the prison ship ''[[Pyrenees (ship)|Pyrenees]]'' for [[penal transportation|transportation]] to what was then the British [[penal colony]] of [[Western Australia]] to serve out the remainder of his sentence.<ref name=\"Edgar 1990\"/> In turn, Williams was transported to [[Van Diemen's Land]] in March 1852.\n\n=== Australia bound ===\n[[File:Avon vally gnangarra-30.jpg|thumb|Remnants of Moondyne Joe's gate; it was this gate that he used to trap stock]]\n\n''Pyrenees'' sailed for Western Australia on 2 February 1853, and arrived in [[Fremantle]] on 30 April.<ref name=pyrenees>{{cite news|title=Shipping Intelligence|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page717342|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News|date=4 July 1851}}</ref> In reward for good behaviour, Johns was issued with a [[Ticket of leave#Australian convicts|ticket of leave]] on arrival, and on 10 March 1855 he received a conditional pardon. He then settled in the [[Avon River (Western Australia)|Avon]] Valley, one of the most rugged and inaccessible places in the [[Darling Scarp|Darling Range]]. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] name for the area was ''Moondyne''. Johns made a living by partly fencing the springs in the area, and trapping escaped stock and horses. Often a reward was offered for the return of such animals.<ref name=\"Edgar 1990\"/>\n\nIn August 1861, Johns caught an unbranded stallion and branded it with his own mark. This was effectively horse stealing, and when the police heard of this they arrested him at their first opportunity. The horse was taken as evidence, and Johns was placed in the [[Toodyay, Western Australia|Toodyay]] lockup. Sometime during the night, Johns broke out of his cell, and stole the horse once more, taking also the local magistrate's brand-new saddle and bridle. He was caught the next day but, while on the run, he had killed the horse and cut his brand out of the hide, thus destroying the evidence. Consequently, he received only a three-year sentence for jail-breaking, whereas a typical sentence for horse stealing was more than ten years.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\">{{cite book|author=Elliot, Ian|year=1978|title=Moondyne Joe: The Man and the Myth|location=Nedlands, Western Australia | publisher=University of Western Australia Press|isbn=0-85564-130-4}} Republished in 1998 by Carlisle, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. {{ISBN|0-85905-244-3}}.</ref>\n\nWhile Johns was serving his sentence, there was a rash of convict escapes and attempted escapes, but Johns remained well behaved. His good behaviour earned him a remission on his sentence, and he was released on a ticket of leave in February 1864. He then found work on Henry Martin's<!-- speculate this is the same Martin after whom the suburb in the same area is named--> farm in [[Kelmscott, Western Australia|Kelmscott]]. In January 1865, a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] named \"Bright\" belonging to William Wallace was killed, and Johns was accused of the deed. He was arrested on 29 March, found guilty on 5 July, and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3753477 |title=Supreme Court\u2014Criminal Side. |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and West Australian Times]] |date=7 July 1865 |accessdate=7 July 2017 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Johns was to protest his innocence of this crime for the rest of his life. He was determined not to serve what he felt was an unjust sentence and, in early November, he and another prisoner absconded from a work party. They were on the run for nearly a month, during which time they committed a number of small robberies. It was during this time that Johns first adopted the nickname ''Moondyne Joe''. They were finally caught {{Convert|37|km|abbr=off}} east of [[York, Western Australia|York]] by a party of policemen that included [[Tommy Windich]], an [[Aboriginal tracker]]. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Johns was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to [[Fremantle Prison]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Escape ===\nIn April 1866, Johns sent a petition to the [[Chief Justice of Western Australia|Chief Justice]], and received four years off his sentence. This was apparently unsatisfactory to him for, in July, he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door. Early in August, he succeeded in escaping again. After cutting off his irons, he met up with three other escapees, and together they roamed the bush around Perth, committing a number of robberies and narrowly escaping capture on a number of occasions. Near the end of the month, one of the gang was captured by police. Realising that the gang could not elude the police forever, Johns formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to the colony of South Australia. This would be a long and arduous journey through extremely arid land, and the gang would have to be very well equipped if it were to stand any chance of success. On 5 September, Johns equipped his company by committing the biggest robbery of his career, stealing supplies and equipment from the Toodyay store of an old enemy, James Everett. The gang then started travelling east along the explorer [[Charles Cooke Hunt|Charles Hunt]]'s established route. Their tracks were discovered by police on 26 September, about {{Convert|160|km}} east of York. A team of police then set out after them, and they were captured on 29 September 1866 at Boodalin Soak, about {{convert|6|km|spell=in}} north-west of the present-day site of the town of [[Westonia, Western Australia|Westonia]], approximately {{convert|300|km}} north-east of [[Perth]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n[[File:FremantleprisonMoondynescell.JPG|thumb|right|Moondyne Joe's \"escape-proof\" cell]]\n\n=== Hard labour ===\nAs punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Johns received five years' hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was sent to [[Fremantle Prison]], and kept in the yard with his neck chained to the iron bar of a window, while a special \"escape-proof\" cell was made for him. The stone-walled cell was lined with [[Eucalyptus marginata|jarrah]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] and over one thousand nails, and was almost air-proof and light-proof. Johns was kept in the cell on a bread and water diet, with only one to two hours of exercise a day. In early 1867, due to his diminishing health, Johns was set to work breaking stone in the open air but, rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder. [[Governor of Western Australia|Governor]] [[John Hampton]] was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\". However, the rock broken by Johns was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the [[limestone]] wall of the prison.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn 7 March 1867, Johns escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. Despite an extensive manhunt, no sign of him was found, and he would not be recaptured for nearly two years. He did not return to any of his old haunts, and he committed no crimes, so the authorities received very little information about him. Also, many convicts were encouraged by Johns' audacious escape, and a number of escapes were attempted in the following months, so that he was quickly forgotten.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\nOn the 25 February 1869, Johns tried to steal some wine from the cellars at [[Houghton Wines|Houghton Winery]]. By chance, the owner had been helping with a police search, and afterwards invited a group of police back to the vineyard for refreshments. When the owner entered the cellar, Johns assumed that he was discovered, and made a dash for the door into the arms of the police. He was returned to prison, sentenced to an additional 12 months, half to be in separate confinement, for absconding. On 22 March 1869 he was sentenced to an additional four years in irons for [[Burglary|breaking and entering]]. Johns made at least one more attempt to escape, attempting in February 1871 to create a key for his cell in the carpenter's workshop, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, in April 1871, Comptroller General Wakeford heard from Johns of Hampton's promise. After verifying with Superintendent Lefroy that those words were spoken, Wakeford informed the current governor, [[Frederick Weld]], who agreed that further punishment would be unfair. Johns was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\"/>\n\n=== Later life ===\nThe remainder of Johns' life consisted of periods of good behaviour punctuated by occasional minor misdemeanors and brief jail terms. In January 1879, he married a widow named Louisa Hearn, and they spent some time prospecting for gold near [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]]. In 1881, while exploring the countryside around [[Karridale, Western Australia|Karridale]], he discovered [[Moondyne Cave]].\n\n=== Final years and death ===\nIn 1893, Johns' wife Louisa died at the age of 40, and the death affected him greatly. Years after, he began acting strangely, and was eventually found to be mentally ill. He died of senile [[dementia]] in the Fremantle Lunatic Asylum (now the [[Fremantle Arts Centre]] building) on 13 August 1900, and was buried in [[Fremantle Cemetery]].<ref name=\"Elliot 1978\" /> His tombstone bears the word \"rhyddid\", meaning \"freedom\" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n\n===Literature and film===\n[[File:John Boyle O'Reilly cph.3a38519.jpg|thumb|left|It has been said{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that the tales of Moondyne Joe inspired John Boyle O'Reilly to make his daring escape in 1869]]\n\nWhile Moondyne Joe was bushranging in 1869, an [[Ireland|Irish]] political prisoner named [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] was working in a convict road party near [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]]. Although it is very unlikely that O'Reilly knew Moondyne Joe, he must have heard many stories of his exploits. In March 1869, O'Reilly escaped and was rescued by an American ship. After his arrival in the United States, he wrote a novel about convict life called [[Moondyne|''Moondyne: An Australian Tale'']], whose central character was called Moondyne Joe.
