Its name literally means ''East-West Line''. The line runs between [[Nakano Station (Tokyo)|Nakano Station]] in [[Nakano, Tokyo]] and [[Nishi-Funabashi Station]] in [[Funabashi, Chiba]]. The T\u014dzai Line was referred to as Line 5 during the planning stages, thus the seldom-used official name is {{Nihongo|Line 5 T\u014dzai Line|5\u53f7\u7dda\u6771\u897f\u7dda|Go-g\u014d-sen T\u014dzai-sen}}. On average, the line carries 1,642,378 passengers daily (2017), the highest of all lines in the Tokyo Metro network.<ref name=\"trainmedia\">[http://www.train-media.net/report/1110/metro.pdf Tokyo Metro station ridership in 2017] ''Train Media (sourced from Tokyo Metro)'' Retrieved July 23, 2018.</ref> On maps, diagrams and signboards, the T\u014dzai Line is shown using the color \"sky blue\" ({{TSLS2|T}}), and its stations are given numbers using the letter \"T\".\n\n==Overview==\nThe T\u014dzai Line features [[through train|through services]] on both ends. Trains run through onto the [[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East)'s [[Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu Line]] for {{STN|Mitaka}} at the western end and onto the [[T\u014dy\u014d Rapid Railway Line]] for {{STN|T\u014dy\u014d-Katsutadai}} at the eastern end, making the line an alternative route to the Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu between {{STN|Nakano|Tokyo}} and {{STN|Nishi-Funabashi}}.\n\nAccording to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation]], as of June 2009 the Tokyo Metro T\u014dzai Line was the most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 199% capacity between {{STN|Kiba}} and {{STN|Monzen-Nakach\u014d}} stations.<ref>''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', [http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/794/page2.asp \"Commute\", June 12, 2009, p. 07.] Capacity is defined as all passengers having a seat or a strap or door railing to hold on to.</ref> [[Women-only passenger car|Women-only cars]] were introduced on the line during morning rush hours starting on November 20, 2006.\n\n==Services==\nThe T\u014dzai Line was the first Tokyo Metro line on which express services run: two types of rapid trains skip some stations east of Toyocho. The [[Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line]] began services on June 14, 2008 and also features express services.\n\nThrough services to {{STN|Mitaka}} via the JR East Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Local) and {{STN|T\u014dy\u014d-Katsutadai}} via the T\u014dy\u014d Rapid Railway run all day. During the morning and evening peak periods, through services run to {{STN|Tsudanuma}} via the JR East S\u014dbu Line (Local).\n\n== Station list ==\n*Local trains stop at every station.

Although this corridor is now served by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation]] (Toei) [[Toei Shinjuku Line|Shinjuku Line]] and JR [[Keiy\u014d Line]] as well, the T\u014dzai Line continues to operate beyond capacity due to its accessibility to other lines, as well as to growing [[condominium]] developments in eastern Tokyo.\n\nThe {{STN|Takadanobaba}} to {{STN|Kudanshita}} section opened in 1964, and the remainder opened in stages until its completion in 1969.

operated by [[Tokyo Metro]]. Its name literally means ''East-West Line''. The line runs between [[Nakano Station (Tokyo)|Nakano Station]] in [[Nakano, Tokyo]] and [[Nishi-Funabashi Station]] in [[Funabashi, Chiba]]. The T\u014dzai Line was referred to as Line 5 during the planning stages, thus the seldom-used official name is {{Nihongo|Line 5 T\u014dzai Line|5\u53f7\u7dda\u6771\u897f\u7dda|Go-g\u014d-sen T\u014dzai-sen}}. On average, the line carries 1,642,378 passengers daily (2017), the highest of all lines in the Tokyo Metro network<ref name=\"trainmedia\">[http://www.train-media.net/report/1110/metro.pdf Tokyo Metro station ridership in 2017] ''Train Media (sourced from Tokyo Metro)'' Retrieved July 23, 2018.</ref>. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the T\u014dzai Line is shown using the color \"sky blue\" ({{TSLS2|T}}), and its stations are given numbers using the letter \"T\".\n\n==Overview==\nThe T\u014dzai Line features [[through train|through services]] on both ends. Trains run through onto the [[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East)'s [[Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu Line]] for {{STN|Mitaka}} at the western end and onto the [[T\u014dy\u014d Rapid Railway Line]] for {{STN|T\u014dy\u014d-Katsutadai}} at the eastern end, making the line an alternative route to the Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu between {{STN|Nakano|Tokyo}} and {{STN|Nishi-Funabashi}}.\n\nAccording to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation]], as of June 2009 the Tokyo Metro T\u014dzai Line was the most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 199% capacity between {{STN|Kiba}} and {{STN|Monzen-Nakach\u014d}} stations.<ref>''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', [http://archive.metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/794/page2.asp \"Commute\", June 12, 2009, p. 07.] Capacity is defined as all passengers having a seat or a strap or door railing to hold on to.</ref> [[Women-only passenger car|Women-only cars]] were introduced on the line during morning rush hours starting on November 20, 2006.\n\n==Services==\nThe T\u014dzai Line was the first Tokyo Metro line on which express services run: two types of rapid trains skip some stations east of Toyocho. The [[Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line]] began services on June 14, 2008 and also features express services.\n\nThrough services to {{STN|Mitaka}} via the JR East Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Local) and {{STN|T\u014dy\u014d-Katsutadai}} via the T\u014dy\u014d Rapid Railway run all day. During the morning and evening peak periods, through services run to {{STN|Tsudanuma}} via the JR East S\u014dbu Line (Local).\n\n== Station list ==\n*Local trains stop at every station.

Its name literally means \"East-West Line\", and it was primarily planned to relieve traffic on the busy [[S\u014dbu Main Line]] as well as provide a straight crosstown connection through north-central Tokyo. Although this corridor is now served by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation]] (Toei) [[Toei Shinjuku Line|Shinjuku Line]] and JR [[Keiy\u014d Line]] as well, the T\u014dzai Line continues to operate beyond capacity due to its accessibility to other lines, as well as to growing [[condominium]] developments in eastern Tokyo.\n\nThe {{STN|Takadanobaba}} to {{STN|Kudanshita}} section opened in 1964, and the remainder opened in stages until its completion in 1969. Through service with the then [[Japanese National Railways]] (today part of the [[JR Group]]) \u2013 a first for a Tokyo subway line \u2013 began in 1969 connecting the Ch\u016b\u014d and S\u014dbu lines. This is a rare situation in Tokyo, as the only other subway line with through services onto JR lines is the [[Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line|Chiyoda Line]].\n\nThe [[T\u014dy\u014d Rapid Railway Line]], effectively an eastward extension of the line, opened in 1996.

It is [[List of Solar System objects by size#List of objects by radius|the fifth-largest]] satellite in the [[Solar System]], and by far<ref>{{cite book |last=Lowrie |first=William |date=1997 |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=5}}</ref> the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the [[planet]] that it orbits (its [[Primary (astronomy)|primary]]). The Moon is, after [[Jupiter]]'s satellite [[Io (moon)|Io]], the second-[[Density|densest]] satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known.\n\nThe Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51&nbsp;billion years ago, [[Age of the Earth|not long after Earth]]. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a [[giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact]] between Earth and a hypothetical [[Mars]]-sized body called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]]. New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/143025/the-moon-is-older-than-scientists-thought/ |title=The Moon is older than scientists thought |website=Universe Today}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon is in [[tidal locking|synchronous rotation]] with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the [[near side of the Moon|near side]]. Because of [[libration]], slightly more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm |title=Libration of the Moon |last=Stern |first=David |date=30 March 2014 |website=NASA |access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref> The near side is marked by dark volcanic [[lunar mare|maria]] that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent [[impact crater]]s. After the [[Sun]], the Moon is the [[List of brightest natural objects in the sky|second-brightest celestial object]] regularly visible in Earth's sky. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the [[night sky]] it appears very bright, with a [[reflectance]] just slightly higher than that of worn [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. Its gravitational influence produces the [[tide|ocean tides]], [[Earth tide|body tides]], and the [[tidal acceleration|slight lengthening]] of the day.\n\nThe Moon's average [[lunar distance (astronomy)|orbital distance]] is {{cvt|384402|km|mi}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |title=How far away is the moon? |work=Space Place |publisher=NASA |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006220531/http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Elaine |title=Our Moon: New discoveries about Earth's closest companion |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] Harcourt |year=2016 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-544-75058-6}}</ref> or 1.28&nbsp;light-seconds. This is about thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moon's [[angular diameter|apparent size]] in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400&nbsp;times the lunar distance and diameter. Therefore, the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely during a total [[solar eclipse]]. This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the [[timeline of the far future|far future]] because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually increasing.\n\nThe Moon was first reached by a human-made object in September 1959, when the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna 2]], an [[unmanned spacecraft]], was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. This accomplishment was followed by the first successful soft landing on the Moon by [[Luna 9]] in 1966. The [[United States]]' NASA [[Apollo program]] achieved the only manned lunar missions to date, beginning with the first manned orbital mission by [[Apollo 8]] in 1968, and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being [[Apollo 11]] in July&nbsp;1969. These missions returned [[Moon rock|lunar rocks]] which have been used to develop a [[Geology of the Moon|geological understanding]] of the [[Origin of the Moon|Moon's origin]], [[internal structure of the Moon|internal structure]], and the Moon's later history. Since the 1972 [[Apollo 17]] mission, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.\n\nBoth the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of [[lunar phases|phases]] as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial. Such cultural influences can be found in [[Moon#Name and etymology|language]], [[lunar calendar]] systems, [[Moon in fiction|art]], and [[lunar deity|mythology]].\n\n== Name and etymology ==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities}}\n[[File:Lunar eclipse October 8 2014 California Alfredo Garcia Jr mideclipse.JPG|thumb|The Moon, tinted reddish, during a [[lunar eclipse]]]]\n[[File:Two Lunar Phases.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|During the [[lunar phase]]s, only portions of the Moon can be observed from [[Earth]]]]\n\nThe usual [[English language|English]] proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply '''the Moon''', which  in nonscientific texts is usually not capitalized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |title=Naming Astronomical Objects: Spelling of Names |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=29 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024716/http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"PN-FAQ\" /> The noun ''moon'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''m\u014dna'', which (like all its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates) stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*m\u0113n\u014dn'',<ref>Vladimir Orel (2003) [https://archive.org/details/Orel-AHandbookOfGermanicEtymology/mode/2up/search/moon ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology,] Brill</ref> which in turn comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*m\u0113nsis'' \"month\"<ref>Fernando L\u00f3pez-Menchero, [https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/word.inc.php/ine/m%c4%93nsis Late Proto-Indo-European Etymological Lexicon]</ref> (from earlier ''*m\u0113n\u014dt'', genitive ''*m\u0113neses'') which may be related to the verb \"measure\" (of time).<ref name=\"barnhart1995\" />\n\nOccasionally, the name '''Luna''' {{IPAc-en|'|l|u\u02d0|n|\u0259}} is used in scientific writing<ref>E.g.

Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: \"You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon's birth.\" At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most consensual theory. <blockquote>Before the conference, there were partisans of the three \"traditional\" theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn't think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward, there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.<ref name=Dana-Mackenzie>{{cite book |author=Dana Mackenzie |title=The Big Splat, or How Our Moon Came to Be |url=https://archive.org/details/bigsplatorhowour00mack |url-access=registration |date=21 July 2003 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-0-471-48073-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bigsplatorhowour00mack/page/166 166]\u2013168 |df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nGiant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System.

Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface every 24 hours. The particles striking the Moon's surface eject Moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements were made by [[Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer|LADEE]]'s Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer Moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the [[Geminids|Geminid]], [[Quadrantids|Quadrantid]], [[Taurids|Northern Taurid]], and [[Omicron Centaurids|Omicron Centaurid]] [[meteor shower]]s, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris.

As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in [[tidal forces]]. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.\n\nThe most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. This results in elevated sea levels called [[tide|ocean tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> As the Earth spins on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place \"under\" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth. The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for [[Spring tide|spring and neap tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the [[inertia]] of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the sloshing of water between different ocean basins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Le Provost |first=C. |author2=Bennett, A.F. |author3=Cartwright, D.E. |date=1995 |title=Ocean Tides for and from TOPEX/POSEIDON |pages=639\u2013642 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pmid=17745840 |volume=267 |issue=5198 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..639L |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.639}}</ref> As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.\n\nWhile gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the Earth's fluid oceans, gravitational coupling between the Moon and Earth's solid body is mostly elastic and plastic. The result is a further tidal effect of the Moon on the Earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the Earth nearest the Moon that acts as a [[torque]] in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This \"drains\" [[angular momentum]] and rotational [[kinetic energy]] from Earth's spin, slowing the Earth's rotation.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /><ref name=\"touma1994\" /> That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process (confusingly known as [[tidal acceleration]]), which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the Earth.

The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth. The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles. This makes possible both [[total eclipse|total]] (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and [[annular eclipse|annular]] (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses.<ref>{{cite web |first=F. |last=Espenak |date=2000 |url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html |title=Solar Eclipses for Beginners |publisher=MrEclip]] |accessdate=17 March 2010}}</ref> In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the [[solar corona]] becomes visible to the [[naked eye]].

Also, as it evolves toward becoming a [[red giant]], the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing.{{efn|name=size changes}} The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible.

Philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person.<ref name=\"sciam\" /> Even today, people who believe in a [[lunar effect]] claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.<ref name=\"sciam\" /><ref name=\"RottonKelly1985\" /><ref name=\"MartensKelly1988\" /><ref name=\"kelly\" /><ref name=\"FosterRoenneberg2008\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notes\n |notes=\n {{efn |name=inclination\n |Between 18.29\u00b0 and 28.58\u00b0 to Earth's [[equator]].<ref name=\"W06\"/><!--Wieczorek et al. 2006; 18.29\u00b0 when the longitude of the Moon's ascending node is 180\u00b0, 28.58\u00b0 when it is 0\u00b0-->\n}}\n {{efn|name=maxval\n |The ''maximum value'' is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of \u221212.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378&nbsp;000&nbsp;km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth\u2013Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6&nbsp;378&nbsp;km, giving 350&nbsp;600&nbsp;km.

New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.<ref>https://www.universetoday.com/143025/the-moon-is-older-than-scientists-thought/ Universe Today</ref>\n\nThe Moon is in [[tidal locking|synchronous rotation]] with Earth, and thus always shows the same side to Earth, the [[near side of the Moon|near side]]. Because of [[libration]], slightly more than half (about 59%) of the total lunar surface can be viewed from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm|title=Libration of the Moon|last=Stern|first=David|date=30 March 2014|website=NASA|access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref> The near side is marked by dark volcanic [[lunar mare|maria]] that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent [[impact crater]]s. After the [[Sun]], the Moon is the [[List of brightest natural objects in the sky|second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky]]. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the [[night sky]] it appears very bright, with a [[reflectance]] just slightly higher than that of worn [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. Its gravitational influence produces the [[tide|ocean tides]], [[Earth tide|body tides]], and the [[tidal acceleration|slight lengthening]] of the day.\n\nThe Moon's average [[lunar distance (astronomy)|orbital distance]] is {{cvt|384402|km|mi}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |title=How far away is the moon? |work=Space Place |publisher=NASA |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006220531/http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/ |archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Elaine |title=Our Moon: New Discoveries About Earth's Closest Companion |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] Harcourt |year=2016 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-544-75058-6}}</ref> or 1.28 light-seconds. This is about thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moon's [[angular diameter|apparent size]] in the sky is almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400 times the lunar distance and diameter. Therefore, the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely during a total [[solar eclipse]]. This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the [[timeline of the far future|far future]] because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually increasing.\n\nThe Moon was first reached by a human-made object in September 1959, when the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna 2]], an [[unmanned spacecraft]], was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. This accomplishment was followed by the first successful soft landing on the Moon by [[Luna 9]] in 1966. The [[United States]]' NASA [[Apollo program]] achieved the only manned lunar missions to date, beginning with the first manned orbital mission by [[Apollo 8]] in 1968, and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being [[Apollo 11]] in July 1969. These missions returned [[Moon rock|lunar rocks]] which have been used to develop a [[Geology of the Moon|geological understanding]] of the [[Origin of the Moon|Moon's origin]], [[internal structure of the Moon|internal structure]], and the Moon's later history. Since the 1972 [[Apollo 17]] mission, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.\n\nBoth the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of [[lunar phases|phases]] as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for human societies and cultures since time immemorial. Such cultural influences can be found in [[Moon#Name and etymology|language]], [[lunar calendar]] systems, [[Moon in fiction|art]], and [[lunar deity|mythology]].\n\n== Name and etymology ==\n{{See also|List of lunar deities}}\n[[File:Lunar eclipse October 8 2014 California Alfredo Garcia Jr mideclipse.JPG|thumb|The Moon, tinted reddish, during a [[lunar eclipse]]]]\n[[File:Two Lunar Phases.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|During the [[lunar phase]]s, only portions of the Moon can be observed from [[Earth]]]]\n\nThe usual [[English language|English]] proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply '''the Moon''', which  in nonscientific texts is usually not capitalized.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |title=Naming Astronomical Objects: Spelling of Names |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=29 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024716/http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"PN-FAQ\" /> The noun ''moon'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''m\u014dna'', which (like all its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates) stems from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*m\u0113n\u014dn'',<ref>Vladimir Orel (2003) [https://archive.org/details/Orel-AHandbookOfGermanicEtymology/mode/2up/search/moon ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology,] Brill</ref> which in turn comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*m\u0113nsis'' \"month\"<ref>Fernando L\u00f3pez-Menchero, [https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/word.inc.php/ine/m%c4%93nsis Late Proto-Indo-European Etymological Lexicon]</ref> (from earlier ''*m\u0113n\u014dt'', genitive ''*m\u0113neses'') which may be related to the verb \"measure\" (of time).<ref name=\"barnhart1995\" />\n\nOccasionally, the name '''Luna''' {{IPAc-en|'|l|u\u02d0|n|\u0259}} is used in scientific writing<ref>E.g.

Eighteen months prior to an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: \"You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon's birth.\" At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most consensual theory. <blockquote>Before the conference, there were partisans of the three \"traditional\" theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn't think the debate would ever be resolved.

As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in [[tidal forces]]. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.\n\nThe most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. This results in elevated sea levels called [[tide|ocean tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> As the Earth spins on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place \"under\" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth. The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for [[Spring tide|spring and neap tides]].<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /> If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the [[inertia]] of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the sloshing of water between different ocean basins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Le Provost |first=C. |author2=Bennett, A.F. |author3=Cartwright, D.E. |date=1995 |title=Ocean Tides for and from TOPEX/POSEIDON |pages=639\u2013642 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pmid=17745840 |volume=267 |issue=5198 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..639L |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.639}}</ref> As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.\n\nWhile gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the Earth's fluid oceans, gravitational coupling between the Moon and Earth's solid body is mostly elastic and plastic. The result is a further tidal effect of the Moon on the Earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the Earth nearest the Moon that acts as a [[torque]] in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This \"drains\" [[angular momentum]] and rotational [[kinetic energy]] from Earth's spin, slowing the Earth's rotation.<ref name=\"Lambeck1977\" /><ref name=\"touma1994\" /> That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process (confusingly known as [[tidal acceleration]]), which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the Earth.
