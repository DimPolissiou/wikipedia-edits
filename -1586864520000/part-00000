Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the [[United States]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[East India|Eastern India]], but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern [[Canada]] during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Australia]]. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of [[severe weather]], including strong [[thunderstorm]]s, strong winds, and [[hail]].\n\nIn 2006, there were 1,333 reported tornadoes in the US (of which 1,103 tornadoes were confirmed), with 67 reported fatalities (about half of those recorded in [[Tennessee]]).<ref>http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/tornado06.pdf</ref> In addition, four other tornado-related deaths were reported in Europe - all of them in [[Germany]] where 119 tornadoes were confirmed,<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914152425/http://www.tornadoliste.de/tornadoliste2006.htm Tornadoliste Deutschland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 12 deaths in [[Japan]], eight deaths in [[China]], three deaths in [[Vietnam]], and one tornado fatality has been reported in [[Canada]], in the province of [[Manitoba]] for a worldwide total of 94.\n\n==Synopsis==\nNovember 2005 was very active for tornadoes across the United States, with three large outbreaks and one additional significant tornado (see the [[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]). For much of December 2005; a cold, stable [[Arctic]] [[air mass]] prevailed over much of the United States east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. However, by the start of the new year the pattern began to reverse itself, and moist, unstable air once again flowed northward from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (a pattern normally reserved for spring) and combined with a series of strong [[low pressure systems]] tracking across the country, conditions were present for tornado formation.\n\nThe formation had led to an enormous upswing in tornado activity in the early spring, and the tornado reports were at record pace, with nearly continuous activity for an eight-week period throughout March and April, similar to the pace of [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] activity in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]].\n\nActivity slowed down in May with fewer tornadoes overall spread out over a much larger area due to less favorable conditions. The air became somewhat more stable and wind shear decreased, despite the large number of storms that tracked across the US. Since then, activity has been generally fairly low, with no major outbreaks anywhere in the summer of 2006, although the actual number of tornadoes has been moderate. However, in [[Canada]] a series of strong low pressure systems, combined with high heat and humidity had led to numerous severe weather events across the country with several tornadoes occurring in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].\n\nThe fall severe weather season began unusually early, with a moderate event in mid-September followed by a significant outbreak in the latter part of the month. After that, activity slowed down with few significant tornadoes in October and early November. However, several significant events took place in the second half of November into December, to end 2006.\n\nThe most severe tornadoes reported were two F4 tornadoes. They took place on March 12 in [[Monroe City, Missouri]] and on September 22 in [[Crosstown, Missouri]]. The deadliest single tornado was on April 2 in [[Newbern, Tennessee]] where 16 people were killed (out of 29 in the outbreak). The most destructive tornado outside the US was on November 7 in [[Saroma, Hokkaido]], Japan, where nine people died.\n\n==Events==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 1103\n|F0 = 686\n|F1 = 292\n|F2 = 93\n|F3 = 30\n|F4 = 2\n|F5 = 0\n\n|Enhanced=no\n\n}}\n\n===January===\nThere were 43 tornadoes reported in the US in January.

Two major clusters of tornadic [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed, one in central [[Kentucky]] and one in western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. 19 confirmed tornadoes touched down. This outbreak produced a few strong tornadoes, including an F2 that hit the west side of [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]]. An F3 caused major damage near [[Zebulon, Georgia]] as well. Fortunately there were only a few minor injuries.\n\nDamages from the tornadoes totaled $7.452 million.\n{{clear}}\n\n====January 11====\n{{Infobox storm\n|event=January 11\n|fujitascale=F1\n|enhanced=\n|tornadoes=2\n|areas affected=[[Virginia]]\n}}\n{{Tornado chart small| F0 = 0| F1 = 2| F2 = 0| F3 = 0| F4 = 0| F5 = 0| Enhanced = }}\n\nIn the final review of 2006, two isolated tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in [[Virginia]].

A rotating [[supercell]] embedded within the squall line produced an F2 tornado in [[Yell County, Arkansas]]. The next day, several tornadoes developed from supercells that evolved from the remnants of the squall line across the southeastern states, with the first tornado-inflicted death of 2006 in an F1 tornado near [[Belleville, Alabama]] as well as about a dozen students injured at a damaged school in [[Baker, Florida]].

The western suburbs, particularly [[Kenner, Louisiana|Kenner]], took most of the hits. Several homes were heavily damaged, most of them already damaged by Katrina but suffering additional damage. [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|Louis Armstrong International Airport]] took a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, which caused more damage than was done by the hurricane several months earlier.

Over those five days, there were 99 tornadoes confirmed out of as many as 160 tornadoes reported. 27 of them were considered \"strong\" (F2-F3) and one was considered \"violent\" (F4-F5) The majority (62) of the tornadoes occurred on March 12, particularly in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. At least 13 deaths were blamed on the severe weather,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} 11 as a result of tornadoes.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\">[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/2006deadlytorn.html 2006 Tornado Fatality Information] [[Storm Prediction Center]].  Accessed May 11, 2008.</ref>\n\nMost of the activity on March 9 took the form of a serial [[derecho]], although eight tornadoes were reported. At least two people were killed that day in storms, but not in tornadoes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There was little activity on March 10, but it picked up again on March 11 with 18 tornadoes in the mid-[[Mississippi Valley]].  Two people were killed near [[Saint Mary, Missouri]] when their truck was thrown into a propane tank.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/>\n\nThe main outbreak took place on March 12, with at least 62 tornadoes, including most of the strong tornadoes and the only violent one, and nine fatalities.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> Activity continued farther south over [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] on March 13 with 15 weak (F0-F1) tornadoes before the outbreak finally ended.\n\n====March 19\u201320====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[South Central United States]] on March 19 and March 20, with one tornado in [[Texas]] and several in [[Mississippi]] and [[Oklahoma]].\n\nThe strongest tornado (and first of the event) took place in [[Uvalde, Texas]] late on March 19, where an F2 tornado touched down. Severe damage was reported in the community, and several homes were destroyed, including mobile homes. Remarkably, no injuries were reported. The tornado damage was difficult to distinguish from the damage reported as a result of [[microburst]]s in the area which had winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h). It was the strongest tornado in the region since October 2001.\n\nA total of six tornadoes were reported on March 20. Two took place in Oklahoma and four in Mississippi. All were rated F0 or F1 and damage was generally minor.\n\n====March 23====\n\nAn extremely rare tornado touched down in [[Hawaii]] late on March 23, on the island of [[Lanai]]. It occurred at about 9:35&nbsp;p.m. [[Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Time|HAST]] (0735 UTC), and little damage was reported from the F0 tornado. It was only notable because of its unusual location.\n\nTornadoes are very rare in Hawaii; since 1950 there have been only 34 tornadoes in the state. The strongest was an F2 tornado on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] in 1971.\n\n====March 27 (Europe)====\n\nA line of thunderstorms with some supercells tracked across the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Germany]], spawning tornadoes in Germany, including one that tracked through the southern section of [[Hamburg]] at about 7:00&nbsp;p.m. local time (1700 [[UTC]]) on March 27. The tornadoes killed two people who were caught on [[construction]] [[crane (machine)|crane]]s when the tornado hit. 300,000 people also lost [[electricity]] as a result of the storms. Damage was reported to be significant, including flipped cars and major roof damage to numerous houses. [[Rail transport|Rail]] traffic was also halted temporarily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/stormcenter/2006-03-28-germany-tornado_x.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | title=Tornado kills two in Hamburg, Germany | date=March 28, 2006 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> Damage was estimated at several million [[euro]]s.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=26&story_id=28827&name=Two+dead,+road+chaos+as+Hamburg+hit+by+tornado Two dead, road chaos as Hamburg hit by tornado - Expatica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> No [[Fujita scale]] rating was officially assigned.

There were 24 tornadoes reported, of which 12 were confirmed. However, most touched down in rural areas and there have only been isolated damage reports. One person died six months later, and five others were injured. Many more reports of straight-line winds, [[microburst]]s and large hail (as large as [[baseball]]s) were reported.\n\nThere were three tornadoes of note.

There were no less than 66 confirmed tornadoes. Damage was widespread in dozens of communities, in addition to very strong microbursts of winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) and hail as large as [[softball]]s. The hardest-hit area was [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer]] and [[Gibson County, Tennessee|Gibson]] counties in [[Tennessee]], where at least 24 people were killed.\n\nThere was a moderate risk of severe weather on April 3 in the [[southeastern United States]] as the line was expected to refire.

Another fatality was reported in [[Marion County, Alabama]].\n\nThe [[Storm Prediction Center]] had issued a rare high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and 7, with an unprecedented 60% probability of a tornado within 25 miles of a point south of the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] area.<ref>[http://spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2006/day1otlk_20060407_2000.html Storm Prediction Center April 7, 2006 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====April 13\u201319====\n{{main|Easter Week 2006 tornado outbreak sequence}}\n\nOn April 13, a complex of severe thunderstorms formed in eastern [[Iowa]], bringing many reports of large hail along with reports of strong tornadoes, some with debris. It was unexpected, as the SPC issued only a slight risk of severe weather and never issued a [[tornado watch]]. The worst impacts were felt in and around [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], where an F2 caused significant damage.\n\nA steady stream of severe weather occurred for several days in the upper [[Mississippi Valley]], lower [[Great Lakes]], and [[Ohio Valley]] regions over the Easter weekend. A moderate risk of severe weather was in place for Saturday, April 15 in parts of Iowa and [[Nebraska]]. Moderate risks of severe weather were also issued for parts of central [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]] on [[Good Friday]], April 14 and [[Easter Sunday]], April 16. There were five to twenty reports of tornadoes each day.\n\nScattered tornadoes causing relatively light damage continued on April 17, 18, and 19.\n\n====April 21\u201322====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[Deep South]] late in the evening of April 21 and early on April 22 along a cold front. There were several tornadoes reported, but all of them were relatively weak. No injuries were reported.\n\n====April 24====\nOn April 24, a small tornado event spawned at least two tornadoes in northeastern and central [[Oklahoma]], causing some moderate damage particularly around [[Oklahoma City]]. No injuries were reported. There were some spectacular television images captured, including footage of a rare anti-cyclonic tornado in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]].\n\n====April 28\u201329====\nA small tornado event developed primarily in [[Texas]] and southern [[Oklahoma]] on April 28, although it was primarily a derecho event. There was also an isolated tornado in [[Louisiana]] on April 29.\n\nThere were at least nine reported tornadoes in the area on April 28<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060428_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060428's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and 29<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060429_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060429's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> along with numerous reports of significant wind damage.

Two main clusters - one over [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and the other primarily in [[South Dakota]] - produced a total of 10 reported tornadoes, along with powerful straight-line winds of up to 86&nbsp;mph (139&nbsp;km/h) and hail up to softball-sized. Damage was sporadic in the region, with isolated pockets of varying degrees of damage. No injuries were reported.\n\nSeveral more tornadoes developed on May 3 and again on May 4 across the same regions, but damage was relatively minor.\n\nThe activity became somewhat more severe once again on May 5 across Texas. There were 18 reported tornadoes and many reports of wind and hail damage. One person was injured. A strong storm formed over the [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] area in the late hours of the night of May 5, and early morning hours of May 6. This storm spawned a single tornado with damage rated as an F2 on the [[Fujita Scale]].\n\n====May 9\u201310====\nIn early May 2006, a widespread but mostly minor tornado outbreak took place across portions of the [[United States]]. The event began on the 9th with a few  scattered weak tornadoes touching down in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Alabama]], all of which were rated F0.<ref name=\"Storm Events Database\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?beginDate_mm=05&beginDate_dd=09&beginDate_yyyy=2006&endDate_mm=05&endDate_dd=10&endDate_yyyy=2006&eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&submitbutton=Search&statefips=-999%2CALL |title=Storm Events Database |website=NCDC |publisher=NCDC |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Later that evening, additional tornado activity began to occur in [[Texas]]. An F2 struck the north side of [[Childress, Texas]], resulting in considerable damage. Many trees along the path were snapped and uprooted, roofs of homes were damaged, and sheds were overturned in residential areas. As the tornado struck Childress High School, the gymnasium lost its roof and sustained total collapse of a large brick wall. Three air conditioning units were blown off the roof of the school, and two of them were blown from southeast to northwest, landing 90 to 200 feet from the school. A nearby nursing home was also damaged. At Fair Park, a tennis court was destroyed, several metal light poles were bent and snapped, and a pedestrian bridge that spanned a small lake was ripped from its wooden supports and thrown. An industrial storage building that housed emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with steel beams twisted. One person in town was injured by a falling tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/?n=events-2006-20060509_storms_tor |title=9 MAY 2006 SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS and TORNADO EVENT |website=NWS Lubbock, TX |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Further south, a powerful tornado passed north of [[Westminster, Texas]] and caused major damage in rural areas outside of town.

While the bulk of the damage was due to large hail, there were at least 17 tornadoes reported (of which seven were confirmed), with the most severe one taking place near [[Concord, North Carolina]]. Significant structural damage was reported in the area, including roofs blown off houses.

It was part of a longer [[squall line]] that resulted in significant damage and many injuries along with one death.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n====May 21====\n\nThe first significant tornado in the [[Northeastern United States]] took place on May 21. It was an isolated event in [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire]] and was confirmed to have been an F2 tornado.\n\nDamage was significant along a narrow path, primarily to trees and vehicles along [[Interstate 95 in New Hampshire|Interstate 95]] in the area. Two people were injured.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGYX All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====May 24\u201325====\n\nA strong front developed over the [[Upper Midwest]] on May 24 and extended along the [[Mississippi Valley]]. It was primarily a straight-line wind event, although there were at least five tornadoes reported, some of which produced significant damage.\n\nA greater risk of tornadic activity was issued by the SPC on May 25 for a large swath from the [[Great Lakes]] to the central [[Mississippi Valley]]. The event turned into a derecho with hundreds of severe wind damage reports, but only six tornado reports. There were no tornado-related injuries, but at least one person was injured by straight-line winds.\n\n====May 30\u201331====\n\nA hot and humid air mass entered the northeastern part of the U.S as well as much of southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and severe thunderstorms and tornadoes were sparked by a cold front. Numerous severe weather events were reported across [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] - primarily damaging wind and hail events - when a storm system crossed the area during these two days.\n\nOn May 31 there were at least 6 reports of tornadoes in Indiana and Illinois with no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. Also, [[Lanark County, Ontario|Lanark County]] in eastern [[Ontario]] had two tornado warnings in a span of 18 hours, with the threat of a strong tornado on the evening of May 30. While damage was reported near [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] southwest of [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]] due to straight-line damaging winds, there were no immediate reports of tornadoes despite rotation inside two distinct supercells detected by radar.\n\n===June===\nThere were 139 confirmed tornadoes in the US in June.\n\n====June 5\u20137====\n\nA low pressure system over the northern Plains and a cold front triggered a small tornado outbreak. 17 tornadoes were reported in the [[Dakotas]], eastern [[Iowa]] and southwestern [[Wisconsin]] during these two days (of which at least seven were confirmed), 14 of them occurring on June 6. Two tornadoes were located near [[Barneveld, Wisconsin]], which was the site of an F5 tornado almost the same day in 1984. Both tornadoes were an F0.<ref>[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=060606_tor June 6, 2006 Tornadoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with damage especially confined to trees, although one home was damaged. There were no reported injuries.  There was another tornado in [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk]] and [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia]] counties in Wisconsin, an [[Fujita scale|F1]].\n\nA separate system had reportedly spawned a tornado which inflicted damage to numerous houses near [[Seymour, Indiana]] north of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], but it was confirmed to have been a [[microburst]].\n\n====June 10====\nMore widespread severe weather occurred in the Central Plains with over 100 reports, mostly wind and hail events including reports of [[hurricane force]] wind-gusts. Tornadoes were confined especially in Nebraska where a mobile home and a barn were damaged and trailer was overturned near [[Gordon, Nebraska]]. There was also significant damage to trees and powerlines in [[New Florence, Missouri]] west of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\n====June 11\u201314: Tropical Storm Alberto====\n{{main|Tropical Storm Alberto (2006)}}\nTropical Storm Alberto made landfall on June 13, but was producing squalls well before then. Alberto's bands produced a small tornado event in the [[southeastern United States]]. There were 16 tornadoes reported; four in [[Florida]], three in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], six in [[South Carolina]] and three in [[North Carolina]]. At least seven of the tornadoes were confirmed; one was an F1 and the rest were F0.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/prodsByState.php?state=SC&prodtype=public Public Information - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One person suffered minor injuries in one of the tornadoes.<ref>\"[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060612_rpts.html SPC Storm Reports for 6/12/06].\" ''[[National Weather Service]]/Storm Prediction Center.''

There were at least 17 wind reports exceeding 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) with significant local damage. The heaviest of the activity occurred in [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. Despite the severity of the storms, only four tornadoes were reported in Kansas and three were confirmed; one was an F0 and the other two were F1, all in [[Sherman County, Kansas|Sherman County]].<ref>[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGLD All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====June 18\u201319====\n\nA warm and humid air mass was covering much of the eastern U.S. as well as [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] during this period of severe weather. With the passage of a [[cold front]] and instability, it created a wide area of severe thunderstorms, some as [[supercell]]s and others as [[squall line]]s, which created numerous damage in several U.S. cities as well as important Canadian cities such as [[Ottawa]], [[Sherbrooke]] and [[Granby, Quebec]].\n\nFirst, an unexpected tornado touched down in [[Hartford, Wisconsin]] in the middle of a rain storm with few other storm reports on June 18. Over 50 buildings were reported to have been damaged. Three people were injured by what turned out to be an F1 tornado.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGRB All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Meanwhile, in [[Pembroke, Ontario]] further to the east, what was possibly a tornado but confirmed as a [[microburst]], several roofs including one from a marina and another one from a large warehouse were blown away during the passage of a [[supercell]] storm.\n\nOn June 19, a widespread severe weather event took place throughout the [[Great Lakes]] region and into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. There were no confirmed tornadoes in the US that day, but two were confirmed in [[Ontario]], Canada. One tornado touched down just north of [[Stratford, Ontario]]; it was an F1 and caused moderate damage. A second tornado near [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] occurred late Sunday evening and also rated F1, with a storage shed completely destroyed.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on Ontario - Special Weather Statements - Environment Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230120330/http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on |date=2006-12-30 }}</ref>\n\n====June 21\u201324====\n\nOn the first day of summer, June 21, a significant severe weather outbreak began to develop in much of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and adjacent areas of [[Ontario]]. The most severe weather took place along the [[Interstate 90|I-90]] corridor and around [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, where tornadoes were reported. Another tornado was reported southwest of [[Detroit]] inside a massive cluster of severe thunderstorms that passed through the area in the early evening. However, the tornado did little damage; most of the damage in southeast Michigan was due to straight-line winds.\n\nAnother area of severe weather spawned numerous possible tornadoes in [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Colorado]], with severe weather reports also occurring in [[Iowa]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Missouri]] and [[Nebraska]].\n\nThree people were injured as a result of a landfalling [[waterspout]] in [[Charlotte County, Florida]] in a separate and isolated event. It also damaged numerous homes and destroyed several mobile homes. It was confirmed that there were two tornadoes; one was an F2 and one was an F0.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KTBW All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMore severe weather took place the following day in areas slightly farther south than the previous day's activity. Again, it was primarily a straight-line wind event, with at least 250 wind reports from [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Kentucky]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[West Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] with additional reports from the [[Carolinas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nA small tornado outbreak occurred in two distinct areas: the Southern Plains and the [[Ohio Valley]]. 19 tornadoes were reported - five of them in [[Elbert County, Colorado]] (one was confirmed, destroying a house under construction), likely from the same supercell and five from northwest Ohio in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and [[Van Wert County, Ohio|Van Wert]] counties. Two of the Van Wert County tornadoes were rated F0 (in [[Willshire, Ohio|Willshire]] and [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]]) and another F1 (also in Willshire) while one of the tornadoes in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen County]] was rated F1 with damage limited to sheds and roofs near [[Beaverdam, Ohio|Beaverdam]].<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060622_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060622's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another F0 would hit Willshire the following day.

Another tornado was reported in [[Notre-Dame du Laus, Quebec]] north of [[Gatineau]] and [[Ottawa]]. However, the multiple tree and trailer damage was caused by a [[microburst]] embedded inside a powerful [[progressive derecho]].\n\nAt least two deaths and numerous injuries were reported; however they resulted from the wider derecho, not the tornado events embedded within it.\n\n====July 19\u201320====\n\nA similar pattern to the previous event shaped up over parts of the [[Upper Midwest]], although the risk of tornadoes was initially declared even greater. The greatest risk on July 19 was over southern [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]], spreading eastward over [[Michigan]], southern [[Ontario]] and into the north-central [[Appalachians]] on July 20. The risk extends as far south as roughly the [[Interstate 70]] corridor.\n\nA moderate risk of severe weather had been declared by the SPC for July 19. A cluster of storms did develop in the late afternoon and early evening hours in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]] with additional activity in Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. Three tornadoes were reported including a [[derecho]] that formed in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] metro area with heavy damage to trees and power lines, knocking out power to over 500,000 people. The other reports came from Illinois.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the [[United States]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[East India|Eastern India]], but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern [[Canada]] during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Australia]]. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of [[severe weather]], including strong [[thunderstorm]]s, strong winds, and [[hail]].\n\nIn 2006, there were 1,333 reported tornadoes in the US (of which 1,103 tornadoes were confirmed), with 67 reported fatalities (about half of those recorded in [[Tennessee]]).<ref>http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats/tornado06.pdf</ref> In addition, four other tornado-related deaths were reported in Europe - all of them in [[Germany]] where 119 tornadoes were confirmed,<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914152425/http://www.tornadoliste.de/tornadoliste2006.htm Tornadoliste Deutschland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 12 deaths in [[Japan]], eight deaths in [[China]], three deaths in [[Vietnam]], and one tornado fatality has been reported in [[Canada]], in the province of [[Manitoba]] for a worldwide total of 94.\n\n==Synopsis==\nNovember 2005 was very active for tornadoes across the United States, with three large outbreaks and one additional significant tornado (see the [[List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks]]). For much of December 2005; a cold, stable [[Arctic]] [[air mass]] prevailed over much of the United States east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. However, by the start of the new year the pattern began to reverse itself, and moist, unstable air once again flowed northward from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (a pattern normally reserved for spring) and combined with a series of strong [[low pressure systems]] tracking across the country, conditions were present for tornado formation.\n\nThe formation had led to an enormous upswing in tornado activity in the early spring, and the tornado reports were at record pace, with nearly continuous activity for an eight-week period throughout March and April, similar to the pace of [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] activity in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]].\n\nActivity slowed down in May with fewer tornadoes overall spread out over a much larger area due to less favorable conditions. The air became somewhat more stable and wind shear decreased, despite the large number of storms that tracked across the US. Since then, activity has been generally fairly low, with no major outbreaks anywhere in the summer of 2006, although the actual number of tornadoes has been moderate. However, in [[Canada]] a series of strong low pressure systems, combined with high heat and humidity had led to numerous severe weather events across the country with several tornadoes occurring in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].\n\nThe fall severe weather season began unusually early, with a moderate event in mid-September followed by a significant outbreak in the latter part of the month. After that, activity slowed down with few significant tornadoes in October and early November. However, several significant events took place in the second half of November into December, to end 2006.\n\nThe most severe tornadoes reported were two F4 tornadoes. They took place on March 12 in [[Monroe City, Missouri]] and on September 22 in [[Crosstown, Missouri]]. The deadliest single tornado was on April 2 in [[Newbern, Tennessee]] where 16 people were killed (out of 29 in the outbreak). The most destructive tornado outside the US was on November 7 in [[Saroma, Hokkaido]], Japan, where nine people died.\n\n==Events==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 1103\n|F0 = 686\n|F1 = 292\n|F2 = 93\n|F3 = 30\n|F4 = 2\n|F5 = 0\n\n|Enhanced=no\n\n}}\n\n===January===\nThere were 43 tornadoes reported in the US in January.

Two major clusters of tornadic [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed, one in central [[Kentucky]] and one in western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. 19 confirmed tornadoes touched down. This outbreak produced a few strong tornadoes, including an F2 that hit the west side of [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]]. An F3 caused major damage near [[Zebulon, Georgia]] as well.

At least two people were killed that day in storms, but not in tornadoes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There was little activity on March 10, but it picked up again on March 11 with 18 tornadoes in the mid-[[Mississippi Valley]].  Two people were killed near [[Saint Mary, Missouri]] when their truck was thrown into a propane tank.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/>\n\nThe main outbreak took place on March 12, with at least 62 tornadoes, including most of the strong tornadoes and the only violent one, and nine fatalities.<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> Activity continued farther south over [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] on March 13 with 15 weak (F0-F1) tornadoes before the outbreak finally ended.\n\n====March 19\u201320====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[South Central United States]] on March 19 and March 20, with one tornado in [[Texas]] and several in [[Mississippi]] and [[Oklahoma]].\n\nThe strongest tornado (and first of the event) took place in [[Uvalde, Texas]] late on March 19, where an F2 tornado touched down. Severe damage was reported in the community, and several homes were destroyed, including mobile homes. Remarkably, no injuries were reported. The tornado damage was difficult to distinguish from the damage reported as a result of [[microburst]]s in the area which had winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h). It was the strongest tornado in the region since October 2001.\n\nA total of six tornadoes were reported on March 20. Two took place in Oklahoma and four in Mississippi. All were rated F0 or F1 and damage was generally minor.\n\n====March 23====\n\nAn extremely rare tornado touched down in [[Hawaii]] late on March 23, on the island of [[Lanai]]. It occurred at about 9:35&nbsp;p.m. [[Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Time|HAST]] (0735 UTC), and little damage was reported from the F0 tornado. It was only notable because of its unusual location.\n\nTornadoes are very rare in Hawaii; since 1950 there have been only 34 tornadoes in the state. The strongest was an F2 tornado on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] in 1971.\n\n====March 27 (Europe)====\n\nA line of thunderstorms with some supercells tracked across the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and [[Germany]], spawning tornadoes in Germany, including one that tracked through the southern section of [[Hamburg]] at about 7:00&nbsp;p.m. local time (1700 [[UTC]]) on March 27. The tornadoes killed two people who were caught on [[construction]] [[crane (machine)|crane]]s when the tornado hit. 300,000 people also lost [[electricity]] as a result of the storms. Damage was reported to be significant, including flipped cars and major roof damage to numerous houses.

There were no less than 66 confirmed tornadoes. Damage was widespread in dozens of communities, in addition to very strong microbursts of winds as strong as 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) and hail as large as [[softball]]s. The hardest-hit area was [[Dyer County, Tennessee|Dyer]] and [[Gibson County, Tennessee|Gibson]] counties in [[Tennessee]], where at least 24 people were killed.\n\nThere was a moderate risk of severe weather on April 3 in the [[southeastern United States]] as the line was expected to refire. However, no tornadoes were reported, just straight-line wind damage.\n\n====April 6\u20138====\n{{main|April 6\u20138, 2006 Tornado Outbreak}}\n\nThe third major tornado outbreak occurred over the Central and Southern United States on April 6 and 7, and lasted into early April 8. At least 62 tornadoes were confirmed out of over 80 reported tornadoes. The hardest hit region was the [[Middle Tennessee]] area, where 10 deaths (seven in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]], three near [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]])<ref name=\"SPC killer tornadoes\"/> and heavy damage were reported. Another fatality was reported in [[Marion County, Alabama]].\n\nThe [[Storm Prediction Center]] had issued a rare high risk for severe weather for both April 6 and 7, with an unprecedented 60% probability of a tornado within 25 miles of a point south of the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] area.<ref>[http://spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2006/day1otlk_20060407_2000.html Storm Prediction Center April 7, 2006 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====April 13\u201319====\n{{main|Easter Week 2006 Tornado Outbreak Sequence}}\n\nOn April 13, a complex of severe thunderstorms formed in eastern [[Iowa]], bringing many reports of large hail along with reports of strong tornadoes, some with debris. It was unexpected, as the SPC issued only a slight risk of severe weather and never issued a [[tornado watch]]. The worst impacts were felt in and around [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], where an F2 caused significant damage.\n\nA steady stream of severe weather occurred for several days in the upper [[Mississippi Valley]], lower [[Great Lakes]], and [[Ohio Valley]] regions over the Easter weekend. A moderate risk of severe weather was in place for Saturday, April 15 in parts of Iowa and [[Nebraska]]. Moderate risks of severe weather were also issued for parts of central [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]] on [[Good Friday]], April 14 and [[Easter Sunday]], April 16. There were five to twenty reports of tornadoes each day.\n\nScattered tornadoes causing relatively light damage continued on April 17, 18, and 19.\n\n====April 21\u201322====\n\nA small tornado event took place in the [[Deep South]] late in the evening of April 21 and early on April 22 along a cold front. There were several tornadoes reported, but all of them were relatively weak. No injuries were reported.\n\n====April 24====\nOn April 24, a small tornado event spawned at least two tornadoes in northeastern and central [[Oklahoma]], causing some moderate damage particularly around [[Oklahoma City]]. No injuries were reported. There were some spectacular television images captured, including footage of a rare anti-cyclonic tornado in [[El Reno, Oklahoma]].\n\n====April 28\u201329====\nA small tornado event developed primarily in [[Texas]] and southern [[Oklahoma]] on April 28, although it was primarily a derecho event. There was also an isolated tornado in [[Louisiana]] on April 29.\n\nThere were at least nine reported tornadoes in the area on April 28<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060428_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060428's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and 29<ref>[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/060429_rpts.html Storm Prediction Center 20060429's Storm Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> along with numerous reports of significant wind damage.

Two main clusters - one over [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and the other primarily in [[South Dakota]] - produced a total of 10 reported tornadoes, along with powerful straight-line winds of up to 86&nbsp;mph (139&nbsp;km/h) and hail up to softball-sized. Damage was sporadic in the region, with isolated pockets of varying degrees of damage. No injuries were reported.\n\nSeveral more tornadoes developed on May 3 and again on May 4 across the same regions, but damage was relatively minor.\n\nThe activity became somewhat more severe once again on May 5 across Texas. There were 18 reported tornadoes and many reports of wind and hail damage. One person was injured. A strong storm formed over the [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] area in the late hours of the night of May 5, and early morning hours of May 6. This storm spawned a single tornado with damage rated as an F2 on the [[Fujita Scale]].\n\n====May 9\u201310====\nIn early May 2006, a widespread but mostly minor tornado outbreak took place across portions of the [[United States]]. The event began on the 9th with a few  scattered weak tornadoes touching down in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Alabama]], all of which were rated F0.<ref name=\"Storm Events Database\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/listevents.jsp?beginDate_mm=05&beginDate_dd=09&beginDate_yyyy=2006&endDate_mm=05&endDate_dd=10&endDate_yyyy=2006&eventType=%28C%29+Tornado&submitbutton=Search&statefips=-999%2CALL |title=Storm Events Database |website=NCDC |publisher=NCDC |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Later that evening, additional tornado activity began to occur in [[Texas]]. An F2 struck the north side of [[Childress, Texas]], resulting in considerable damage. Many trees along the path were snapped and uprooted, roofs of homes were damaged, and sheds were overturned in residential areas. As the tornado struck Childress High School, the gymnasium lost its roof and sustained total collapse of a large brick wall. Three air conditioning units were blown off the roof of the school, and two of them were blown from southeast to northwest, landing 90 to 200 feet from the school. A nearby nursing home was also damaged. At Fair Park, a tennis court was destroyed, several metal light poles were bent and snapped, and a pedestrian bridge that spanned a small lake was ripped from its wooden supports and thrown. An industrial storage building that housed emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with steel beams twisted.

It was primarily a straight-line wind event, although there were at least five tornadoes reported, some of which produced significant damage.\n\nA greater risk of tornadic activity was issued by the SPC on May 25 for a large swath from the [[Great Lakes]] to the central [[Mississippi Valley]]. The event turned into a derecho with hundreds of severe wind damage reports, but only six tornado reports. There were no tornado-related injuries, but at least one person was injured by straight-line winds.\n\n====May 30\u201331====\n\nA hot and humid air mass entered the northeastern part of the U.S as well as much of southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and severe thunderstorms and tornadoes were sparked by a cold front. Numerous severe weather events were reported across [[Michigan]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] - primarily damaging wind and hail events - when a storm system crossed the area during these two days.\n\nOn May 31 there were at least 6 reports of tornadoes in Indiana and Illinois with no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. Also, [[Lanark County, Ontario|Lanark County]] in eastern [[Ontario]] had two tornado warnings in a span of 18 hours, with the threat of a strong tornado on the evening of May 30. While damage was reported near [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] southwest of [[Perth, Ontario|Perth]] due to straight-line damaging winds, there were no immediate reports of tornadoes despite rotation inside two distinct supercells detected by radar.\n\n===June===\nThere were 139 confirmed tornadoes in the US in June.\n\n====June 5\u20137====\n\nA low pressure system over the northern Plains and a cold front triggered a small tornado outbreak. 17 tornadoes were reported in the [[Dakotas]], eastern [[Iowa]] and southwestern [[Wisconsin]] during these two days (of which at least seven were confirmed), 14 of them occurring on June 6. Two tornadoes were located near [[Barneveld, Wisconsin]], which was the site of an F5 tornado almost the same day in 1984. Both tornadoes were an F0.<ref>[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=060606_tor June 6, 2006 Tornadoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with damage especially confined to trees, although one home was damaged.

There was another tornado in [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk]] and [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia]] counties in Wisconsin, an [[Fujita scale|F1]].\n\nA separate system had reportedly spawned a tornado which inflicted damage to numerous houses near [[Seymour, Indiana]] north of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], but it was confirmed to have been a [[microburst]].\n\n====June 10====\nMore widespread severe weather occurred in the Central Plains with over 100 reports, mostly wind and hail events including reports of [[hurricane force]] wind-gusts. Tornadoes were confined especially in Nebraska where a mobile home and a barn were damaged and trailer was overturned near [[Gordon, Nebraska]]. There was also significant damage to trees and powerlines in [[New Florence, Missouri]] west of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\n====June 11\u201314: Tropical Storm Alberto====\n{{main|Tropical Storm Alberto (2006)}}\nTropical Storm Alberto made landfall on June 13, but was producing squalls well before then.

Despite the severity of the storms, only four tornadoes were reported in Kansas and three were confirmed; one was an F0 and the other two were F1, all in [[Sherman County, Kansas|Sherman County]].<ref>[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGLD All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====June 18\u201319====\n\nA warm and humid air mass was covering much of the eastern U.S. as well as [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] during this period of severe weather. With the passage of a [[cold front]] and instability, it created a wide area of severe thunderstorms, some as [[supercell]]s and others as [[squall line]]s, which created numerous damage in several U.S. cities as well as important Canadian cities such as [[Ottawa]], [[Sherbrooke]] and [[Granby, Quebec]].\n\nFirst, an unexpected tornado touched down in [[Hartford, Wisconsin]] in the middle of a rain storm with few other storm reports on June 18. Over 50 buildings were reported to have been damaged. Three people were injured by what turned out to be an F1 tornado.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/view/validProds.php?prod=PNS&node=KGRB All Products by Site - NOAA's National Weather Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Meanwhile, in [[Pembroke, Ontario]] further to the east, what was possibly a tornado but confirmed as a [[microburst]], several roofs including one from a marina and another one from a large warehouse were blown away during the passage of a [[supercell]] storm.\n\nOn June 19, a widespread severe weather event took place throughout the [[Great Lakes]] region and into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. There were no confirmed tornadoes in the US that day, but two were confirmed in [[Ontario]], Canada. One tornado touched down just north of [[Stratford, Ontario]]; it was an F1 and caused moderate damage.

Another tornado was reported southwest of [[Detroit]] inside a massive cluster of severe thunderstorms that passed through the area in the early evening. However, the tornado did little damage; most of the damage in southeast Michigan was due to straight-line winds.\n\nAnother area of severe weather spawned numerous possible tornadoes in [[Kansas]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Colorado]], with severe weather reports also occurring in [[Iowa]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Missouri]] and [[Nebraska]].\n\nThree people were injured as a result of a landfalling [[waterspout]] in [[Charlotte County, Florida]] in a separate and isolated event. It also damaged numerous homes and destroyed several mobile homes.

She married him on 12 July 1543, and outlived him by a year.  With four husbands she is the most-married English queen.\n\nCatherine enjoyed a close relationship with Henry's three children and was personally involved in the education of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. She was influential in Henry's passing of the [[Third Succession Act]] in 1543 that restored both his daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and Elizabeth, to the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] to the throne.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nCatherine was appointed [[regent]] from July to September 1544 while Henry was on a military campaign in France and in case he lost his life, she was to rule as regent until Edward came of age. However he did not give her any function in government in [[Will of Henry VIII of England|his will]]. In 1543, she published her first book, ''[[Psalms or Prayers]]'', anonymously.{{sfn|Parr|2011}} On account of Catherine's [[Protestant]] sympathies, she provoked the enmity of anti-Protestant officials, who sought to turn the King against her; a warrant for her arrest was drawn up in 1545. However, she and the King soon reconciled. Her book ''[[Prayers or Meditations]]'' became the first book published by an English queen under her own name. She assumed the role of Elizabeth's guardian following the King's death, and published a second book, ''[[The Lamentation of a Sinner]]''.\n\nHenry died on 28 January 1547. After the king's death, Catherine was allowed to keep the queen's jewels and dresses as [[queen dowager]]. About six months after Henry's death, she married her fourth and final husband, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley]]. The marriage was short-lived, as she died on Wednesday, 5 September 1548 due to complications of childbirth.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=294}}<ref name=\"telegraph\">Campbell, Sophie.

Sir Thomas Parr was a descendant of [[King Edward III]], and the Parrs were a substantial northern family which included many knights. Catherine's paternal grandparents were [[William Parr (died 1483)|Sir William Parr]] and [[Elizabeth FitzHugh]], a daughter of Henry, Baron FitzHugh of Ravensworth Castle and [[Alice Neville|Lady Alice Neville]], sister of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]] (\"Warwick, the Kingmaker\"). Catherine had a younger brother, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William]], later created first [[Marquess of Northampton]], and younger sister, [[Anne Parr, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]], later [[Earl of Pembroke|Countess of Pembroke]]. Sir Thomas was a close companion to [[King Henry VIII]], and was rewarded as such with responsibilities and/or incomes from his positions as [[Sheriff of Northamptonshire]], Master of the Wards, and Comptroller to the King, in addition to being the lord of Kendal. Catherine's mother was a close friend and attendant of [[Katherine of Aragon]], and Catherine Parr was probably named after Queen Katherine, who was her godmother.{{sfn|Porter|2011|p=25}}\n\nIt was once thought that Catherine Parr had been born at [[Kendal Castle]] in [[Westmorland]]. However, at the time of her birth, Kendal Castle was already in very poor condition.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson & Burn|1777|pp=45\u201346}}, and the archaeological findings during the excavation of Kendal Castle by Barbara Harbottle as published in {{harvnb|Quarto|loc=V(4).

August 1972}}</ref> During her pregnancy, Maud Parr remained at court, attending the Queen, and by necessity the Parr family was living in their townhouse at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]]. Historians now consider it unlikely that Sir Thomas would have taken his pregnant wife on an arduous two-week journey north over bad roads to give birth in a crumbling castle in which neither of them seemed to spend much time.{{sfn|Farrer & Curwen|1923|p=54}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=60\u201363}} Catherine's father died when she was young, and she was close to her mother as she grew up.{{sfn|Robin, Larsen & Levin|2007|p=289}}\n\nCatherine's initial education was similar to other well-born women, but she developed a passion for learning which would continue throughout her life. She was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], and [[Italian language|Italian]], and began learning [[Spanish language|Spanish]] after becoming queen.{{sfn|Starkey|2004|p=690}} According to biographer [[Linda Porter (historian)|Linda Porter]], the story that as a child, Catherine could not tolerate sewing and often said to her mother \"my hands are ordained to touch crowns and sceptres, not spindles and needles\" is almost certainly [[apocryphal]].{{sfn|Porter|2011|p=37}}\n\n== Lady Burgh ==\n\nIn 1529, when she was seventeen, Catherine married [[Sir Edward Burgh]] (pronounced and sometimes written as ''Borough''), a grandson of [[Edward Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh]]. Earlier biographies mistakenly reported that Catherine had married the older Burgh.{{sfn|Porter|2011}}{{sfn|Mosley 1|2003|p=587}} Following the 2nd Baron Burgh's death in December 1528, Catherine's father-in-law [[Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh|Sir Thomas Burgh]] was summoned to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1529 as [[Baron Burgh]].{{sfn|Porter|2011}}\n\nCatherine's first husband was in his twenties and may have been in poor health. He served as a [[feoffee]] for Thomas Kiddell and as a [[justice of the peace]]. His father also secured a joint patent in survivorship with his son for the office of steward of the manor of the [[Soke (legal)|soke]] of [[Kirton in Lindsey]]. The younger Sir Edward Burgh died in the spring of 1533, not surviving to inherit the title of Baron Burgh.{{sfn|Porter|2011}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n==Lady Latimer==\nFollowing her first husband's demise, Catherine Parr may have spent time with the Dowager Lady Strickland, Katherine Neville, who was the widow of Catherine's cousin Sir Walter Strickland, at the Stricklands' family residence of [[Sizergh Castle and Garden|Sizergh Castle]] in [[Westmorland]] (now in [[Cumbria]]). In the summer of 1534, Catherine married secondly [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Latimer]], her father's second cousin and a kinsman of Lady Strickland. With this marriage, Catherine became only the second woman in the Parr family to marry into the peerage.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nThe twice-widowed Latimer was twice Catherine's age. From his first marriage to Dorothy de Vere, sister of [[John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford]], he had two children, John and Margaret. Although Latimer was in financial difficulties after he and his brothers had pursued legal action to claim the title of [[Earl of Warwick]], Catherine now had a home of her own, a title and a husband with a position and influence in the north.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\n[[File:Snape Castle - geograph.org.uk - 467688.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Snape, North Yorkshire|Snape]] Castle]]\nLatimer was a supporter of the [[Catholic Church]] and had opposed the king's first [[annulment]], his subsequent marriage to [[Anne Boleyn]], and the religious consequences. In October 1536, during the [[Lincolnshire Rising]], Catholic rebels appeared before the Latimers' home threatening violence if Latimer did not join their efforts to reinstate the links between England and Rome. Catherine watched as her husband was dragged away. Between October 1536 and April 1537, Catherine lived alone in fear with her step-children, struggling to survive. It is probable that, in these uncertain times, Catherine's strong reaction against the rebellion strengthened her adherence to the [[English Reformation|reformed]] [[Church of England]].{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}} In January 1537, during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|uprising of the North]], Catherine and her step-children were held hostage at [[Snape, North Yorkshire|Snape]] Castle in Yorkshire. The rebels ransacked the house and sent word to Lord Latimer, who was returning from London, that if he did not return immediately they would kill his family. When Latimer returned to the castle, he somehow talked the rebels into releasing his family and leaving, but the aftermath would prove to be taxing on the whole family.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nThe King and [[Thomas Cromwell]] heard conflicting reports as to whether Latimer was a prisoner or a conspirator. As a conspirator, he could be found guilty of treason, forfeiting his estates and leaving Catherine and her step-children penniless. The King himself wrote to the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], pressing him to make sure Latimer would \"condemn that villain [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Aske]] and submit to our clemency\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=11, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=75488 1174]}} Latimer complied.  It is likely that Catherine's brother [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William Parr]] and his uncle, [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton]], who both fought against the rebellion, intervened to save Latimer's life.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nAlthough no charges were laid against him, Latimer's reputation, which reflected upon Catherine, was tarnished for the rest of his life. Over the next seven years, the family spent much of their time in the south. For several years, Latimer was blackmailed by Cromwell and forced to do his bidding. After Cromwell's death in 1540, the Latimers reclaimed some dignity. In 1542 the family spent time in London as Latimer attended Parliament. Catherine visited her brother [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William]] and her sister [[Anne Parr, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]] at court. It was here that Catherine became acquainted with her future fourth husband, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]]. The atmosphere of the court was greatly different from that of the rural estates she knew. There, Catherine could find the latest trends, not only in religious matters, but in less weighty secular matters such as fashion and jewellery.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nBy the winter of 1542, Lord Latimer's health had worsened. Catherine nursed her husband until his death in 1543. In his will, Catherine was named as guardian of his daughter, Margaret, and was put in charge of his affairs until his daughter's majority. Latimer left Catherine the manor of [[Stowe House|Stowe]] and other properties. He also bequeathed money for supporting his daughter, and in the case that his daughter did not marry within five years, Catherine was to take \u00a330 a year out of the income to support her step-daughter. Catherine was left a rich widow, but after Lord Latimer's death she faced the possibility of having to return north. It is likely that Catherine sincerely mourned her husband; she kept a remembrance of him, his New Testament with his name inscribed inside, until her death.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nUsing her late mother's friendship with Henry's first queen, [[Catherine of Aragon]], Catherine took the opportunity to renew her own friendship with the former queen's daughter, [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary]]. By 16 February 1543, Catherine had established herself as part of Mary's household, and it was there that Catherine caught the attention of the King. Although she had begun a romantic friendship with [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]], the brother of the late queen [[Jane Seymour]], she saw it as her duty to accept Henry's proposal over Seymour's. Seymour was given a posting in [[Brussels]] to remove him from the king's court.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Queen of England and Ireland==\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n[[File:Queen Catherine Parr.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Melton Constable Hall|Melton Constable]]'' or ''Hastings'' portrait of Queen Catherine{{sfn|Edwards|2010}}]]\nCatherine married Henry VIII on 12 July 1543 at [[Hampton Court Palace]]. She was the first Queen of England also to be [[Queen of Ireland]] following Henry's adoption of the title [[King of Ireland]]. Catherine and her new husband shared several common royal and noble ancestors making them multiple cousins. By Henry's mother and Catherine's father they were third cousins once removed sharing [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]], and [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Lady Joan Beaufort]] (granddaughter of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]) and by their fathers they were double fourth cousins once removed, sharing [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]] (son of [[Joan of Kent]]) and [[Alice Holland, Countess of Kent|Lady Alice FitzAlan]] (granddaughter of [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]]) and [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]] (son of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]) and [[Katherine Swynford]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn becoming queen, Catherine installed her former stepdaughter, Margaret Neville, as her lady-in-waiting, and gave her stepson John's wife, [[Lucy Somerset]], a position in her household.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}} Catherine was partially responsible for reconciling Henry with his daughters from his first two marriages, and also developed a good relationship with Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. When she became queen, her uncle [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton|Lord Parr of Horton]] became her [[Lord Chamberlain]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nHenry went on his last, unsuccessful, campaign to France from July to September 1544, leaving Catherine as his [[regent]]. Because her regency council was composed of sympathetic members, including her uncle [[Thomas Cranmer]] (the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) and [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Hertford]], Catherine obtained effective control and was able to rule as she saw fit. She handled provision, finances, and musters for Henry's French campaign, signed five royal proclamations, and maintained constant contact with her lieutenant in the northern Marches, [[Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Shrewsbury]], over the complex and unstable situation with Scotland. It is thought that her actions as regent, together with her strength of character and noted dignity, and later religious convictions, greatly influenced her stepdaughter Lady Elizabeth (the future [[Elizabeth I of England]]).{{sfn|Porter|2011|p=348}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Catherine Parr.svg|thumb|upright|250px|Catherine Parr's arms as queen consort{{sfn|Boutell|1863|pp=243\u2013244}}]]\n[[File:Rose Maiden Badge.svg|thumb|right|125px|Rose Maiden badge used by the Queen-consort]]\nThe Queen's religious views were viewed with suspicion by anti-Protestant officials such as [[Stephen Gardiner]] (the [[Bishop of Winchester]]) and [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Lord Wriothesley]] (the [[Lord Chancellor]]).{{sfn|Hart|2009}} Although brought up as a Catholic, she later became sympathetic to and interested in the \"New Faith\". By the mid-1540s, she came under suspicion that she was actually a [[Protestant]]. This view is supported by the strong reformed ideas that she revealed after Henry's death, when her second book, ''{{Proper name|Lamentacion of a synner}}'' (Lamentation of a Sinner), was published in late 1547. The book promoted the Protestant concept of [[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]], which the Catholic Church deemed to be heresy. It is unlikely that she developed these views in the short time between Henry's death and the publication of the book. Her sympathy with [[Anne Askew]], the Protestant martyr who fiercely opposed the Catholic belief of [[transubstantiation]], also suggests that she was more than merely sympathetic to the new religion.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:1550 Parr Prayers or Meditations.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title page of Parr's ''[[Prayers or Meditations]]'', published in 1545]]\nIn 1546, the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Wriothesley tried to turn the king against her. An arrest warrant was drawn up for her and rumours abounded across Europe that the King was attracted to her close friend, the [[Catherine Willoughby, 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby|Duchess of Suffolk]].{{sfn|Hart|2009}} However, she saw the warrant and managed to reconcile with the King after vowing that she had only argued about religion with him to take his mind off the suffering caused by his ulcerous leg.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.exclassics.com/foxe/foxe212.htm |title=Katherine Parr |last=Foxe |first=John |authorlink=John Foxe |website=The Acts and Monuments of John Fox |publisher=Exclassics.com |access-date=29 January 2014}}</ref> The following day an armed guard who was unaware of the reconciliation tried to arrest her while she walked with the King.{{sfn|Starkey|2002|p=129}}\n\n==Final marriage and death==\nShortly before he died, Henry made provision for an allowance of \u00a37,000 per year for Catherine to support herself. He further ordered that, after his death, Catherine, though a [[queen dowager]], should be given the respect of a queen of England, as if he were still alive. Catherine retired from court after the coronation of her stepson, [[Edward VI]], on 31 January 1547, to her home at [[Chelsea Manor|Old Manor]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nFollowing Henry's death, Catherine's old love and the new king's uncle, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] (who was soon created 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley), returned to court. Catherine was quick to accept when Seymour renewed his suit of marriage. Since only four months had passed since the death of King Henry, Seymour knew that the Regency council would not agree to a petition for the queen dowager to marry so soon. Sometime near the end of May, Catherine and Seymour married in secret.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} King Edward VI and council were not informed of the union for several months. When their union became public knowledge, it caused a small scandal. The King and Lady Mary were very much displeased by the union. After being censured and reprimanded by the council, Seymour wrote to the Lady Mary asking her to intervene on his behalf. Mary became furious at his forwardness and tasteless actions and refused to help. Mary even went as far as asking her half-sister, Lady Elizabeth, not to interact with Queen Catherine any further.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=268\u2013276}}\n\nDuring this time, Catherine began having altercations with her brother-in-law, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]]. Like Thomas, Edward was the King's uncle, and also was the Lord Protector. A rivalry developed between Catherine and his wife, her own former lady-in-waiting, [[Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset]], which became particularly acute over the matter of Catherine's jewels.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2009|p=271}}; citing British Library, Add. Ms. 46,348, f.67b: {{harvnb|Starkey|1998|pp=77\u201380}}; 122 items of jewellery.</ref> The Duchess argued that as queen dowager, Catherine, was no longer entitled to wear the jewels belonging to the wife of the king. Instead she, as the wife of the protector, should be the one to wear them. Eventually, the Duchess won the argument, which left her relationship with Catherine permanently damaged; the relationship between the two Seymour brothers also worsened as a result, since Thomas<!--not \"Lord Thomas\" anything--> saw the whole dispute as a personal attack by his brother on his social standing.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=268\u2013276}}\n\nIn November 1547, Catherine published her second book, ''[[The Lamentation of a Sinner]]''. The book was a success and widely praised.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn March 1548, at the age of 35, Catherine became pregnant. This pregnancy was a surprise, as Catherine had not conceived during her first three marriages. During this time, Seymour began to take an interest in Lady Elizabeth. Seymour had reputedly plotted to marry her before marrying Catherine, and it was reported later that Catherine discovered the two in an embrace. On a few occasions before the situation risked getting completely out of hand, according to the [[deposition (law)|deposition]] of [[Kat Ashley]], Catherine appears not only to have acquiesced in episodes of [[horseplay humor|horseplay]], but actually to have assisted her husband.<ref>Deposition of [[Kat Ashley|Katherine Ashley]] in {{harvnb|Haynes|1740|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99#v=onepage&q&f=false 99\u2013101]}}; Christopher Hibbert (1990) ''The Virgin Queen''; Antonia Fraser (1992) ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII''; Alison Weir (1996) ''Children of England''; David Starkey (2000) ''Elizabeth''; {{harvnb|Porter|2011}} Most biographers of Catherine, Thomas Seymour, or Elizabeth refer to Catherine and Seymour tickling Elizabeth in her bed and Catherine holding down Elizabeth while her husband cut her dress into shreds. Although extant evidence does not support the notion of a fully-fledged ''[[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]]'', or even that Seymour's flirtation with Elizabeth led to sexual intercourse with her, Starkey has speculated as to how such behaviour would play in front of a modern panel of social workers and pediatricians (''Elizabeth, op.cit.'') Nor is it clear from contemporaneous evidence that Catherine's \"pert and pretty stepdaughter\", to use Starkey's description, was a wholly unwilling participant in such antics.</ref> Whatever actually happened, Elizabeth was sent away in May 1548 to stay with Sir Anthony Denny's household at [[Cheshunt]] and never saw her beloved stepmother again, although the two corresponded. Elizabeth immediately wrote a letter to the Queen and Seymour after she left Chelsea. The letter demonstrates a sort of remorse.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nKat Ashley, whose deposition was given after Catherine had died and Seymour had been arrested for another attempt at marrying Lady Elizabeth, had developed a crush on Seymour during her time at Chelsea and actually encouraged her charge to \"play along.\" At one point she even made a comment at how lucky Elizabeth would have been to have a husband like Seymour.{{sfn|Starkey|2000}} Ashley even told Lady Elizabeth that Seymour had confided his sentiments to her of wanting to marry Elizabeth before Catherine.{{sfn|Haynes|1740|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102\u2013103]}} After Catherine's death, Ashley strongly encouraged Elizabeth to write to Seymour offering her condolences; to \"comfort him of his sorrow...for he would think great kindness therein.\"{{sfn|Haynes|1740|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102\u2013103]}}\n\nIn June 1548, Catherine, accompanied by [[Lady Jane Grey]], moved to [[Sudeley Castle]] in Gloucestershire. The dowager queen promised to provide education for her. It was there that Catherine would spend the last few months of her pregnancy and the last summer of her life.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=291}}\n\nCatherine gave birth to her only child, a daughter, [[Mary Seymour]], named after Catherine's stepdaughter Mary, on 30 August 1548.

Catherine's other jewels were kept in a coffer with five drawers at Sudeley and this was sent to the [[Tower of London]] on 20 April 1549, and her clothes and papers followed in May.<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|1998}}, pp. 94\u201396; jewel inventory of 116 items; pp.&nbsp;434\u2013437, wardrobe 133 items.</ref> After a year and a half, on 17 March 1550, Mary's property was restored to her by an [[Act of Parliament]], easing the burden of the infant's household on the duchess. The last mention of Mary Seymour on record is on her second birthday, and although stories circulated that she eventually married and had children, most historians believe she died as a child at [[Grimsthorpe Castle]] in Lincolnshire.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n==Remains==\nIn 1782, John Locust discovered the coffin of Queen Catherine in the ruins of the [[Sudeley Castle]] chapel. The coffin was identified by a lead plate with an inscription on the coffin.<ref name=\"mueller\" /> He opened the coffin and observed that the body, after 234 years, was in a surprisingly good condition. Reportedly the flesh on one of her arms was still white and moist. After taking a few locks of her hair, he closed the coffin and returned it to the grave.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe coffin was opened a few more times in the next ten years and in 1792 some drunken men buried it upside down and in a rough way.  When the coffin was officially reopened in 1817, nothing but a skeleton remained. Her remains were then moved to the tomb of [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Lord Chandos]] whose family owned the castle at that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk/history/timeline |title=Sudeley History Timeline |website=Sudeley Castle |publisher=Sudeleycastle.co.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020073419/https://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk/history/timeline/1655-1837 |archive-date=20 October 2013 |access-date=31 January 2014 |df=dmy}}</ref> The tomb was carefully restored by order of the late Duchess of Buckingham, Lady Anne Greville, daughter of the [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos|3rd Duke of Chandos]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/places/other/sudeley.htm |title=Sudeley Castle |website=Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos |publisher=Dukesofbuckingham.org.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003071959/http://www.dukesofbuckingham.org.uk/places/other/sudeley.htm |archive-date=3 October 2011 |access-date=31 January 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In later years the chapel was rebuilt by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]], who erected a canopied tomb with a recumbent marble figure by [[John Birnie Philip]].{{sfn|A Handbook for Travellers|1872|p=162}}\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Image:Catherine Parr.jpg|thumb|200px|This portrait originally and now identified as Catherine Parr was wrongly identified as Lady Jane Grey for decades.]]\n[[Image:Catherine Parr, attributed to Master John.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of Catherine's headdress and jewels]]\nThe full-length portrait of Catherine Parr by Master John in the [[National Gallery|National Portrait Gallery]] was for many years thought to represent [[Lady Jane Grey]]. The painting has recently been re-identified as Catherine Parr, with whose name it was originally associated. The full-length format was very rare in portraits of this date, and was usually used only for very important sitters. Lady Jane Grey, although of royal blood, was a relatively obscure child of eight when this was painted (circa 1545); it was to be another eight years before the short-lived attempt at placing her on the throne. The distinctive crown-shaped jewel the sitter wears can be traced to an inventory of jewels that belonged to Catherine Parr, and the cameo beads appear to have belonged to [[Catherine Howard]], from whom they would have passed to her successor as queen.{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Gittings|2006|p=14}}{{sfn|James|1996|pp=20\u201324}}\n\n==In media==\n\nCatherine Parr first appeared as a character in cinemas in 1934, in [[Alexander Korda]]'s film ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]''. [[Charles Laughton]] played the king, with actress Everley Gregg appearing as Catherine. The film makes no attempt to depict the historical Parr's character, instead portraying the Queen for comic effect as a domineering and over-protective nag.  \n\nIn 1952, a romanticised version of [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]]'s obsession with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] saw [[Stewart Granger]] as Seymour, [[Jean Simmons]] as the young Elizabeth and screen legend [[Deborah Kerr]] as Parr in the popular film ''[[Young Bess]]''.\nIn 1970, in \"Catherine Parr\", a 90-minute BBC television drama (the last in a 6-part series, entitled ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'') Catherine was played by [[Rosalie Crutchley]] opposite [[Keith Michell]]'s Henry. In this, Catherine's love of religion and intellectual capabilities were highlighted. Crutchley reprised her role as Catherine Parr for the first episode of the 6-part follow-up series on the life of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1971, ''[[Elizabeth R]]''. In 1972, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] played a matronly Catherine in ''[[Henry VIII and his Six Wives]]'', with Keith Michell once again playing Henry.\n\nIn 2000, Jennifer Wigmore played Catherine Parr in the American television drama aimed at teenagers, ''Elizabeth: Red Rose of the House of Tudor''. A year later, Caroline Lintott played Katherine in Professor [[David Starkey]]'s documentary series on Henry's queens. In October 2003, in a two-part British television series on ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]'', Catherine was played by [[Clare Holman]]. The part was relatively small, given that the drama's second part focused more on the stories of [[Jane Seymour]] and [[Catherine Howard]].\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Margical History Tour]],\" Catherine is portrayed by [[Agnes Skinner]] as an elderly widow during [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s retelling of Henry's reign. Henry (portrayed by [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]) regrets his marriage to her because of her age. In March 2007, [[Washington University in St. Louis]] performed the [[A.E. Hotchner]] Playwriting Competition winner ''Highness,'' which documents the life of Catherine Parr and her relationships with King Henry and his daughter, the future Queen [[Elizabeth I]], to whom she was a stepmother.{{sfn|Otten|2007}}\n\nCatherine Parr was portrayed by actress [[Joely Richardson]] on the fourth and final season of Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]'', which was first broadcast in spring 2010.{{sfn|Ausiello|2009}} Richardson's portrayal was largely faithful to what has been recorded of Parr's character. Catherine features in ''The Dark Rose'', Volume 2 of [[The Morland Dynasty]] a series of historical novels by author [[Cynthia Harrod-Eagles]]. The lead female character, Nanette Morland, is educated alongside Catherine and is later re-acquainted with her when she becomes Queen. She has been the subject of several novels, including two titled ''The Sixth Wife,'' and she is a supporting character in C. J. Sansom's ''Matthew Shardlake'' mysteries, ''[[Revelation (C. J. Sansom novel)|Revelation]]'', ''[[Heartstone (novel)|Heartstone]]'' and ''[[Lamentation (novel)|Lamentation]]''.\n\nIn 2015, the [[Stratford Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] [[Ontario]] debuted a new play called ''The Last Wife'' about Catherine Parr and her relationships with [[Henry VIII]], [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] and Henry's three children. The play was written by Kate Hennig. [http://maevbeaty.com Maev Beaty] played Katherine Parr. In the retelling of Henry VIII's sixth wife by [[Sara Pascoe]] in [[Drunk History (UK TV series)|Drunk History]] (UK version, series 2, episode 9) Catherine Parr is portrayed by [[Emma Bunton]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\nCatherine Parr is a character in the 2017 musical [[Six (musical)|''Six'']], by [[Toby Marlow]] and Lucy Moss. In the [[West End theatre|West End]] production, the role of Catherine Parr has been played by Izuka Hoyle, Maiya Quansah-Breed, and Danielle Steers. A United States run in Chicago in May 2019 saw Catherine played by Anna Uzele. ''Six'' was set to open on Broadway in April 2020, with Catherine to be played again by Anna Uzele.\n\n[[Rick Wakeman]] recorded the piece \"Catherine Parr\" for his 1973 album, ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''. On his [[The Six Wives of Henry VIII Live at Hampton Court Palace|2009 live version of the album]] the track's spelling is changed to \"Katherine Parr\".\n\n==Historiography==\nThe popular myth that Catherine Parr acted more as her husband's nurse than his wife was born in the 19th century from the work of Victorian moralist and proto-feminist, [[Agnes Strickland]]. [[David Starkey]] challenged this assumption in his book ''Six Wives,'' in which he points out that such a situation would have been vaguely obscene to the Tudors\u2014given that Henry had a huge staff of physicians waiting on him hand and foot, and Catherine was expected to live up to the heavy expectations of Queenly dignity. Parr is usually portrayed in cinema and television by actresses who are much older than the queen, who was in her early 30s when she was Henry's wife and was about 36 years old at the time of her death. This change is usually an artistic licence taken to highlight Parr's maturity in comparison to Henry's previous queens, or at least a symptom of the longer lifespans enjoyed by modern audiences (who might be confused as to why a 30-year-old is considered much older and more experienced).{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nCatherine's good sense, moral rectitude, compassion, firm religious commitment and strong sense of loyalty and devotion have earned her many admirers among historians. These include [[David Starkey]], feminist activist Karen Lindsey, Lady [[Antonia Fraser]], [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]], [[Carolly Erickson]], [[Alison Plowden]], Susan James and Linda Porter. Biographers have described her as strong-willed and outspoken, physically desirable, susceptible (like Queen Elizabeth) to roguish charm and even willing to resort to obscene language if the occasion suited.<ref>See generally {{harvnb|James|2012}}; {{harvnb|Porter|2011}}; Porter, ''History Today'' 60 (4): 17\u201322.

The inscription comes from a lead plate that is on her coffin.</ref>), was [[List of English consorts|queen consort of England]] and [[List of Irish queens and consorts|Ireland]] (1543\u201347) as the last of [[Wives of Henry VIII|the six wives]] of [[King Henry VIII]], and the final queen consort of the [[House of Tudor]]. She married him on 12 July 1543, and outlived him by nearly four years.  With four husbands she is the most-married English queen.\n\nCatherine enjoyed a close relationship with Henry's three children and was personally involved in the education of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. She was influential in Henry's passing of the [[Third Succession Act]] in 1543 that restored both his daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and Elizabeth, to the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] to the throne.{{sfn|Jones|2010}}\n\nCatherine was appointed [[regent]] from July to September 1544 while Henry was on a military campaign in France and in case he lost his life, she was to rule as regent until Edward came of age. However he did not give her any function in government in [[Will of Henry VIII of England|his will]]. In 1543, she published her first book, ''[[Psalms or Prayers]]'', anonymously.{{sfn|Parr|2011}} On account of Catherine's [[Protestant]] sympathies, she provoked the enmity of anti-Protestant officials, who sought to turn the King against her; a warrant for her arrest was drawn up in 1545. However, she and the King soon reconciled. Her book ''[[Prayers or Meditations]]'' became the first book published by an English queen under her own name. She assumed the role of Elizabeth's guardian following the King's death, and published a second book, ''[[The Lamentation of a Sinner]]''.\n\nHenry died on 28 January 1547. After the king's death, Catherine was allowed to keep the queen's jewels and dresses as [[queen dowager]]. About six months after Henry's death, she married her fourth and final husband, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley]]. The marriage was short-lived, as she died on Wednesday, 5 September 1548 due to complications of childbirth.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=294}}<ref name=\"telegraph\">Campbell, Sophie.

Sir Thomas Parr was a descendant of [[King Edward III]], and the Parrs were a substantial northern family which included many knights. Catherine's paternal grandparents were [[William Parr (died 1483)|Sir William Parr]] and [[Elizabeth FitzHugh]], a daughter of Henry, Baron FitzHugh of Ravensworth Castle and [[Alice Neville|Lady Alice Neville]], sister of [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]] (\"Warwick, the Kingmaker\"). Catherine had a younger brother, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William]], later created first [[Marquess of Northampton]], and younger sister, [[Anne Parr, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]], later [[Earl of Pembroke|Countess of Pembroke]]. Sir Thomas was a close companion to [[King Henry VIII]], and was rewarded as such with responsibilities and/or incomes from his positions as [[Sheriff of Northamptonshire]], Master of the Wards, and Comptroller to the King, in addition to being the lord of Kendal. Catherine's mother was a close friend and attendant of [[Katherine of Aragon]], and Catherine Parr was probably named after Queen Katherine, who was her godmother.{{sfn|Porter|2011|p=25}}\n\nIt was once thought that Catherine Parr had been born at [[Kendal Castle]] in [[Westmorland]]. However, at the time of her birth, Kendal Castle was already in very poor condition.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson & Burn|1777|pp=45\u201346}}, and the archaeological findings during the excavation of Kendal Castle by Barbara Harbottle as published in {{harvnb|Quarto|loc=V(4).

August 1972}}</ref> During her pregnancy, Maud Parr remained at court, attending the Queen, and by necessity the Parr family was living in their townhouse at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]]. Historians now consider it unlikely that Sir Thomas would have taken his pregnant wife on an arduous two-week journey north over bad roads to give birth in a crumbling castle in which neither of them seemed to spend much time.{{sfn|Farrer & Curwen|1923|p=54}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=60\u201363}} Catherine's father died when she was young, and she was close to her mother as she grew up.{{sfn|Robin, Larsen & Levin|2007|p=289}}\n\nCatherine's initial education was similar to other well-born women, but she developed a passion for learning which would continue throughout her life. She was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], and [[Italian language|Italian]], and began learning [[Spanish language|Spanish]] after becoming queen.{{sfn|Starkey|2004|p=690}} According to biographer [[Linda Porter (historian)|Linda Porter]], the story that as a child, Catherine could not tolerate sewing and often said to her mother \"my hands are ordained to touch crowns and sceptres, not spindles and needles\" is almost certainly [[apocryphal]].{{sfn|Porter|2011|p=37}}\n\n== Lady Burgh ==\n\nIn 1529, when she was seventeen, Catherine married [[Sir Edward Burgh]] (pronounced and sometimes written as ''Borough''), a grandson of [[Edward Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh]]. Earlier biographies mistakenly reported that Catherine had married the older Burgh.{{sfn|Porter|2011}}{{sfn|Mosley 1|2003|p=587}} Following the 2nd Baron Burgh's death in December 1528, Catherine's father-in-law [[Thomas Burgh, 1st Baron Burgh|Sir Thomas Burgh]] was summoned to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1529 as [[Baron Burgh]].{{sfn|Porter|2011}}\n\nCatherine's first husband was in his twenties and may have been in poor health. He served as a [[feoffee]] for Thomas Kiddell and as a [[justice of the peace]]. His father also secured a joint patent in survivorship with his son for the office of steward of the manor of the [[Soke (legal)|soke]] of [[Kirton in Lindsey]]. The younger Sir Edward Burgh died in the spring of 1533, not surviving to inherit the title of Baron Burgh.{{sfn|Porter|2011}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=60\u201363}}\n\n==Lady Latimer==\nFollowing her first husband's demise, Catherine Parr may have spent time with the Dowager Lady Strickland, Katherine Neville, who was the widow of Catherine's cousin Sir Walter Strickland, at the Stricklands' family residence of [[Sizergh Castle and Garden|Sizergh Castle]] in [[Westmorland]] (now in [[Cumbria]]). In the summer of 1534, Catherine married secondly [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Latimer]], her father's second cousin and a kinsman of Lady Strickland. With this marriage, Catherine became only the second woman in the Parr family to marry into the peerage.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nThe twice-widowed Latimer was twice Catherine's age. From his first marriage to Dorothy de Vere, sister of [[John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford]], he had two children, John and Margaret. Although Latimer was in financial difficulties after he and his brothers had pursued legal action to claim the title of [[Earl of Warwick]], Catherine now had a home of her own, a title and a husband with a position and influence in the north.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\n[[File:Snape Castle - geograph.org.uk - 467688.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Snape, North Yorkshire|Snape]] Castle]]\nLatimer was a supporter of the [[Catholic Church]] and had opposed the king's first [[annulment]], his subsequent marriage to [[Anne Boleyn]], and the religious consequences. In October 1536, during the [[Lincolnshire Rising]], Catholic rebels appeared before the Latimers' home threatening violence if Latimer did not join their efforts to reinstate the links between England and Rome. Catherine watched as her husband was dragged away. Between October 1536 and April 1537, Catherine lived alone in fear with her step-children, struggling to survive. It is probable that, in these uncertain times, Catherine's strong reaction against the rebellion strengthened her adherence to the [[English Reformation|reformed]] [[Church of England]].{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}} In January 1537, during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|uprising of the North]], Catherine and her step-children were held hostage at [[Snape, North Yorkshire|Snape]] Castle in Yorkshire. The rebels ransacked the house and sent word to Lord Latimer, who was returning from London, that if he did not return immediately they would kill his family. When Latimer returned to the castle, he somehow talked the rebels into releasing his family and leaving, but the aftermath would prove to be taxing on the whole family.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nThe King and [[Thomas Cromwell]] heard conflicting reports as to whether Latimer was a prisoner or a conspirator. As a conspirator, he could be found guilty of treason, forfeiting his estates and leaving Catherine and her step-children penniless. The King himself wrote to the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], pressing him to make sure Latimer would \"condemn that villain [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Aske]] and submit to our clemency\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=11, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=75488 1174]}} Latimer complied.  It is likely that Catherine's brother [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William Parr]] and his uncle, [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton]], who both fought against the rebellion, intervened to save Latimer's life.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nAlthough no charges were laid against him, Latimer's reputation, which reflected upon Catherine, was tarnished for the rest of his life. Over the next seven years, the family spent much of their time in the south. For several years, Latimer was blackmailed by Cromwell and forced to do his bidding. After Cromwell's death in 1540, the Latimers reclaimed some dignity. In 1542 the family spent time in London as Latimer attended Parliament. Catherine visited her brother [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton|William]] and her sister [[Anne Parr, Countess of Pembroke|Anne]] at court. It was here that Catherine became acquainted with her future fourth husband, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]]. The atmosphere of the court was greatly different from that of the rural estates she knew. There, Catherine could find the latest trends, not only in religious matters, but in less weighty secular matters such as fashion and jewellery.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nBy the winter of 1542, Lord Latimer's health had worsened. Catherine nursed her husband until his death in 1543. In his will, Catherine was named as guardian of his daughter, Margaret, and was put in charge of his affairs until his daughter's majority. Latimer left Catherine the manor of [[Stowe House|Stowe]] and other properties. He also bequeathed money for supporting his daughter, and in the case that his daughter did not marry within five years, Catherine was to take \u00a330 a year out of the income to support her step-daughter. Catherine was left a rich widow, but after Lord Latimer's death she faced the possibility of having to return north. It is likely that Catherine sincerely mourned her husband; she kept a remembrance of him, his New Testament with his name inscribed inside, until her death.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}}\n\nUsing her late mother's friendship with Henry's first queen, [[Catherine of Aragon]], Catherine took the opportunity to renew her own friendship with the former queen's daughter, [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary]]. By 16 February 1543, Catherine had established herself as part of Mary's household, and it was there that Catherine caught the attention of the King. Although she had begun a romantic friendship with [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Sir Thomas Seymour]], the brother of the late queen [[Jane Seymour]], she saw it as her duty to accept Henry's proposal over Seymour's. Seymour was given a posting in [[Brussels]] to remove him from the king's court.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Queen of England and Ireland==\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n[[File:Queen Catherine Parr.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Melton Constable Hall|Melton Constable]]'' or ''Hastings'' portrait of Queen Catherine{{sfn|Edwards|2010}}]]\nCatherine married Henry VIII on 12 July 1543 at [[Hampton Court Palace]]. She was the first Queen of England also to be [[Queen of Ireland]] following Henry's adoption of the title [[King of Ireland]]. Catherine and her new husband shared several common royal and noble ancestors making them multiple cousins. By Henry's mother and Catherine's father they were third cousins once removed sharing [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]], and [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Lady Joan Beaufort]] (granddaughter of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]) and by their fathers they were double fourth cousins once removed, sharing [[Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent]] (son of [[Joan of Kent]]) and [[Alice Holland, Countess of Kent|Lady Alice FitzAlan]] (granddaughter of [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]]) and [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]] (son of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]) and [[Katherine Swynford]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nOn becoming queen, Catherine installed her former stepdaughter, Margaret Neville, as her lady-in-waiting, and gave her stepson John's wife, [[Lucy Somerset]], a position in her household.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=61\u201373}} Catherine was partially responsible for reconciling Henry with his daughters from his first two marriages, and also developed a good relationship with Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. When she became queen, her uncle [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Horton|Lord Parr of Horton]] became her [[Lord Chamberlain]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nHenry went on his last, unsuccessful, campaign to France from July to September 1544, leaving Catherine as his [[regent]]. Because her regency council was composed of sympathetic members, including her uncle [[Thomas Cranmer]] (the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) and [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Hertford]], Catherine obtained effective control and was able to rule as she saw fit. She handled provision, finances, and musters for Henry's French campaign, signed five royal proclamations, and maintained constant contact with her lieutenant in the northern Marches, [[Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Shrewsbury]], over the complex and unstable situation with Scotland. It is thought that her actions as regent, together with her strength of character and noted dignity, and later religious convictions, greatly influenced her stepdaughter Lady Elizabeth (the future [[Elizabeth I of England]]).{{sfn|Porter|2011|p=348}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Catherine Parr.svg|thumb|upright|250px|Catherine Parr's arms as queen consort{{sfn|Boutell|1863|pp=243\u2013244}}]]\n[[File:Rose Maiden Badge.svg|thumb|right|125px|Rose Maiden badge used by the Queen-consort]]\nThe Queen's religious views were viewed with suspicion by anti-Protestant officials such as [[Stephen Gardiner]] (the [[Bishop of Winchester]]) and [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Lord Wriothesley]] (the [[Lord Chancellor]]).{{sfn|Hart|2009}} Although brought up as a Catholic, she later became sympathetic to and interested in the \"New Faith\". By the mid-1540s, she came under suspicion that she was actually a [[Protestant]]. This view is supported by the strong reformed ideas that she revealed after Henry's death, when her second book, ''{{Proper name|Lamentacion of a synner}}'' (Lamentation of a Sinner), was published in late 1547. The book promoted the Protestant concept of [[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]], which the Catholic Church deemed to be heresy. It is unlikely that she developed these views in the short time between Henry's death and the publication of the book. Her sympathy with [[Anne Askew]], the Protestant martyr who fiercely opposed the Catholic belief of [[transubstantiation]], also suggests that she was more than merely sympathetic to the new religion.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:1550 Parr Prayers or Meditations.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title page of Parr's ''[[Prayers or Meditations]]'', published in 1545]]\nIn 1546, the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Wriothesley tried to turn the king against her. An arrest warrant was drawn up for her and rumours abounded across Europe that the King was attracted to her close friend, the [[Catherine Willoughby, 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby|Duchess of Suffolk]].{{sfn|Hart|2009}} However, she saw the warrant and managed to reconcile with the King after vowing that she had only argued about religion with him to take his mind off the suffering caused by his ulcerous leg.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.exclassics.com/foxe/foxe212.htm |title=Katherine Parr |last=Foxe |first=John |authorlink=John Foxe |website=The Acts and Monuments of John Fox |publisher=Exclassics.com |access-date=29 January 2014}}</ref> The following day an armed guard who was unaware of the reconciliation tried to arrest her while she walked with the King.{{sfn|Starkey|2002|p=129}}\n\n==Final marriage and death==\nShortly before he died, Henry made provision for an allowance of \u00a37,000 per year for Catherine to support herself. He further ordered that, after his death, Catherine, though a [[queen dowager]], should be given the respect of a queen of England, as if he were still alive. Catherine retired from court after the coronation of her stepson, [[Edward VI]], on 31 January 1547, to her home at [[Chelsea Manor|Old Manor]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nFollowing Henry's death, Catherine's old love and the new king's uncle, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] (who was soon created 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley), returned to court. Catherine was quick to accept when Seymour renewed his suit of marriage. Since only four months had passed since the death of King Henry, Seymour knew that the Regency council would not agree to a petition for the queen dowager to marry so soon. Sometime near the end of May, Catherine and Seymour married in secret.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} King Edward VI and council were not informed of the union for several months. When their union became public knowledge, it caused a small scandal. The King and Lady Mary were very much displeased by the union. After being censured and reprimanded by the council, Seymour wrote to the Lady Mary asking her to intervene on his behalf. Mary became furious at his forwardness and tasteless actions and refused to help. Mary even went as far as asking her half-sister, Lady Elizabeth, not to interact with Queen Catherine any further.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=268\u2013276}}\n\nDuring this time, Catherine began having altercations with her brother-in-law, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]]. Like Thomas, Edward was the King's uncle, and also was the Lord Protector. A rivalry developed between Catherine and his wife, her own former lady-in-waiting, [[Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset]], which became particularly acute over the matter of Catherine's jewels.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2009|p=271}}; citing British Library, Add. Ms. 46,348, f.67b: {{harvnb|Starkey|1998|pp=77\u201380}}; 122 items of jewellery.</ref> The Duchess argued that as queen dowager, Catherine, was no longer entitled to wear the jewels belonging to the wife of the king. Instead she, as the wife of the protector, should be the one to wear them. Eventually, the Duchess won the argument, which left her relationship with Catherine permanently damaged; the relationship between the two Seymour brothers also worsened as a result, since Thomas<!--not \"Lord Thomas\" anything--> saw the whole dispute as a personal attack by his brother on his social standing.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=268\u2013276}}\n\nIn November 1547, Catherine published her second book, ''[[The Lamentation of a Sinner]]''. The book was a success and widely praised.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn March 1548, at the age of 35, Catherine became pregnant. This pregnancy was a surprise, as Catherine had not conceived during her first three marriages. During this time, Seymour began to take an interest in Lady Elizabeth. Seymour had reputedly plotted to marry her before marrying Catherine, and it was reported later that Catherine discovered the two in an embrace. On a few occasions before the situation risked getting completely out of hand, according to the [[deposition (law)|deposition]] of [[Kat Ashley]], Catherine appears not only to have acquiesced in episodes of [[horseplay humor|horseplay]], but actually to have assisted her husband.<ref>Deposition of [[Kat Ashley|Katherine Ashley]] in {{harvnb|Haynes|1740|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99#v=onepage&q&f=false 99\u2013101]}}; Christopher Hibbert (1990) ''The Virgin Queen''; Antonia Fraser (1992) ''The Six Wives of Henry VIII''; Alison Weir (1996) ''Children of England''; David Starkey (2000) ''Elizabeth''; {{harvnb|Porter|2011}} Most biographers of Catherine, Thomas Seymour, or Elizabeth refer to Catherine and Seymour tickling Elizabeth in her bed and Catherine holding down Elizabeth while her husband cut her dress into shreds. Although extant evidence does not support the notion of a fully-fledged ''[[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]]'', or even that Seymour's flirtation with Elizabeth led to sexual intercourse with her, Starkey has speculated as to how such behaviour would play in front of a modern panel of social workers and pediatricians (''Elizabeth, op.cit.'') Nor is it clear from contemporaneous evidence that Catherine's \"pert and pretty stepdaughter\", to use Starkey's description, was a wholly unwilling participant in such antics.</ref> Whatever actually happened, Elizabeth was sent away in May 1548 to stay with Sir Anthony Denny's household at [[Cheshunt]] and never saw her beloved stepmother again, although the two corresponded. Elizabeth immediately wrote a letter to the Queen and Seymour after she left Chelsea. The letter demonstrates a sort of remorse.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nKat Ashley, whose deposition was given after Catherine had died and Seymour had been arrested for another attempt at marrying Lady Elizabeth, had developed a crush on Seymour during her time at Chelsea and actually encouraged her charge to \"play along.\" At one point she even made a comment at how lucky Elizabeth would have been to have a husband like Seymour.{{sfn|Starkey|2000}} Ashley even told Lady Elizabeth that Seymour had confided his sentiments to her of wanting to marry Elizabeth before Catherine.{{sfn|Haynes|1740|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102\u2013103]}} After Catherine's death, Ashley strongly encouraged Elizabeth to write to Seymour offering her condolences; to \"comfort him of his sorrow...for he would think great kindness therein.\"{{sfn|Haynes|1740|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YitDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102\u2013103]}}\n\nIn June 1548, Catherine, accompanied by [[Lady Jane Grey]], moved to [[Sudeley Castle]] in Gloucestershire. The dowager queen promised to provide education for her. It was there that Catherine would spend the last few months of her pregnancy and the last summer of her life.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=291}}\n\nCatherine gave birth to her only child, a daughter, [[Mary Seymour]], named after Catherine's stepdaughter Mary, on 30 August 1548. Catherine died on 5 September 1548, at [[Sudeley Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]], from what is thought to have been [[puerperal fever|\"childbed fever\"]].{{sfn|James|2009|pp=294}}<ref name=\"telegraph\" /> This illness was common due to the lack of hygiene around childbirth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7242 |title=Medical Definition of Childbed Fever |website=MedicineNet |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nCatherine's funeral was held on 7 September 1548.<ref name=\"mueller\"></ref> It was the first Protestant funeral held in English.<ref name=\"telegraph\" /> Her chief mourner was [[Lady Jane Grey]].

The last mention of Mary Seymour on record is on her second birthday, and although stories circulated that she eventually married and had children, most historians believe she died as a child at [[Grimsthorpe Castle]] in Lincolnshire.{{sfn|James|2009|pp=299\u2013300}}\n\n==Remains==\nIn 1782, John Locust discovered the coffin of Queen Catherine in the ruins of the [[Sudeley Castle]] chapel. The coffin was identified by a lead plate with an inscription on the coffin.<ref name=\"mueller\" /> He opened the coffin and observed that the body, after 234 years, was in a surprisingly good condition. Reportedly the flesh on one of her arms was still white and moist. After taking a few locks of her hair, he closed the coffin and returned it to the grave.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe coffin was opened a few more times in the next ten years and in 1792 some drunken men buried it upside down and in a rough way.  When the coffin was officially reopened in 1817, nothing but a skeleton remained.

The painting has recently been re-identified as Catherine Parr, with whose name it was originally associated. The full-length format was very rare in portraits of this date, and was usually used only for very important sitters. Lady Jane Grey, although of royal blood, was a relatively obscure child of eight when this was painted (circa 1545); it was to be another eight years before the short-lived attempt at placing her on the throne. The distinctive crown-shaped jewel the sitter wears can be traced to an inventory of jewels that belonged to Catherine Parr, and the cameo beads appear to have belonged to [[Catherine Howard]], from whom they would have passed to her successor as queen.{{sfn|Williamson|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Gittings|2006|p=14}}{{sfn|James|1996|pp=20\u201324}}\n\n==In media==\n\nCatherine Parr first appeared as a character in cinemas in 1934, in [[Alexander Korda]]'s film ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]''. [[Charles Laughton]] played the king, with actress Everley Gregg appearing as Catherine. The film makes no attempt to depict the historical Parr's character, instead portraying the Queen for comic effect as a domineering and over-protective nag.  \n\nIn 1952, a romanticised version of [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]]'s obsession with [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] saw [[Stewart Granger]] as Seymour, [[Jean Simmons]] as the young Elizabeth and screen legend [[Deborah Kerr]] as Parr in the popular film ''[[Young Bess]]''.\nIn 1970, in \"Catherine Parr\", a 90-minute BBC television drama (the last in a 6-part series, entitled ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'') Catherine was played by [[Rosalie Crutchley]] opposite [[Keith Michell]]'s Henry. In this, Catherine's love of religion and intellectual capabilities were highlighted. Crutchley reprised her role as Catherine Parr for the first episode of the 6-part follow-up series on the life of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1971, ''[[Elizabeth R]]''. In 1972, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] played a matronly Catherine in ''[[Henry VIII and his Six Wives]]'', with Keith Michell once again playing Henry.\n\nIn 2000, Jennifer Wigmore played Catherine Parr in the American television drama aimed at teenagers, ''Elizabeth: Red Rose of the House of Tudor''. A year later, Caroline Lintott played Katherine in Professor [[David Starkey]]'s documentary series on Henry's queens. In October 2003, in a two-part British television series on ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]'', Catherine was played by [[Clare Holman]]. The part was relatively small, given that the drama's second part focused more on the stories of [[Jane Seymour]] and [[Catherine Howard]].\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Margical History Tour]],\" Catherine is portrayed by [[Agnes Skinner]] as an elderly widow during [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s retelling of Henry's reign. Henry (portrayed by [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]) regrets his marriage to her because of her age. In March 2007, [[Washington University in St. Louis]] performed the [[A.E. Hotchner]] Playwriting Competition winner ''Highness,'' which documents the life of Catherine Parr and her relationships with King Henry and his daughter, the future Queen [[Elizabeth I]], to whom she was a stepmother.{{sfn|Otten|2007}}\n\nCatherine Parr was portrayed by actress [[Joely Richardson]] on the fourth and final season of Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]'', which was first broadcast in spring 2010.{{sfn|Ausiello|2009}} Richardson's portrayal was largely faithful to what has been recorded of Parr's character. Catherine features in ''The Dark Rose'', Volume 2 of [[The Morland Dynasty]] a series of historical novels by author [[Cynthia Harrod-Eagles]]. The lead female character, Nanette Morland, is educated alongside Catherine and is later re-acquainted with her when she becomes Queen. She has been the subject of several novels, including two titled ''The Sixth Wife,'' and she is a supporting character in C. J. Sansom's ''Matthew Shardlake'' mysteries, ''[[Revelation (C. J. Sansom novel)|Revelation]]'', ''[[Heartstone (novel)|Heartstone]]'' and ''[[Lamentation (novel)|Lamentation]]''.\n\nIn 2015, the [[Stratford Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] [[Ontario]] debuted a new play called ''The Last Wife'' about Catherine Parr and her relationships with [[Henry VIII]], [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] and Henry's three children. The play was written by Kate Hennig. [http://maevbeaty.com Maev Beaty] played Katherine Parr. In the retelling of Henry VIII's sixth wife by [[Sara Pascoe]] in [[Drunk History (UK TV series)|Drunk History]] (UK version, series 2, episode 9) Catherine Parr is portrayed by [[Emma Bunton]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\nCatherine Parr is a character in the 2017 musical [[Six (musical)|''Six'']], by [[Toby Marlow]] and Lucy Moss. In the [[West End theatre|West End]] production, the role of Catherine Parr has been played by Izuka Hoyle, Maiya Quansah-Breed, and Danielle Steers. A United States run in Chicago in May 2019 saw Catherine played by Anna Uzele. ''Six'' was set to open on Broadway in April 2020, with Catherine to be played again by Anna Uzele.\n\n[[Rick Wakeman]] recorded the piece \"Catherine Parr\" for his 1973 album, ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''. On his [[The Six Wives of Henry VIII Live at Hampton Court Palace|2009 live version of the album]] the track's spelling is changed to \"Katherine Parr\".\n\n==Historiography==\nThe popular myth that Catherine Parr acted more as her husband's nurse than his wife was born in the 19th century from the work of Victorian moralist and proto-feminist, [[Agnes Strickland]]. [[David Starkey]] challenged this assumption in his book ''Six Wives,'' in which he points out that such a situation would have been vaguely obscene to the Tudors\u2014given that Henry had a huge staff of physicians waiting on him hand and foot, and Catherine was expected to live up to the heavy expectations of Queenly dignity. Parr is usually portrayed in cinema and television by actresses who are much older than the queen, who was in her early 30s when she was Henry's wife and was about 36 years old at the time of her death. This change is usually an artistic licence taken to highlight Parr's maturity in comparison to Henry's previous queens, or at least a symptom of the longer lifespans enjoyed by modern audiences (who might be confused as to why a 30-year-old is considered much older and more experienced).{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nCatherine's good sense, moral rectitude, compassion, firm religious commitment and strong sense of loyalty and devotion have earned her many admirers among historians. These include [[David Starkey]], feminist activist Karen Lindsey, Lady [[Antonia Fraser]], [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]], [[Carolly Erickson]], [[Alison Plowden]], Susan James and Linda Porter. Biographers have described her as strong-willed and outspoken, physically desirable, susceptible (like Queen Elizabeth) to roguish charm and even willing to resort to obscene language if the occasion suited.<ref>See generally {{harvnb|James|2012}}; {{harvnb|Porter|2011}}; Porter, ''History Today'' 60 (4): 17\u201322.

In the 1790s, the first buildings around what was to become the High Street of Southend were completed. In the 19th century, Southend's status of a [[seaside resort]] grew after a visit from Princess [[Caroline of Brunswick]], and Southend Pier was constructed. From the 1960s onwards, the town declined as a holiday destination, Southend redeveloped itself as the home of the [[Access (credit card)|Access credit card]], due to it having one of the UK's first [[Electronic switching system|electronic telephone exchanges]]. After the 1960s, much of the town centre was developed for commerce and retail, and many original structures were lost to redevelopment. An annual seafront airshow, started in 1986 when it featured a flypast by [[Concorde]], used to take place each May until 2012.\n\n==History==\nOriginally the \"south end\" of the village of [[Prittlewell]], Southend was home to a few poor fisherman huts and farms that lay at the southern extremity of [[Prittlewell Priory]] land. In the 1790s landowner Daniel Scratton sold off land either side of what was to become the High Street, and the Grand Hotel (now Royal Hotel) and Grove Terrace (now Royal Terrace) were completed by 1794, and stagecoaches from London made it accessible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://navalmilitaryclubsouthend.co.uk/southendhistory.php |title=A Brief History of Southend |publisher=Naval & Military Club, Southend-on-Sea |accessdate=14 June 2015 }}</ref> Due to the bad transportation links between Southend and London, there was not rapid development during the [[Georgian Era]] like [[Brighton]]. It was the coming of the railways in the 19th Century and the visit of Princess [[Caroline of Brunswick]] that Southend's status of a seaside resort grew. During the 19th century Southend's pier was first constructed and the Clifftown development built,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clifftowntheatre.co.uk/aboutus.html|title=History \u2013 About Us \u2013 Clifftown Studios & Theatre|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703084121/http://clifftowntheatre.co.uk/aboutus.html|archive-date=3 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> attracting many tourists in the summer months to its seven miles of beaches and bathing in the sea. Good rail connections and proximity to London mean that much of the economy has been based on tourism, and that Southend has been a dormitory town for city workers ever since.

Southend became the home of the [[Access (credit card)|Access credit card]], due to it having one of the UK's first electronic telephone exchanges (it is still home to RBS Card Services \u2013 one of the former members of Access), with offices based in the former [[EKCO]] factory, Maitland House ([[Keddies]]), Victoria Circus and Southchurch Road. Since then, much of the town centre has been developed for commerce and retail, and during the 1960s many original structures were lost to redevelopment \u2013 such as the Talza Arcade & Victoria Market (replaced by what is now known as The Victoria Shopping Centre) and Southend Technical College ( on the site of the ODEON Cinema, now a campus of South Essex College<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southessex.ac.uk|title=skills education careers - South Essex College|website=www.southessex.ac.uk}}</ref>). However, about 6.4 million tourists still visit Southend per year, generating estimated revenues of \u00a3200 million a year. [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|H.M. Revenue & Customs]] (HMRC), (formerly H.M. Customs and Excise), are major employers in the town, and the central offices for the collection of [[VAT]] are located at Alexander House on Victoria Avenue.\n\nAn annual seafront airshow, started in 1986 when it featured a flypast by [[Concorde]] whilst on a passenger charter flight, used to take place each May and became one of Europe's largest free airshows. The aircraft flew parallel to the seafront, offset over the sea. The [[RAF Falcons]] parachute display team and RAF [[Red Arrows]] aerobatics team were regular visitors to the show. The last show was held in 2012; an attempt to revive the show for September 2015, as the Southend Airshow and Military Festival, failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southendairshow.com/|title=southendairshow.com|accessdate=10 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Local government district===\nSouthend-on-Sea was formed as a [[municipal borough]] in 1892 with the functions of local government shared with [[Essex|Essex County Council]]. In 1913 the borough was enlarged by the former area of [[Leigh on Sea Urban District]]. In 1914 the enlarged Southend gained the status of [[county borough]], exempt from [[county council]] control and a single-tier of local government. The county borough was enlarged in 1933 by the former area of [[Shoeburyness Urban District]] and part of [[Rochford Rural District]].\n\nIn 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Southend became a district of Essex with borough status.

He was nearly destitute, and lived off some meager contributions by his mother and the benevolence of fellow Spaniards, including [[Paco Durrio]], [[Pablo Uranga]], and [[Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol i Prats|Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol]].<ref>Brinton 1916,  page 13</ref> \n\nAfter only six months' work he completed his first picture, which was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1890. Continuing his studies in Paris, where he lived for five years, he was in contact with post-impressionists such as [[Ramon Casas i Carb\u00f3|Ramon Casas]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], yet his tendencies were always to a thematic that was more ethnic in scope.\n\nHe attempted to gain success during a sojourn in London; but lackluster patronage led him to return to Spain, settling in [[Seville]], then [[Segovia]], and developed a style based on a realist Spanish tradition, recalling [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] and [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] in their earthy colouring and genre themes. He painted portraits of attired bullfighters and [[flamenco]] dancers; or portraits of family members and friends in such attire. He also painted village dwarves (''El enano Gregorio el Botero''; [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], St Petersburg, Russia) and beggars, often as stark figures in a dreary landscape with a traditional landscape or town in the background. He also painted some village-scape scenes.<ref>Brinton 1916, page 16</ref>  He favored earth or muted tones, including maroon, black, and grey, with the exception of colorful folk attire or the bright red cassock in some paintings.\n\nZuloaga and his patrons felt slighted in 1900, when his painting of ''Before the Bull-fight'' was rejected for inclusion into the Spanish representation at the Universal Exposition in [[Brussels]]. In 1899, one of his paintings exhibited in Paris had been purchased for the [[Luxembourg Palace]]. However, he did exhibit the painting at the Exposition of the Libre Esthetique in Brussels, and did see it acquired by the Modern Gallery in [[Brussels]]. He was accepted into the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1901 and 1903,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANhXAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quinta+Esposizione+Internazionale+Della+Citt%C3%A0+D'arte&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Ignacio&f=false|Quinta Esposizione Internazionale D'arte Della Citt\u00e0 Di Venezia 1903, Catalogo Illustrato], Third Edition; Premiato Stabilimento Dottore Chappuis, Bologna, 1903. page 39.</ref> and displayed 34 canvases at the Barcelona International exposition of 1907.<ref>Brinton 1916, pages 19\u201320</ref>\n\nAmong one of the more prominently displayed works is his ''Cristo de la Sangre'' (Christ of the Blood) or ''Hermandad del Cristo Crucificado'' (Brotherhood of the Crucified Christ), on display at the [[Museo Reina Sofia]] in Madrid. He also painted a similarly painting of individuals undergoing a traditional [[mortification of the flesh]] and a bleeding crucified Christ called ''The Flagellants'' (1900). These paintings were praised by [[Miguel de Unamuno|Unamuno]] in his book on ''De Arte Pictorico'' as being honest representation of Spain: a Spain ''religious and tragic, a black Spain''.<ref>\"Esta Espana religiosa y tragica esta Espana negra\" quoted in Nancy Dean Faires (2007), ''This is Not a Museum: the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao''.</ref> rooted in the particularly Spanish Catholic fascination with mutilating penance.\n\nBrinton in his review of an exposition in America in 1909, he states that: <blockquote>It is this racy and picturesque life which Zuloaga seeks above all else to place on record, and it is these popular types unspoiled by ruthless modernism which he pursues into the farthest corners of his native land. In this zealous quest of congenial models he hesitates at nothing. He will haunt for hours a fiesta on the outskirts of some provincial town, or hasten away to the mountains, passing months at a time with smugglers and muleteers, with the superstitious fanatics of Anso in the extreme north of Aragon or with the monkish cutthroats of [[Las Baluecas]], a little village on the southern boundary line of [[Salamanca]].<ref>Brinton 1916.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGil says that the faces of the old folk he paints are <blockquote>severe, roughly mystical, beset by painful thoughts, shadowed by the remembrance of the glory they once were, they have sad souls, moaning under the weight of an ideal of centuries, they are not individual representations, but the synthesis of the sadness of the Spanish Soul.<ref>Padre M. Gil, ''En el Estudio de Zuloaga'' in Five Essays, page 98....\"aquellos rostros de viejos y viejecitas, severos, rudamente m\u00edsticos, preocupados por un pensamiento doloroso, ensombrecidos por el recuerdo de glorias que fueron, tienen el alma triste, gimen bajo el peso de un ideal de siglos, no son representaciones individuales, son la s\u00edntesis de la tristeza del alma espa\u00f1ola.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the American collections to feature Zuloaga's work is the Johns Hopkins University's Evergreen Museum & Library, Baltimore, Maryland.  Officially owned by the Evergreen House Foundation, an independent entity started by Zuloaga's great friend, philanthropist Alice Warder Garrett (1877\u20131952), Evergreen's works include full-length portraits of Mrs. Garrett (1915; 1928); a seated portrait of Ambassador John Work Garrett (1872\u20131942); a Spanish landscape; a painting based on the opera ''Goyescas''; and a landscape of [[Calatayud]] (Spain).\n\nAn [[Iberia]] airline [[Airbus A340-642]] aircraft, registration EC-IZY, is named after him.\n\n==Zuloaga during and after the Spanish Civil War==\n\nZuloaga was committed to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[Spanish State]] of the ''[[caudillo]]'' [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], whose portrait he painted in 1940. During the war, Zuloaga honored the defenders of the ''[[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar]]'' in 1936, when the building's Nationalist defenders refused to surrender despite the building being in flames. This siege, and other events such as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Moscard\u00f3 Ituarte|General Moscardo's]] son, served as a rallying cry for the Nationalist forces.  In January 1939, this painting was hung in adjacent room displaying Picasso's modernist painting of [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]] during an exhibition of Spanish art in London.<ref>Crosson, D. page 148.</ref> The nationalist content of his depiction of the Alcazar was allied to Zuloaga's celebration of folk traditions. Stylistically, the directness of the ''Siege'' painting also avoids modernity's challenge to realistic depictions: [[Fascism]] was not endeared to complex symbolism such as found in works such as ''Guernica''.\n\nIn an April 1939 letter to his patron, Mrs Garret, Zuloaga stated:<blockquote>Thanks to God, and to Franco, at last the war is won and over! And over, despite the goodwill of those so-called democratic countries \u2013 what a farce, what shame, when those countries learn the truth of this drama! We all will work with all our strength to rebuild a new Spain (free, great and unified) to Spanishize Spain, and get rid of all outside influences, so that we can keep our great nature. That\u2019s my dream in art. I hate fads (which are destructive to racial characteristics) One must (for good or bad) be oneself, and not ape the style of anyone else. I will dedicate the years that are left to me to that end. What shame there will be in the future, for those countries who inflicted crime, savage vandalism, which reigned within the soviet clan in Spain!<ref>Crosson, page 151.</ref></blockquote>  He was later to claim that he was aghast, as a [[francophile]], when Hitler defeated France in 1940. After his death in 1945, he appeared on Spain's [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107040336/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/spain/SpainP148-500Pesetas-1954-donated_f.jpg 500 peseta] banknote emitted by [[Francoist Spain]] in its 1954 series, with a depiction of Toledo on the back.\n\nBrinton in his 1909 essay was prescient of Zuloaga's future enamourment with [[Falangism]]: <blockquote>He personifies in extreme form the spirit of autocracy in art, the principle of absolutism so typical of his race and country. You will meet in these bold, affirmative canvases no hint of cowardice or compromise. The work is defiant, almost despotic. It does not strive to enlist sympathy nor does it fear to be frankly antipathetic...the tones not infrequently acidulous, and the surfaces sometimes hard and metallic. Reactionary if you will...<ref>Brinton 1909, page 30.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Zuloaga, Ignacio}}\n*{{cite book|last=Brinton |first=Christian|title= ''Exhibition of Paintings by Ignacio Zuloaga under the auspices of Mrs Philip M Lydig.''

He was nearly destitute, and lived off some meager contributions by his mother and the benevolence of fellow Spaniards, including [[Paco Durrio]], [[Pablo Uranga]], and [[Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol i Prats|Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol]].<ref>Brinton 1916,  page 13</ref> \n\nAfter only six months' work he completed his first picture, which was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1890. Continuing his studies in Paris, where he lived for five years, he was in contact with post-impressionists such as [[Ramon Casas i Carb\u00f3|Ramon Casas]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], yet his tendencies were always to a thematic that was more ethnic in scope.\n\nHe attempted to gain success during a sojourn in London; but lackluster patronage led him to return to Spain, settling in [[Seville]], then [[Segovia]], and developed a style based on a realist Spanish tradition, recalling [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]] and [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] in their earthy colouring and genre themes. He painted portraits of attired bullfighters and [[flamenco]] dancers; or portraits of family members and friends in such attire. He also painted village dwarves (''El enano Gregorio el Botero''; [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], St Petersburg, Russia) and beggars, often as stark figures in a dreary landscape with a traditional landscape or town in the background. He also painted some village-scape scenes.<ref>Brinton 1916, page 16</ref>  He favored earth or muted tones, including maroon, black, and grey, with the exception of colorful folk attire or the bright red cassock in some paintings.\n\nZuloaga and his patrons felt slighted in 1900, when his painting of ''Before the Bull-fight'' was rejected for inclusion into the Spanish representation at the Universal Exposition in [[Brussels]]. In 1899, one of his paintings exhibited in Paris had been purchased for the [[Luxembourg Palace]]. However, he did exhibit the painting at the Exposition of the Libre Esthetique in Brussels, and did see it acquired by the Modern Gallery in [[Brussels]]. He was accepted into the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1901 and 1903,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANhXAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quinta+Esposizione+Internazionale+Della+Citt%C3%A0+D'arte&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Ignacio&f=false|Quinta Esposizione Internazionale D'arte Della Citt\u00e0 Di Venezia 1903, Catalogo Illustrato], Third Edition; Premiato Stabilimento Dottore Chappuis, Bologna, 1903. page 39.</ref> and displayed 34 canvases at the Barcelona International exposition of 1907.<ref>Brinton 1916, pages 19\u201320</ref>\n\nAmong one of the more prominently displayed works is his ''Cristo de la Sangre'' (Christ of the Blood) or ''Hermandad del Cristo Crucificado'' (Brotherhood of the Crucified Christ), on display at the [[Museo Reina Sofia]] in Madrid. He also painted a similarly painting of individuals undergoing a traditional [[mortification of the flesh]] and a bleeding crucified Christ called ''The Flagellants'' (1900). These paintings were praised by [[Miguel de Unamuno|Unamuno]] in his book on ''De Arte Pictorico'' as being honest representation of Spain: a Spain ''religious and tragic, a black Spain''.<ref>\"Esta Espana religiosa y tragica esta Espana negra\" quoted in Nancy Dean Faires (2007), ''This is Not a Museum: the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao''.</ref> rooted in the particularly Spanish Catholic fascination with mutilating penance.\n\nBrinton in his review of an exposition in America in 1909, he states that: <blockquote>It is this racy and picturesque life which Zuloaga seeks above all else to place on record, and it is these popular types unspoiled by ruthless modernism which he pursues into the farthest corners of his native land. In this zealous quest of congenial models he hesitates at nothing. He will haunt for hours a fiesta on the outskirts of some provincial town, or hasten away to the mountains, passing months at a time with smugglers and muleteers, with the superstitious fanatics of Anso in the extreme north of Aragon or with the monkish cutthroats of [[Las Baluecas]], a little village on the southern boundary line of [[Salamanca]].<ref>Brinton 1916.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGil says that the faces of the old folk he paints are <blockquote>severe, roughly mystical, beset by painful thoughts, shadowed by the remembrance of the glory they once were, they have sad souls, moaning under the weight of an ideal of centuries, they are not individual representations, but the synthesis of the sadness of the Spanish Soul.<ref>Padre M. Gil, ''En el Estudio de Zuloaga'' in Five Essays, page 98....\"aquellos rostros de viejos y viejecitas, severos, rudamente m\u00edsticos, preocupados por un pensamiento doloroso, ensombrecidos por el recuerdo de glorias que fueron, tienen el alma triste, gimen bajo el peso de un ideal de siglos, no son representaciones individuales, son la s\u00edntesis de la tristeza del alma espa\u00f1ola.\"</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the American collections to feature Zuloaga's work is the Johns Hopkins University's Evergreen Museum & Library, Baltimore, Maryland.  Officially owned by the Evergreen House Foundation, an independent entity started by Zuloaga's great friend, philanthropist Alice Warder Garrett (1877\u20131952), Evergreen's works include full-length portraits of Mrs. Garrett (1915; 1928); a seated portrait of Ambassador John Work Garrett (1872\u20131942); a Spanish landscape; a painting based on the opera ''Goyescas''; and a landscape of [[Calatayud]] (Spain).\n\nAn [[Iberia]] airline [[Airbus A340-642]] aircraft, registration EC-IZY, is named after him.\n\n==Zuloaga during and after the Spanish Civil War==\n\nZuloaga was committed to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[Spanish State]] of the ''[[caudillo]]'' [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], whose portrait he painted in 1940. During the war, Zuloaga honored the defenders of the ''[[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar]]'' in 1936, when the building's Nationalist defenders refused to surrender despite the building being in flames. This siege, and other events such as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Moscard\u00f3 Ituarte|General Moscardo's]] son, served as a rallying cry for the Nationalist forces.  In January 1939, this painting was hung in adjacent room displaying Picasso's modernist painting of [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]] during an exhibition of Spanish art in London.<ref>Crosson, D. page 148.</ref> The nationalist content of his depiction of the Alcazar was allied to Zuloaga's celebration of folk traditions. Stylistically, the directness of the ''Siege'' painting also avoids modernity's challenge to realistic depictions: [[Fascism]] was not endeared to complex symbolism such as found in works such as ''Guernica''.\n\nIn an April 1939 letter to his patron, Mrs Garret, Zuloaga stated:<blockquote>Thanks to God, and to Franco, at last the war is won and over! And over, despite the goodwill of those so-called democratic countries \u2013 what a farce, what shame, when those countries learn the truth of this drama! We all will work with all our strength to rebuild a new Spain (free, great and unified) to Spanishize Spain, and get rid of all outside influences, so that we can keep our great nature. That\u2019s my dream in art. I hate fads (which are destructive to racial characteristics) One must (for good or bad) be oneself, and not ape the style of anyone else. I will dedicate the years that are left to me to that end. What shame there will be in the future, for those countries who inflicted crime, savage vandalism, which reigned within the soviet clan in Spain!<ref>Crosson, page 151.</ref></blockquote>  He was later to claim that he was aghast, as a [[francophile]], when Hitler defeated France in 1940. After his death in 1945, he appeared on Spain's [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107040336/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/spain/SpainP148-500Pesetas-1954-donated_f.jpg 500 peseta] banknote emitted by [[Francoist Spain]] in its 1954 series, with a depiction of Toledo on the back.\n\nBrinton in his 1909 essay was prescient of Zuloaga's future enamourment with [[Falangism]]: <blockquote>He personifies in extreme form the spirit of autocracy in art, the principle of absolutism so typical of his race and country. You will meet in these bold, affirmative canvases no hint of cowardice or compromise. The work is defiant, almost despotic. It does not strive to enlist sympathy nor does it fear to be frankly antipathetic...the tones not infrequently acidulous, and the surfaces sometimes hard and metallic. Reactionary if you will...<ref>Brinton 1909, page 30.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Zuloaga, Ignacio}}\n*{{cite book|last=Brinton |first=Christian|title= ''Exhibition of Paintings by Ignacio Zuloaga under the auspices of Mrs Philip M Lydig.''

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.

The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]].

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']].

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

These were made of [[teak]], but in other parts of China, different kinds of wood are used. It is one of a family of traditional paddled long boats found throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]], the Pacific islands, and [[Puerto Rico]]. The sport of dragon boat racing has its roots in an ancient folk ritual of contending villagers, which dates back 2000 years throughout southern China, and even further to the original games of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Both dragon boat racing and the ancient [[Olympiad]] included aspects of religious observances and community celebrations, along with competition.\n\nDragon boat racing has been a traditional Chinese paddled watercraft activity for over 2000 years and began as a modern international sport in [[Hong Kong]] in 1976. These boats are typically made of [[carbon fiber]], [[fiberglass]], and other lightweight materials. For [[competition]] events, dragon boats are generally rigged with decorative [[Chinese dragon]] heads and tails. At other times (such as during training), decorative regalia is usually removed, although the drum often remains aboard for drummers to practice. For races, there are 18-20 people in a standard boat, and 8-10 in a small boat, not including the steersperson (helm) and the drummer.\n\nIn December 2007, the central government of the People's Republic of China added the [[Dragon Boat Festival]], along with the [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]] and [[Mid-Autumn festival|Mid-Autumn]] festivals, to the schedule of national holidays.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei (front).jpg|thumb|right|250px|World's longest dragon boat ([[Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei]]) on display next to [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh|Royal Palace]] in [[Phnom Penh]], Cambodia.]]\nSimilar to the use of [[outrigger canoe]]s or [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] [[va'a]], dragon boat racing has a rich background of ancient ceremonial, ritualistic and religious traditions, and thus, the modern competitive aspect is but one small part of this complex dragon boat culture. The use of dragon boats for racing and dragons are believed by scholars, [[sinologists]], and anthropologists to have originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago, in [[Dongting Lake]] and along the banks of the Chang Jiang (now called the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]) during the same era when the games of [[ancient Greece]] were being established at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].<ref>Worcester, George. ''The Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze River'', 1971.</ref> Dragon boat racing has been practiced continuously since this period as the basis for annual water rituals and festival celebrations, and for the traditional veneration of the [[Dragon king|Chinese dragon water deity]].  The celebration was an important part of the ancient Chinese agricultural society, celebrating the summer rice planting. Dragon boat racing was historically situated in the Chinese subcontinent's southern-central \"rice bowl\"; where there were rice paddies, so there were dragon boats, too.\n\nOf the twelve animals which make up the traditional [[Chinese zodiac]], only the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] is a mythical creature. All the rest are non-mythical animals, yet all twelve of the zodiac creatures were well known to members of ancient Chinese agrarian communities.  Dragons were traditionally believed to be the rulers of water on earth: rivers, lakes, and seas; they were also thought to dominate the waters of the heavens: clouds, mists, and rains. There are earth dragons, mountain dragons, and sky or celestial dragons (Tian Long) in Chinese tradition. Mythical dragons and serpents are also found widely in many cultures around the world.\n\n[[File:Attributed to Li Zhaodao Dragon-boat Race. Palace Museum, Beijing.jpg|thumb|left|Tang dynasty painting of a dragon boat race attributed to Li Zhaodao]]\n\nTraditional dragon boat racing, in China, coincides with the ''5th day of the 5th [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunar month]]'' (varying from late May to June on the modern Gregorian Calendar). The [[summer solstice]] occurs around 21 June and is the reason why Chinese refer to their festival as \"Duan Wu\" or \"Duen Ng\". Both the sun and the dragon are considered to be male (the moon and the mythical phoenix, however, are considered to be female). The sun and the dragon are at their most potent during this time of the year, so cause for observing this through ritual celebrations such as dragon boat racing.  It is also the time of year when rice seedlings must be transplanted in their paddy fields to allow for wet rice cultivation. Wu or Ng refers to the sun at its highest position in the sky during the day, the meridian of 'high noon'. Duan or Duen refers to upright or directly overhead. Thus, Duan Wu is an ancient reference to the maximum position of the sun in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]], the longest day of the year or the summer solstice.\n\nVenerating the dragon deity was meant to avert misfortune and calamity and encourage [[rainfall]], which is needed for the fertility of the crops and thus, for the prosperity of an agrarian way of life.  Celestial dragons were considered the controllers of rain, monsoons, winds, and clouds.  The Emperor was \"The Dragon\" or the \"Son of Heaven\", and Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as \"dragons\" because of its spirit of strength and vitality.  Unlike dragons in [[European mythology]], which are typically considered to be evil and demonic, Asian dragons are regarded as wholesome and benevolent, and thus worthy of veneration, not slaying. If rainfall is insufficient, however, drought and famine can result. Veneration of dragons in China seems to be associated with annually ensuring life-giving water and bountiful rice harvests in south-central China.\n\nAnother ritual called ''[[Awakening of the Dragon]]'' involves a [[Daoshi|Taoist priest]] dotting the bulging eyes of the carved dragon head attached to the boat. Doing so symbolizes the dragon ending its slumber and reenergizing its spirit, or ch'i. In modern dragon boat festivals, a representative can be invited to step forward to dot the eyes on a dragon boat head with a brush dipped in red paint.\n\nNot understanding the significance of Duanwu, 19th-century European observers of the racing ritual referred to the associated spectacle as a \"dragon boat festival\". This is the term that has become known in the West. Dragon boat racing, like Duanwu, is observed and celebrated in many areas of east Asia with a significant population of [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Riau Islands]], as well as having been adopted by the [[Ryukyu Islands]] since ancient times. The date on which races were held is referred to as the \"double fifth\", since Duanwu is reckoned as the fifth day of the fifth [[lunar calendar|lunar month]], which often falls on the [[Gregorian calendar]] month of June and occasionally in May or July. Duanwu is reckoned annually in accordance with the traditional [[Chinese calendar|calendar system of China]], which is a combination of solar and lunar cycles, unlike the solar-based [[Gregorian calendar]] system.\n\n==Crew==\nThe [[crew]] of a standard dragon boat typically consists of 22 team members: 20 paddlers in pairs facing toward the bow of the boat, 1 drummer or caller at the bow facing toward the paddlers, and 1 steerer standing at the rear of the boat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-outdoors-dragon-boat-racing-starting-from-zero-20190510-story.html|title=Dragon boat racing calls to beginners and pros alike|date=2019-05-10|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref> Dragon boats, however, do vary in length and the crew size changes accordingly, from small dragon boats with only 10 paddlers up to traditional boats which have upwards of 50 paddlers, plus drummer(s) and steerer.\n\n\n\n=== Drummer ===\nThe pulsation of the [[drum]] beats produced by the '''drummer''' may be considered the \"[[Pulse|heartbeat]]\" of the dragon boat. The drummer leads the paddlers throughout a race using the rhythmic drum beat to indicate the frequency and synchronization of all the paddlers' strokes (that is, the cadence, picking up or accelerating the pace, slowing the rate, etc.). The drummer may issue commands to the crew through a combination of hand signals and voice calls, and also generally exhorts the crew to perform at their peak. A drummer is typically mandatory during racing events, but if he or she is not present during training, it is typical for the sweep to direct the crew during a race. The drummer's role is both tactical and ceremonial. In official competitions, such as world championships, drummers must physically beat the drum, else the team may be issued a penalty. In other events or practices, the drummer of an experienced team may not hit the drum, as the team can paddle naturally together, sans a drum beat.\n\nGood drummers should be able to [[synchronize]] their drumming with the strokes of the leading pair of paddlers, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Paddlers===\nPairs of '''paddlers''' sit facing forward in the boat, and use a specific type of [[paddle]] which, unlike equipment used in rowing, is not rigged to the boat in any way. Because the paddlers face the direction of boat-movement, dragon boaters \"paddle,\" and do not \"row.\"\n\nThe paddle now accepted by the [[International Dragon Boat Organization]] has a standardized, fixed blade surface area and distinctive shape derived from the paddle shapes characteristic of that used by inhabitants of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] delta region of Guangdong Province, China adjacent to Hong Kong.

The steering oar is situated in the upside-down U-shaped oar lock. The oar lock is housed on top of the steering arm, which sticks out perpendicularly on the back-left of a dragon boat.\n\nThe oar is used to both steer the boat as it is moving and adjust the positioning of the boat. To steer, a steerer will put the blade of the oar into the water and either push the handle away from him/her, or pull it toward him/her.

These were made of [[teak]], but in other parts of China, different kinds of wood are used. It is one of a family of traditional paddled long boats found throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]], the Pacific islands, and [[Puerto Rico]]. The sport of dragon boat racing has its roots in an ancient folk ritual of contending villagers, which dates back 2000 years throughout southern China, and even further to the original games of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Both dragon boat racing and the ancient [[Olympiad]] included aspects of religious observances and community celebrations, along with competition.\n\nDragon boat racing has been a traditioal chinese paddled watercraft activity for over 2000 years and began as a modern international sport in [[Hong Kong]] in 1976. These boats are typically made of [[carbon fiber]], [[fiberglass]], and other lightweight materials. For [[competition]] events, dragon boats are generally rigged with decorative [[Chinese dragon]] heads and tails. At other times (such as during training), decorative regalia is usually removed, although the drum often remains aboard for drummers to practice. For races, there are 18-20 people in a standard boat, and 8-10 in a small boat, not including the steersperson (helm) and the drummer.\n\nIn December 2007, the central government of the People's Republic of China added the [[Dragon Boat Festival]], along with the [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]] and [[Mid-Autumn festival|Mid-Autumn]] festivals, to the schedule of national holidays.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei (front).jpg|thumb|right|250px|World's longest dragon boat ([[Kambojika Putta Khemara Tarei]]) on display next to [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh|Royal Palace]] in [[Phnom Penh]], Cambodia.]]\nSimilar to the use of [[outrigger canoe]]s or [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] [[va'a]], dragon boat racing has a rich background of ancient ceremonial, ritualistic and religious traditions, and thus, the modern competitive aspect is but one small part of this complex dragon boat culture. The use of dragon boats for racing and dragons are believed by scholars, [[sinologists]], and anthropologists to have originated in southern central China more than 2500 years ago, in [[Dongting Lake]] and along the banks of the Chang Jiang (now called the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]) during the same era when the games of [[ancient Greece]] were being established at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].<ref>Worcester, George. ''The Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze River'', 1971.</ref>  Dragon boat racing has been practiced continuously since this period as the basis for annual water rituals and festival celebrations, and for the traditional veneration of the [[Dragon king|Chinese dragon water deity]].  The celebration was an important part of the ancient Chinese agricultural society, celebrating the summer rice planting. Dragon boat racing was historically situated in the Chinese subcontinent's southern-central \"rice bowl\"; where there were rice paddies, so there were dragon boats, too.\n\nOf the twelve animals which make up the traditional [[Chinese zodiac]], only the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] is a mythical creature. All the rest are non-mythical animals, yet all twelve of the zodiac creatures were well known to members of ancient Chinese agrarian communities.  Dragons were traditionally believed to be the rulers of water on earth: rivers, lakes, and seas; they were also thought to dominate the waters of the heavens: clouds, mists, and rains. There are earth dragons, mountain dragons, and sky or celestial dragons (Tian Long) in Chinese tradition. Mythical dragons and serpents are also found widely in many cultures around the world.\n\n[[File:Attributed to Li Zhaodao Dragon-boat Race. Palace Museum, Beijing.jpg|thumb|left|Tang dynasty painting of a dragon boat race attributed to Li Zhaodao]]\n\nTraditional dragon boat racing, in China, coincides with the ''5th day of the 5th [[Chinese calendar|Chinese lunar month]]'' (varying from late May to June on the modern Gregorian Calendar). The [[summer solstice]] occurs around 21 June and is the reason why Chinese refer to their festival as \"Duan Wu\" or \"Duen Ng\". Both the sun and the dragon are considered to be male (the moon and the mythical phoenix, however, are considered to be female). The sun and the dragon are at their most potent during this time of the year, so cause for observing this through ritual celebrations such as dragon boat racing.  It is also the time of year when rice seedlings must be transplanted in their paddy fields to allow for wet rice cultivation. Wu or Ng refers to the sun at its highest position in the sky during the day, the meridian of 'high noon'. Duan or Duen refers to upright or directly overhead. Thus, Duan Wu is an ancient reference to the maximum position of the sun in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]], the longest day of the year or the summer solstice.\n\nVenerating the dragon deity was meant to avert misfortune and calamity and encourage [[rainfall]], which is needed for the fertility of the crops and thus, for the prosperity of an agrarian way of life.  Celestial dragons were considered the controllers of rain, monsoons, winds, and clouds.  The Emperor was \"The Dragon\" or the \"Son of Heaven\", and Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as \"dragons\" because of its spirit of strength and vitality.  Unlike dragons in [[European mythology]], which are typically considered to be evil and demonic, Asian dragons are regarded as wholesome and benevolent, and thus worthy of veneration, not slaying. If rainfall is insufficient, however, drought and famine can result. Veneration of dragons in China seems to be associated with annually ensuring life-giving water and bountiful rice harvests in south-central China.\n\nAnother ritual called ''[[Awakening of the Dragon]]'' involves a [[Daoshi|Taoist priest]] dotting the bulging eyes of the carved dragon head attached to the boat. Doing so symbolizes the dragon ending its slumber and reenergizing its spirit, or ch'i. In modern dragon boat festivals, a representative can be invited to step forward to dot the eyes on a dragon boat head with a brush dipped in red paint.\n\nNot understanding the significance of Duanwu, 19th-century European observers of the racing ritual referred to the associated spectacle as a \"dragon boat festival\". This is the term that has become known in the West. Dragon boat racing, like Duanwu, is observed and celebrated in many areas of east Asia with a significant population of [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Riau Islands]], as well as having been adopted by the [[Ryukyu Islands]] since ancient times. The date on which races were held is referred to as the \"double fifth\", since Duanwu is reckoned as the fifth day of the fifth [[lunar calendar|lunar month]], which often falls on the [[Gregorian calendar]] month of June and occasionally in May or July. Duanwu is reckoned annually in accordance with the traditional [[Chinese calendar|calendar system of China]], which is a combination of solar and lunar cycles, unlike the solar-based [[Gregorian calendar]] system.\n\n==Crew==\nThe [[crew]] of a standard dragon boat typically consists of 22 team members: 20 paddlers in pairs facing toward the bow of the boat, 1 drummer or caller at the bow facing toward the paddlers, and 1 steerer standing at the rear of the boat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-outdoors-dragon-boat-racing-starting-from-zero-20190510-story.html|title=Dragon boat racing calls to beginners and pros alike|date=2019-05-10|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-22}}</ref> Dragon boats, however, do vary in length and the crew size changes accordingly, from small dragon boats with only 10 paddlers up to traditional boats which have upwards of 50 paddlers, plus drummer(s) and steerer.\n\n\n\n=== Drummer ===\nThe pulsation of the [[drum]] beats produced by the '''drummer''' may be considered the \"[[Pulse|heartbeat]]\" of the dragon boat. The drummer leads the paddlers throughout a race using the rhythmic drum beat to indicate the frequency and synchronization of all the paddlers' strokes (that is, the cadence, picking up or accelerating the pace, slowing the rate, etc.). The drummer may issue commands to the crew through a combination of hand signals and voice calls, and also generally exhorts the crew to perform at their peak. A drummer is typically mandatory during racing events, but if he or she is not present during training, it is typical for the sweep to direct the crew during a race. The drummer's role is both tactical and ceremonial. In official competitions, such as world championships, drummers must physically beat the drum, else the team may be issued a penalty. In other events or practices, the drummer of an experienced team may not hit the drum, as the team can paddle naturally together, sans a drum beat.\n\nGood drummers should be able to [[synchronize]] their drumming with the strokes of the leading pair of paddlers, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Paddlers===\nPairs of '''paddlers''' sit facing forward in the boat, and use a specific type of [[paddle]] which, unlike equipment used in rowing, is not rigged to the boat in any way. Because the paddlers face the direction of boat-movement, dragon boaters \"paddle,\" and do not \"row.\"\n\nThe paddle now accepted by the [[International Dragon Boat Organization]] has a standardized, fixed blade surface area and distinctive shape derived from the paddle shapes characteristic of that used by inhabitants of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] delta region of Guangdong Province, China adjacent to Hong Kong.
