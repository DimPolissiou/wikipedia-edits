A member of the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] family, the M3 CFV is used by heavy armored cavalry units in the [[United States Army]].\n\n==History==\nThe M3 Bradley CFV is very similar to the [[M2 Bradley]] IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) and is fielded with the same two-man 25mm [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]] Cannon turret with a coaxial [[M240 machine gun|M240C]] 7.62mm machine gun. It only varies from the M2 in a few subtle ways and by role. The M3 is classified as an armored reconnaissance and scout vehicle and does away with the firing ports found in the M2 series. The M3 also carries more [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missiles as well as more ammunition for its 25mm and 7.62mm guns.\n\nThe Bradley family as a whole was originally intended to support the [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), but ended up replacing it in U.S. Army service altogether. Today, the Bradley is fielded in conjunction with the [[M1 Abrams]] series of main battle tanks and often accompanies infantry squads into combat. In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Bradleys destroyed more enemy tanks than the M1 Abrams.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Only three Bradleys were lost to enemy fire, however, at least 17 were lost to friendly fire. Improvements to the Bradley family have included enhanced identification features, as well as anti-tank missile countermeasures (for first generation wire-guided missiles only) and improved armor protection in the form of [[explosive reactive armor|ERA]].\n\n===Replacement===\nThe United States and United Kingdom worked jointly on the Future Scout Cavalry System in the 1990s. The U.S. Army's intended replacement for the M3 Bradley and up-armored [[Humvee]] reached the engineering and manufacturing development phase. It reached the engineering and manufacturing development phase before both partners terminated involvement in October 2001 to pursue other more urgent programs: the U.S. [[Interim Armored Vehicle]] and UK [[Future Rapid Effect System]].<ref name=\"FSCS\">{{cite news|last1=Baumgardner|first1=Neil|title=United States, Britain Agree To Terminate Future Scout Cavalry System|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79237089.html|accessdate=12 May 2017|work=Defense Daily|date=18 October 2001|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920152728/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79237089.html|archivedate=20 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2003 [[Future Combat Systems]] (FCS) planned a successor to the M3 Bradley in the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles#Reconnaissance and surveillance vehicle|XM1201 Reconnaissance and Surveillance Vehicle]].

Called the [[UCL University Preparatory Certificate (UPC)|UCL University Preparatory Certificate]], the courses are targeted at international students of high academic potential whose education systems in their own countries usually do not offer qualifications suitable for direct admission. There are two pathways \u2013 one in science and engineering called the UPCSE; and one in the humanities called UPCH.

Called the [[UCL University Preparatory Certificate (UPC)|UCL University Preparatory Certificate]], the courses are targeted at international students of high academic potential whose education systems in their own countries usually do not offer qualifications suitable for direct admission. There are two pathways \u2013 one in science and engineering called the UPCSE; and one in the humanities called UPCH.

Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer. By calling \"Oh, Toodles!\" Mickey summons him to pop up from where he is hiding and fly up to the screen so the viewer can pick which tool Mickey needs for the current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atv.disney.go.com/playhouse/mickeymouseclubhouse/stories/ohtoodles/index.html|title=Oh Toodles!

Another one is a \"Mouseke-Think-About-It Tool\" represented by a silhouette of Mickey's head with rotating gears, in which characters must think of what to use before telling the Tool \"Mouseke-Think-About-It-Tool, we pick the (object)\". Once the tools have been shown to Mickey on the Mousekedoer screen, they are quickly downloaded to Toodles, a small, Mickey-head-shaped flying extension of the Mousekedoer.

However it can, like the HAV 304, be fitted for a wide variety of defence roles.\n\n==Design==\n=== Overview ===\n[[File:Airlander - Mission Module Fitting.jpg|thumb|Airlander 10 in Hangar One at [[Cardington Airfield]], January 2016]]\n\nThe HAV 304 / Airlander 10 is a [[hybrid airship]], achieving lift, and thereby flight, via both [[aerostatic]] and [[aerodynamic]] forces. Unlike most airship designs, it does not have a circular cross-section, having adopted an [[elliptic]]al shape with a contoured and flattened hull. This shaping is deliberate so that it acts  as a [[lifting body]], contributing aerodynamic lift while the airship is in forward motion; generating up to half of the airship's lift in a similar manner to that of a conventional [[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing aeroplane]].<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/><ref name=\"revival 2011\"/> [[Buoyancy]] is also provided by [[helium]] contained within the envelope, [[Blimp|the pressure from which maintains the airship's unique shape]], between 60 percent and 80 percent of the aircraft's weight is supported by the lighter-than-air helium.<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/><ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The Airlander 10 is equipped with a set of [[pneumatic]] skids that are designed to let the airship land and take off from a wide variety of terrain, as well as from water.<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/>\n\nThe Airlander 10 is capable of staying aloft for five days while crewed, and over two weeks while unmanned.<ref name=\"nyt crash 16\"/> The type had the potential for various civil and military applications; these include transportation purposes, conducting aerial surveillance, acting as a communications relay, supporting disaster relief operations, and various passenger services such as leisure flights and luxury [[VIP]] duties.<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/> Many of these duties could involve different configurations of the airship's mission module to suit.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> Northrop also said the LEMV could be used as a cargo aircraft, claiming that it had enough buoyancy to haul {{convert|7|t|kg lb||}}{{clarify|is this the correct \"tons\"?|date=January 2019}} of cargo {{Convert|2400|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip|-2}} at {{Convert|50|km/h|-1|abbr=on|}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Axe\n | first= David\n | title= Video: Army's Giant Spy Blimp Soars Over Jersey Shore in First Flight\n | publisher= Wired.com\n | date= 8 August 2012\n | url= https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/army-spy-blimp/#more-88762\n | accessdate= 13 August 2012\n}}\n</ref>\nAccording to HAV, the design would allow operators to choose among trade-offs between endurance and cargo capacity, carrying up to a maximum of {{cvt|30000|lb|order=flip||}} of cargo.<ref name=\"eng 2010\"/>\n\n===Flight deck and controls===\n\nThe Airlander 10 possesses a sizeable flight deck with four large floor-to-ceiling windows, providing a high level of external visibility.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> While the airship had originally been envisioned to be [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]], HAV adopted an [[optionally piloted vehicle|optionally piloted]] approach as a result of customer interest in such operations. In 2015, positions for a single pilot and an observer had been installed in the Airlander 10; HAV intend to adopt a twin-pilot configuration along with a greater prevalence of [[glass cockpit]]-style controls and instrumentation in the future.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The airship is controlled by a [[side-stick]] mounted on the right-hand side, somewhat resembling that of a [[rotorcraft]]; there are no [[rudder]] pedals, the side-stick being automatically slaved to the [[Vortex generator|vanes]] instead. [[Garmin]]-built avionics furnish the cockpit; the suite includes a [[closed-circuit television]] system that enables the pilot to view the otherwise-distant engines.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\nThe propulsion units and flying surfaces are both connected to the [[flight control system]] via [[fly-by-optics]], using [[optical fibre]] cables to efficiently cope with the vast scale of the vehicle.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The pilot's controls are various [[switch]]es and [[potentiometer]]s, which are connected to the [[Aircraft flight control system|Flight Control System]] to produce digital signals encoded into light pulses by one of three FCS-Masters and transmitted to the appropriate FCS-Satellite(s) located around the vehicle. These 11 FCS-Satellites then connect electrically to the appropriate equipment including flying surface actuators, engine controls, Secondary Power Distributors etc. Outputs from these various units also take the return path back to the flight deck via the [[Aircraft flight control system|Flight Control System]] to provide feedback to the pilot on engine conditions, flying surface positions, Secondary Power conditions etc. Transitioning between the vehicle's multiple modes of flight is regulated directly by the flight control system, enabling the vehicle to be operated locally, remotely or in an unmanned configuration.<ref name = \"eng 2010\"/> According to HAV, the designing of the flight control regime was eased by the natural pendulum stability of the airship.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\n===Structure===\nThe hull of the airship comprises a skin made of triple-layered combination of [[composite material]]s. The skin  keep in the gas, and provides rigidity so the craft retains its shape when inflated. The four engines, fins and the flight deck are attached directly upon it.<ref name = \"guard unveil 2016\"/> Materials used include [[Vectran]], [[Kevlar]], [[polyvinyl fluoride|Tedlar]], [[Polyurethane]], and [[Mylar]]; the Mylar layer, enveloped within polyurethane film layers, forms the airship's gas barrier.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The Airlander 10 only has diaphragms and ballonets (see below) as internal framework; weight from the payload module is distributed across every frame via cables running across and into the hull as well. According to HAV's Technical Director Mike Durham, the entirety of the airship's structural strength is derived from being inflated to just above atmospheric pressure with a 4-in [[Inch of water|water gauge pressure]] (around 0.15 psi/1000 Pascals/1% atm) differential; this strength is due to the diameter of the vessel despite the relatively-low pressure differential.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\nThe hull is internally divided by [[diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]]s into a total of six main compartments with additional sub-divisions; these divisions can be sealed in the event of emergencies, such as battle damage being sustained, allowing for the majority of the airship's helium, and thereby lift capacity, to be retained.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> [[Ballonet]]s are housed within these compartments in order to regulate gas pressure; these are inflated on the ground to increase density and reduce lift.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Air and helium are not allowed to mix in the ballonets, thus enabling each to be furnished with valves and fans in order to increase and decrease air volume independently; this approach is claimed by HAV to be unique to the airship.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\nAccording to estimates performed by Northrop, the biggest foreseen threat to the HAV 304 is adverse weather conditions, such as high winds or thunderstorms, that could buffet the craft.<ref>Axe, David.

However it can, like the HAV 304, be fitted for a wide variety of defence roles.\n\n==Design==\n=== Overview ===\n[[File:Airlander - Mission Module Fitting.jpg|thumb|Airlander 10 in Hangar One at [[Cardington Airfield]], January 2016]]\n\nThe HAV 304 / Airlander 10 is a [[hybrid airship]], achieving lift, and thereby flight, via both [[aerostatic]] and [[aerodynamic]] forces. Unlike most airship designs, it does not have a circular cross-section, having adopted an [[elliptic]]al shape with a contoured and flattened hull. This shaping is deliberate so that it acts  as a [[lifting body]], contributing aerodynamic lift while the airship is in forward motion; generating up to half of the airship's lift in a similar manner to that of a conventional [[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing aeroplane]].<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/><ref name=\"revival 2011\"/> [[Buoyancy]] is also provided by [[helium]] contained within the envelope, [[Blimp|the pressure from which maintains the airship's unique shape]], between 60 percent and 80 percent of the aircraft's weight is supported by the lighter-than-air helium.<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/><ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The Airlander 10 is equipped with a set of [[pneumatic]] skids that are designed to let the airship land and take off from a wide variety of terrain, as well as from water.<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/>\n\nThe Airlander 10 is capable of staying aloft for five days while crewed, and over two weeks while unmanned.<ref name=\"nyt crash 16\"/> The type had the potential for various civil and military applications; these include transportation purposes, conducting aerial surveillance, acting as a communications relay, supporting disaster relief operations, and various passenger services such as leisure flights and luxury [[VIP]] duties.<ref name=\"guard unveil 2016\"/> Many of these duties could involve different configurations of the airship's mission module to suit.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> Northrop also said the LEMV could be used as a cargo aircraft, claiming that it had enough buoyancy to haul {{convert|7|t|kg lb||}}{{clarify|is this the correct \"tons\"?|date=January 2019}} of cargo {{Convert|2400|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip|-2}} at {{Convert|50|km/h|-1|abbr=on|}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Axe\n | first= David\n | title= Video: Army's Giant Spy Blimp Soars Over Jersey Shore in First Flight\n | publisher= Wired.com\n | date= 8 August 2012\n | url= https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/army-spy-blimp/#more-88762\n | accessdate= 13 August 2012\n}}\n</ref>\nAccording to HAV, the design would allow operators to choose among trade-offs between endurance and cargo capacity, carrying up to a maximum of {{cvt|30000|lb|order=flip||}} of cargo.<ref name=\"eng 2010\"/>\n\n===Flight deck and controls===\n\nThe Airlander 10 possesses a sizeable flight deck with four large floor-to-ceiling windows, providing a high level of external visibility.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> While the airship had originally been envisioned to be [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]], HAV adopted an [[optionally piloted vehicle|optionally piloted]] approach as a result of customer interest in such operations. In 2015, positions for a single pilot and an observer had been installed in the Airlander 10; HAV intend to adopt a twin-pilot configuration along with a greater prevalence of [[glass cockpit]]-style controls and instrumentation in the future.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The airship is controlled by a [[side-stick]] mounted on the right-hand side, somewhat resembling that of a [[rotorcraft]]; there are no [[rudder]] pedals, the side-stick being automatically slaved to the [[Vortex generator|vanes]] instead. [[Garmin]]-built avionics furnish the cockpit; the suite includes a [[closed-circuit television]] system that enables the pilot to view the otherwise-distant engines.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\nThe propulsion units and flying surfaces are both connected to the [[flight control system]] via [[fly-by-optics]], using [[optical fibre]] cables to efficiently cope with the vast scale of the vehicle.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The pilot's controls are various [[switch]]es and [[potentiometer]]s, which are connected to the [[Aircraft flight control system|Flight Control System]] to produce digital signals encoded into light pulses by one of three FCS-Masters and transmitted to the appropriate FCS-Satellite(s) located around the vehicle. These 11 FCS-Satellites then connect electrically to the appropriate equipment including flying surface actuators, engine controls, Secondary Power Distributors etc. Outputs from these various units also take the return path back to the flight deck via the [[Aircraft flight control system|Flight Control System]] to provide feedback to the pilot on engine conditions, flying surface positions, Secondary Power conditions etc. Transitioning between the vehicle's multiple modes of flight is regulated directly by the flight control system, enabling the vehicle to be operated locally, remotely or in an unmanned configuration.<ref name = \"eng 2010\"/> According to HAV, the designing of the flight control regime was eased by the natural pendulum stability of the airship.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\n===Structure===\nThe hull of the airship comprises a skin made of triple-layered combination of [[composite material]]s. The skin  keep in the gas, and provides rigidity so the craft retains its shape when inflated. The four engines, fins and the flight deck are attached directly upon it.<ref name = \"guard unveil 2016\"/> Materials used include [[Vectran]], [[Kevlar]], [[polyvinyl fluoride|Tedlar]], [[Polyurethane]], and [[Mylar]]; the Mylar layer, enveloped within polyurethane film layers, forms the airship's gas barrier.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> The Airlander 10 only has diaphragms and ballonets (see below) as internal framework; weight from the payload module is distributed across every frame via cables running across and into the hull as well. According to HAV's Technical Director Mike Durham, the entirety of the airship's structural strength is derived from being inflated to just above atmospheric pressure with a 4-in [[Inch of water|water gauge pressure]] (around 0.15 psi/1000 Pascals/1% atm) differential; this strength is due to the diameter of the vessel despite the relatively-low pressure differential.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\nThe hull is internally divided by [[diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]]s into a total of six main compartments with additional sub-divisions; these divisions can be sealed in the event of emergencies, such as battle damage being sustained, allowing for the majority of the airship's helium, and thereby lift capacity, to be retained.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/> [[Ballonet]]s are housed within these compartments in order to regulate gas pressure; these are inflated on the ground to increase density and reduce lift.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Air and helium are not allowed to mix in the ballonets, thus enabling each to be furnished with valves and fans in order to increase and decrease air volume independently; this approach is claimed by HAV to be unique to the airship.<ref name=aw2015-05-15/>\n\nAccording to estimates performed by Northrop, the biggest foreseen threat to the HAV 304 is adverse weather conditions, such as high winds or thunderstorms, that could buffet the craft.<ref>Axe, David.

An intense gun battle erupted, resulting in the deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians. Upon the ATF's failure to raid the compound, a siege lasting 51 days was initiated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Eventually, the FBI launched an assault and initiated a [[tear gas]] attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch. During the attack, a fire engulfed Mount Carmel Center.

In 1959, Victor's widow, Florence Houteff, announced that the expected [[Armageddon]] was about to take place, and members were told to gather at the center to await this event. Many built houses, others stayed in tents, trucks, or buses, and most sold their possessions.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\"/>\n\nFollowing the failure of this prophecy, control of the site ([[Mount Carmel Center]]) fell to [[Benjamin Roden]], founder of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association (Branch Davidians). He promoted different doctrinal beliefs than Victor Houteff's original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization. On Roden's death, control fell to his wife, [[Lois Roden]]. Lois considered their son, [[George Roden]], unfit to assume the position of [[prophet]]. Instead, she groomed Vernon Howell (later known as [[David Koresh]]) as her chosen successor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1984, a meeting led to a division of the group, with Howell leading one faction (calling themselves the Branch Davidians) and George Roden leading the competing faction.

This store, named the \"Mag-Bag\", had been identified by said postal worker as suspicious in deliveries. The postal worker continued deliveries to the Mt. Carmel Center and reported seeing manned observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed they were armed personnel at these observations posts.\n\nThe McClennan county sheriff was notified in May and June of that year of two cases of inert grenades, black gunpowder, 90 pounds of powdered aluminum metal, and 30-40 cardboard tubes. Furthermore, the sheriff noticed another shipment of sixty AR-15/M-16 magazines, to which Davy Aguilera made the statement, \"I have been involved in many cases where defendants, following a relatively simple process, convert AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to fully automatic rifles of the nature of the M-16\" to justify the ATF's involvement in the case.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother report was made to the Sheriff in November of 1992 by a local farmer who believed he heard machine gun fire. \"By the sound of it,\" he said, \"it was likely a .50 caliber machine gun and multiple M-16's.\" This farmer claimed he was very familiar with machine guns, having done a tour overseas in the U.S Army.\nThe affidavit closes with Aguilera verifying the story via interviews made with associated parties and gun shops from which the Mag-Bag purchased items. Among these items were over forty-five AR-15 upper receivers and five M-16 upper receivers, which Aguilera clearly annotates, \"These kits contain all the parts of an M-16 machine gun except for the lower receiver unit which is the \"firearm\" by lawful definition,\" admitting that neither the noise complaints nor the items ordered were necessarily illegal. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nDepartment of Human Services is noted in the affidavit as well. BATF happened to get statements from a department worker who managed to investigate a case on the Carmel site.  This agent, Joyce Sparks, had two separate visits to the grounds where she questioned members of the Branch Davidians and toured the compound. The first visit involved interviewing a young boy of the compound \"who was in a rush to grow up so he can have a long gun.\" This issue was not looked into until Ms. Joyce's second visit, when she was able to speak to David Koresh himself. He nonchalantly mentioned there were only a few guns, but when Ms. Joyce asked if it is okay to tour the compound, he requested she wait for thirty minutes so he can hide any guns from members not shown the guns. During this tour was when Ms. Joyce looked inside a trap door and noticed a buried bus with a refrigerator at the end. It was obvious to Ms. Joyce that the refrigerator was used as target practice by the Davidians, with the bullet holes in it and the guns strewn along the floor of this makeshift basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== ATF raid ==\n=== Preparations ===\n[[File:Branch Davidian Compound Near Waco.jpg|thumb|The Branch Davidian compound as photographed during the ensuing siege]]\n\nUsing the [[affidavit]] filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated [[Law of the United States|federal law]], the ATF obtained search and [[arrest warrant]]s for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated.<ref>Search Warrant W93-15M for the \"residence of Vernon Wayne Howell, and others\", signed by U.S. Judge or Magistrate Dennis G.

One agent was killed and another wounded. The third agent scampered over the peak of the roof and joined other agents attempting to enter the arms room. The window was smashed, a flashbang [[stun grenade]] was thrown in, and three agents entered the arms room. When another tried to follow them, a hail of bullets penetrated the wall and wounded him, but he was able to reach a ladder and slide to safety. An agent fired with his shotgun at Branch Davidians until he was hit in the head by return fire and killed.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/> Inside the arms room, the agents killed a Branch Davidian and discovered a cache of weapons but then came under heavy fire; two were wounded. As they escaped, the third agent laid down covering fire, killing a Branch Davidian. As he made his escape, he hit his head on a wooden support beam and fell off the roof but survived. An agent outside provided them with covering fire but was shot by a Branch Davidian and killed instantly. Dozens of ATF agents took cover, many behind Branch Davidian vehicles, and exchanged fire with the Branch Davidians. The number of ATF wounded increased, and an agent was killed by gunfire from the compound as agents were firing at a Branch Davidian perched on top of the water tower. The exchange of fire continued, but 45 minutes into the raid the gunfire began to slow down as agents began to run low on ammunition. The shooting continued for two hours.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nSheriff Lt. Lynch of the McLennan County Sheriff Department contacted the ATF and negotiated a ceasefire.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Sheriff Harwell states in [[William Gazecki]]'s documentary ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'' that the ATF agents withdrew only after they were out of ammunition.<ref name=\"roe\">{{cite video | people = William Gazecki | title = Waco \u2013 The Rules of Engagement | medium = Film documentary | publisher = New Yorker Video |year=2003 }}</ref> ATF agent Chuck Hustmyre later wrote: \"About 45 minutes into the shootout, the volume of gunfire finally started to slacken. We were running out of ammunition. The Davidians, however, had plenty.\" In all, four ATF agents (Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway Charles LeBleu) had been killed during the firefight. Another 16 had been injured. After the ceasefire, the Branch Davidians allowed the ATF dead and wounded to be evacuated and held their fire during the ATF retreat.\n\nThe five Branch Davidians killed in the raid were Winston Blake, Peter Gent, Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones, and Jaydean Wendell; two were killed at the hands of the Branch Davidians after having been wounded.<ref>Coulson, Danny O & Shannon, Elaine, ''No Heroes'' {{ISBN|0-671-02062-5}}</ref> Their bodies were buried on the grounds.

The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing [[Jeff Jamar]], head of the Bureau's [[San Antonio]] [[List of FBI field offices|field office]], in charge of the siege as Site Commander. The FBI [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the [[Ruby Ridge|Ruby Ridge incident]]. As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.\n\nAt first, the Davidians had telephone contact with local news media, and Koresh gave phone interviews. The FBI cut Davidian communication to the outside world. For the next 51 days, communication with those inside was by telephone by a group of 25 FBI negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The final [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report found that negotiators criticized the tactical commanders for undercutting negotiations.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit Report of the Department of the Treasury on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Investigation of Vernon Wayne Howell also known as David Koresh, September, 1993] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042646/https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit |date=April 2, 2016 }}, Appendix D, 136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nIn the first few days, the FBI believed they had made a breakthrough when they negotiated with Koresh an agreement that the Branch Davidians would peacefully leave the compound in return for a message, recorded by Koresh, being broadcast on national radio.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The broadcast was made, but Koresh then told negotiators that God had told him to remain in the building and \"wait\".<ref name=\"iw\" /> Despite this, soon afterwards negotiators managed to facilitate the release of 19 children, ranging in age from five months to 12 years old, without their parents.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> However, 98 people remained in the building.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children were then interviewed by the FBI and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], some for hours at a time.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the standoff.<ref name=\"child_abuse\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas/Child Abuse|author=FBI|accessdate=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817102810/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|archive-date=August 17, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=FBI}}</ref> This was the key justification offered by the FBI (both to President [[Bill Clinton]] and to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]]) for launching [[tear gas]] attacks to force the Branch Davidians out of the compound.<ref name=\"lost\">{{Cite news | work = The Guardian | title = Lost in America | author = Nick Davies | date = January 14, 1994 | url = http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | access-date = March 19, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042258/http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | archive-date = March 4, 2016 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all | author-link = Nick Davies }}</ref>\n\nDuring the siege, the FBI sent a video camera to the Branch Davidians. In the video tape made by Koresh's followers, Koresh introduced his children and his \"wives\" to the FBI negotiators, including several [[minor (law)|minors]] who claimed to have had babies fathered by Koresh. (Koresh had fathered perhaps 14 of the children who stayed with him in the compound.) Several Branch Davidians made statements in the video.<ref>[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]] contains several sequences taken from the FBI negotiation videotape.</ref> On day nine, Monday March 8, the Branch Davidians sent out the video tape to show the FBI that there were no hostages, but in fact everyone was staying inside of their own free will.

His conversations\u2014dense with Biblical imagery\u2014alienated the federal negotiators, who treated the situation as a hostage crisis; just amongst themselves, the negotiation teams took to calling these diatribes \"Bible babble\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Noesner|first = Gary|title = Stalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiator|publisher = Random House|pages = 114|language = English|isbn = 978-0-525-51128-1|year = 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the siege wore on, two factions developed within the FBI,<ref name=\"iw\" /> one believing negotiation to be the answer, the other, force. Increasingly aggressive techniques were used to try to force the Branch Davidians out. For instance, [[sleep deprivation]] of the inhabitants by means of all-night broadcasts of recordings of jet planes, pop music, chanting, and the screams of rabbits being slaughtered. Outside the compound, nine [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s carrying [[United States 40&nbsp;mm grenades#Less Lethal and Riot Control Cartridges|M651 CS tear gas grenades]] and [[Riot gun#Ferret rounds|Ferret rounds]] and five [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]]s obtained from the [[U.S. Army]] began patrolling.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The armored vehicles were used to destroy perimeter fencing and outbuildings and crush cars belonging to the Branch Davidians. Armored vehicles repeatedly drove over the grave of Branch Davidian Peter Gent despite protests by the Branch Davidians and the negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nTwo of the three water storage tanks on the roof of the main building had been damaged during the initial ATF raid. Eventually the FBI cut all power and water to the compound, forcing those inside to survive on rain water and stockpiled military [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] rations.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Criticism was later leveled by Schneider's attorney, Jack Zimmerman, at the tactic of using sleep-and-peace-disrupting sound against the Branch Davidians: \"The point was this \u2013 they were trying to have sleep disturbance and they were trying to take someone that they viewed as unstable to start with, and they were trying to drive him crazy. And then they got mad 'cos he does something that they think is irrational!\"<ref>Testimony to the Subcommittee on National Security ''et al.'', loc cite. Congressional Record, July 1995.</ref>\n\nDespite the increasingly aggressive tactics, Koresh ordered a group of followers to leave. Eleven people left and were arrested as material witnesses, with one person charged with [[conspiracy to murder]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children's willingness to stay with Koresh disturbed the negotiators, who were unprepared to work around the Branch Davidians' religious zeal. However, as the siege went on, the children were aware that an earlier group of children who had left with some women were immediately separated, and the women arrested.\n\nDuring the siege, a number of scholars who study [[apocalypticism]] in religious groups attempted to persuade the FBI that the siege tactics being used by government agents would only reinforce the impression within the Branch Davidians that they were part of a Biblical \"[[End time|end-of-times]]\" confrontation that had cosmic significance.<ref name=\"usatodayreligion\">{{Cite news | title = U.S. ignores religion's fringes | work = USA Today | date = October 4, 2001 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | accessdate = May 27, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614235202/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | archive-date = June 14, 2010 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> This would likely increase the chances of a violent and deadly outcome.

He proclaimed that he was the Second Coming of Christ and had been commanded by his father in heaven to remain in the compound.<ref name=\"iw\" /> One week prior to the April 19 assault, FBI planners considered using snipers to kill David Koresh and possibly other key Branch Davidians.<ref>Lee Hancock, \"No Easy Answers: Law Authorities Puzzle over Methods to End Branch Davidians Siege,\" ''Dallas Morning News'', April 15, 1993.</ref> The FBI voiced concern that the Branch Davidians might commit [[mass suicide]], as had happened in 1978 at [[Jim Jones]]'s [[Jonestown]] complex. Koresh had repeatedly denied any plans for mass suicide when confronted by negotiators during the standoff, and people leaving the compound had not seen any such preparation.<ref name=\"deputy_suicide\" />\n\n== Final assault and burning of Mount Carmel ==\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| align = right\n| image1 = Mountcarmelfire04-19-93-d.jpg\n| image2 = Mountcarmelfire04-19-93-k.jpg\n| image3 = Mountcarmelfire04-19-93-p.jpg\n| footer = \n| direction = vertical\n| caption1 = An [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]] brings down the back wall and roof of the Mount Carmel gymnasium\n| caption2 = Smoke rises from the compound\n| caption3 = Last remnants of the razed Mount Carmel Center burn down\n}}\nNewly appointed U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno approved recommendations by the FBI Hostage Rescue Team to mount an assault, after being told that conditions were deteriorating and that children were being abused inside the compound.<ref name=\"child_abuse\" /> Reno made the FBI's case to President Clinton. Recalling the April 19, 1985, [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (CSAL) siege in [[Arkansas]] (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), President Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians. Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSAL; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent. Clinton later recounted: \"Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.\"<ref>Bill Clinton, ''My Life'', Alfred A. Knopf, Vintage Books (Random House), {{ISBN|1-4000-3003-X}}, 2005.

Because the Branch Davidians were heavily armed, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's arms included [[.50 caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV). The CEVs used explosives to punch holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in [[CS gas]] (\"tear gas\") and try to force the Branch Davidians out without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Officially, no armed assault was to be made. Loudspeakers were to be used to tell the Branch Davidians that there would be no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. According to the FBI, the Hostage Rescue Team agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19. When several Branch Davidians opened fire, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's response was only to increase the amount of gas being used.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nThe FBI Hostage Rescue Team delivered {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} CS grenade fire from [[M79 grenade launcher]]s. Very early in the morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team fired two military M651 rounds at the Branch Davidian construction site. Around mid-morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team began to run low on 40&nbsp;mm Ferret CS rounds and asked Texas Ranger Captain David Byrnes for tear gas rounds. The tear gas rounds procured from Company \"F\" in Waco turned out to be unusable pyrotechnic rounds and were returned to the Company \"F\" office afterwards.<ref name=casteel>[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/to%20casteel%20090999.pdf Interoffice Memorandum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220054042/https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/to%20casteel%20090999.pdf |date=February 20, 2011 }} Memo to Bruce Casteel, Chief, Texas Rangers, from Earl R.

On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians. The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Branch Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms. The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians pursuant to a plea bargain.\n\nAfter a jury trial lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the Branch Davidians on all charges. Additionally, the jury acquitted all of the Branch Davidians on the murder-related charges but convicted five of them on lesser charges, including aiding and abetting the [[voluntary manslaughter]] of federal agents.<ref>p. 7403 of the trial transcripts.</ref> Eight Branch Davidians were convicted on firearms charges.\n\nThe convicted Branch Davidians, who received sentences of up to 40 years,<ref name=\"The Sunday Times December 14, 2008\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115153/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5324263.ece 'The British Waco survivors']- The Sunday Times December 14, 2008.</ref> were:\n* Kevin A.

They raised a host of issues, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibition on possession of machine guns, the jury instructions, the district court's conduct of the trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentences imposed. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] vacated the defendants' sentences for use of machine guns, determining that the district court had made no finding that they had \"actively employed\" the weapons, but left the verdicts undisturbed in all other respects, in United States v. Branch,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100517062433/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/91/91.F3d.699.94-50437.html United States v.

Twenty-four of them were among the 80 Branch Davidian fatalities (in the raid of February 28 and the assault of April 19), including at least one child.<ref name=\"lost\" /> Two more British nationals who survived the siege were immediately arrested as \"material witnesses\" and imprisoned without trial for months.<ref name=\"The Sunday Times December 14, 2008\" /> Derek Lovelock was held in [[McLennan County, Texas|McLennan County]] Jail for seven months, often in [[solitary confinement]].<ref name=\"The Sunday Times December 14, 2008\" /> Livingstone Fagan, another British citizen, who was among those convicted and imprisoned, says he received multiple beatings at the hands of correctional officers, particularly at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth]]. There, Fagan claims to have been doused inside his cell with cold water from a high-pressure hose, after which an industrial fan was placed outside the cell, blasting him with cold air. Fagan was repeatedly moved between at least nine different facilities. He was strip-searched every time he took exercise, so he refused exercise. Released and deported back to the UK in July 2007, he still held on to his religious beliefs.<ref name=\"The Sunday Times December 14, 2008\" />\n\n=== Civil suits by Branch Davidians ===\nSeveral of the surviving Branch Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the United States government, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas [[Ann Richards]], and members of the [[Texas Army National Guard]]. They sought monetary damages under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]], civil rights statutes, the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]], and Texas state law. The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them.\n\nThe court, after a month-long trial, rejected the Branch Davidians' case. The court found that, on February 28, 1993, the Branch Davidians initiated a gun battle when they fired at federal officers who were attempting to serve lawful warrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1210879.html|title=United States vs. Branch|date=August 2, 1996|publisher=|via=caselaw.findlaw.com|access-date=June 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328111753/http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1210879.html|archive-date=March 28, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ATF agents returned gunfire to the building, the court ruled, in order to protect themselves and other agents from death or serious bodily harm. The court found that the government's planning of the siege\u2014i.e., the decisions to use tear gas against the Branch Davidians; to insert the tear gas by means of military vehicles; and to omit specific planning for the possibility that a fire would erupt\u2014was a discretionary function for which the government could not be sued. The court also found that the use of tear gas was not negligent. Further, even if the United States government were negligent by causing damage to the buildings before the fires broke out, thus either blocking escape routes or enabling the fires to spread faster, that negligence did not legally cause the plaintiffs' injuries because the Branch Davidians started the fires.\n\nThe Branch Davidians appealed. Their contention was that the trial court judge, Walter S. Smith, Jr., should have recused himself from hearing their claims on account of his relationships with defendants, defense counsel, and court staff; prior judicial determinations; and comments during trial. The Fifth Circuit concluded that these allegations did not reflect conduct that would cause a reasonable observer to question Judge Smith's impartiality, and it affirmed the take-nothing judgment, in Andrade v.

DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact. The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost. The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds. Texas Trooper Sgt.

They made an audiotape which was played for Koresh, and seemed to convince him. However, the FBI waited only three days before beginning the assault, instead of an estimated two weeks for Koresh to complete a manuscript sparked by this alternative interpretation, and then come out peacefully.<ref name=\"MessiahComplex\">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/03/31/140331fa_fact_gladwell|title=Sacred and Profane|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|date=March 31, 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=March 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328125549/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/03/31/140331fa_fact_gladwell|archive-date=March 28, 2014|url-status=live|location=New York|df=mdy-all}}</ref> An article by Stuart A. Wright published in ''Nova Religio'' discussed how the FBI mishandled the siege, stating that \"there is no greater example of misfeasance than the failure of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to bring about a bloodless resolution to the 51-day standoff.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|last=Wright |first=Stuart A. |title=A Decade After Waco: Reassessing Crisis Negotiations at Mount Carmel in Light of New Government Disclosures |publisher=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, Vol. 7, No. 2 |date=October 2003 }}</ref> Some of Wright's major concerns about the operation include that the FBI officials, especially Dick Rogers, behaved increasingly aggressively and impatiently, when the conflict could have been resolved by more peaceful negotiation. He mentions that Rogers said in an interview with the FBI that \"when we started depriving them, [we were] really driving people closer to him [Koresh] because of their devotion to him,\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> which was different from what he said in the Department of Justice report.\n\nCritics suggest that, during the final raid, the CS gas was injected into the building by armored vehicles in an unsafe manner, which could have started a fire. While two of the three fires were started well inside the building, away from where the CS gas was pumped in, survivor David Thibodeau claimed in a 1999 interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that damage to the building allowed the gas to spread, stating, \"They started to break the walls, break the windows down, spread the CS gas out.\" Further controversy involves the use of gas grenades. Attorney General Reno had specifically directed that no pyrotechnic devices be used in the assault. Between 1993 and 1999, FBI spokesmen denied (even under oath) the use of any sort of pyrotechnic devices during the assault; however, pyrotechnic Flite-Rite CS gas grenades had been found in the rubble immediately following the fire. In 1999, FBI spokesmen were forced to admit that they had used the grenades; however, they claimed that these devices\u2014which dispense CS gas through an internal burning process\u2014had been used during an early morning attempt to penetrate a covered, water-filled construction pit 40 yards (35 m) away and were not fired into the building.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> According to FBI claims, the fires started approximately three hours after the grenades had been fired. When the FBI's documents were turned over to Congress for an investigation in 1994, the page listing the use of the pyrotechnic devices was missing. The failure for six years to disclose the use of pyrotechnics despite her specific directive led Reno to demand an investigation. A senior FBI official told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that as many as 100 FBI agents had known about the use of pyrotechnics, but no one spoke up until 1999.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> On May 12, less than a month after the incident, Texas state authorities bulldozed the site, rendering further gathering of forensic evidence impossible.\n\nThe FBI had planted surveillance devices in the walls of the building, which captured a number of conversations which the government claims are evidence that the Davidians started the fire.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} The recordings were imperfect and many times difficult to understand, and the two transcriptions that were made had differences at many points.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} According to reporter Diana Fuentes, when the FBI's April 19 tapes were played in court during the Branch Davidian trials, few people heard what the FBI audio expert claimed to hear; the tapes \"were filled with noise, and voices only occasionally were discernible. ...

During a 1999 deposition for civil suits by Branch Davidian survivors, fire survivor Graeme Craddock was interviewed. He stated that he saw some Branch Davidians moving about a dozen one gallon (3.8 L) cans of fuel so they would not be run over by armored vehicles, heard talk of pouring fuel outside the building, and, after the fire had started, something that sounded like \"light the fire\" from another individual.<ref>[[s: Graeme Craddock Testimony on Waco Fire]], October 1999 civil suit deposition regarding April 19, 1993 fire at Branch Davidian home and church.</ref> Professor Kenneth Newport's book ''The Branch Davidians of Waco'' attempts to prove that starting the fire themselves was pre-planned and consistent with the Branch Davidians' theology. He cites as evidence conversations the FBI recorded during the siege, testimonials of survivors Clive Doyle and Graeme Craddock, and the buying of [[diesel fuel]] one month before the start of the siege.<ref name=\"newport\" />\n\nThe FBI received contradictory reports on the possibility of Koresh's suicide and was not sure about whether he would commit suicide. The evidence made them believe that there was no possibility of mass suicide, with Koresh and Schneider repeatedly denying to the negotiators that they had plans to commit mass suicide, and people leaving the compound saying that they had seen no preparations for such a thing.<ref name=\"deputy_suicide\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Attitudes_of_Koresh_and_others_in_the_Compound|title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas/Attitudes of Koresh and others in the Compound|author=FBI|accessdate=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615051500/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Attitudes_of_Koresh_and_others_in_the_Compound|archive-date=June 15, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=FBI}}</ref> There was a possibility that some of his followers would follow Koresh if he committed suicide.<ref name=\"deputy_suicide\" /> According to Alan A. Stone's report, during the siege the FBI used an incorrect psychiatric perspective to evaluate Branch Davidians' responses, which caused them to over-rely on Koresh's statements that they would not commit suicide. According to Stone, this incorrect evaluation caused the FBI to not ask pertinent questions to Koresh and to others on the compound about whether they were planning a mass suicide. A more pertinent question would have been, \"What will you do if we tighten the noose around the compound in a show of overwhelming power, and using CS gas, force you to come out?\"<ref name=\"stone_report\" /> Stone wrote: <blockquote>The tactical arm of federal law enforcement may conventionally think of the other side as a band of criminals or as a military force or, generically, as the aggressor. But the Branch Davidians were an unconventional group in an exalted, disturbed, and desperate state of mind. They were devoted to David Koresh as the [[Lamb of God]]. They were willing to die defending themselves in an apocalyptic ending and, in the alternative, to kill themselves and their children. However, these were neither psychiatrically depressed, suicidal people nor cold-blooded killers. They were ready to risk death as a test of their faith. The psychology of such behavior\u2014together with its religious significance for the Branch Davidians\u2014was mistakenly evaluated, if not simply ignored, by those responsible for the FBI strategy of \"tightening the noose\". The overwhelming show of force was not working in the way the tacticians supposed. It did not provoke the Branch Davidians to surrender, but it may have provoked David Koresh to order the mass-suicide.<ref name=\"stone_report\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Danforth Report ===\nThe [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995 caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government's actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Mass-mediated terrorism: the central role of the media in terrorism and counterterrorism |author= Brigitte Lebens Nacos |edition= illustrated |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 168\u2013169] |isbn= 978-0-7425-1083-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 }}</ref> By 1999\u2014as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed [[#Media portrayals|below]], as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation\u2014public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.\n\nIn September 1999, Attorney General Reno appointed former U.S. Senator [[John C. Danforth]] as [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] to investigate the matter. In particular, the Special Counsel was directed to investigate charges that government agents started or spread the fire at the Mount Carmel complex, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians, and unlawfully employed the armed forces of the United States. A yearlong investigation ensued, during which the Office of the Special Counsel interviewed 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. In the \"[[s:Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas|Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas]]\" of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found, however, that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the Branch Davidians the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel's investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against those individuals.\n\nAllegations that the government started the fire were based largely on an FBI agent's having fired three \"pyrotechnic\" tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that the rounds did not start or contribute to the spread of the fire, based on the finding that the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, {{convert|75|ft|m}} away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex. The Special Counsel noted, by contrast, that recorded interceptions of Branch Davidian conversations included such statements as \"David said we have to get the fuel on\" and \"So we light it first when they come in with the tank right ... right as they're coming in.\" Some Branch Davidians who survived the fire acknowledged that other Branch Davidians started the fire. FBI agents witnessed Branch Davidians pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of Branch Davidians, and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the Branch Davidians.\n\nCharges that government agents fired shots into the complex on April 19, 1993, were based on [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) video recorded by the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Night Stalkers]] aircraft. These tapes showed 57 flashes, with some occurring around government vehicles that were operating near the complex. The Office of Special Counsel conducted a field test of FLIR technology on March 19, 2000, to determine whether gunfire caused the flashes. The testing was conducted under a protocol agreed to and signed by attorneys and experts for the Branch Davidians and their families, as well as for the government. Analysis of the shape, duration, and location of the flashes indicated that they resulted from a reflection off debris on or around the complex, rather than gunfire. Additionally, independent expert review of photography taken at the scene showed no people at or near the points from which the flashes emanated. Interviews of Branch Davidians, government witnesses, filmmakers, writers, and advocates for the Branch Davidians found that none had witnessed any government gunfire on April 19. None of the Branch Davidians who died on that day displayed evidence of having been struck by a high velocity round, as would be expected had they been shot from outside of the complex by government sniper rifles or other assault weapons. In view of this evidence, the Special Counsel concluded that the claim that government gunfire occurred on April 19, 1993, amounted to \"an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions.\"\n\nThe Special Counsel considered whether the use of active duty military at Waco violated the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] or the Military Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. These statutes generally prohibit direct military participation in law enforcement functions but do not preclude indirect support such as lending equipment, training in the use of equipment, offering expert advice, and providing equipment maintenance. The Special Counsel noted that the military provided \"extensive\" loans of equipment to the ATF and FBI, including\u2014among other things\u2014two tanks, the offensive capability of which had been disabled. Additionally, the military provided limited advice, training, and medical support. The Special Counsel concluded that these actions amounted to indirect military assistance within the bounds of applicable law. The Texas National Guard, in its state status, also provided substantial loans of military equipment, as well as performing reconnaissance flights over the Branch Davidian complex. Because the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard in its state status, the Special Counsel determined that the National Guard lawfully provided its assistance.\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer called the Danforth report a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/7/22/91556 Koresh's Lawyer Critical of Danforth Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817034615/http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000%2F7%2F22%2F91556 |date=August 17, 2009 }}, [[United Press International|UPI]], July 22, 2000</ref> [[Ramsey Clark]]\u2014a former U.S. Attorney General, who represented several Branch Davidian survivors and relatives in a [[civil lawsuit]]\u2014said that the report \"failed to address the obvious\": \"History will clearly record, I believe, that these assaults on the Mt.

Eight years prior to the Waco fire, the ATF and FBI raided another compound of a religious cult: [[The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]. Some ATF agents who were present at that raid were present at Waco. April 19 was also the date from the [[American Revolution]]'s opening battles (\"[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the shot heard round the world]]\").\n\n=== Media portrayals ===\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books. The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, ''[[In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco]]'', which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush. The film's writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF \"propaganda\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Penningroth |first=Phil |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |title=Righting Waco: Confessions of a Hollywood Propagandist < Killing the Buddha |publisher=Killingthebuddha.com |date=2001-08-25 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103065705/http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |archive-date=January 3, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first book about the incident was 1993's ''Inside the Cult'' co-authored by ex-Branch Davidian Marc Breault, who left the group in September 1989, and Martin King who interviewed Koresh for Australian television in 1992. In July 1993, true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker published his book ''Massacre at Waco, Texas''. Shortly after, in 1994, a collection of 45 essays called ''From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco'' was published, about the events of Waco from various cultural, historical, and religious perspectives. The essays in the book include one by Michael Barkun that talked about how the Branch Davidians' behavior was consistent with other millenarian religious sects and how the use of the word cult is used to discredit religious organizations, one by James R. Lewis that claims a large amount of evidence that the FBI lit the fires, and many others. All of these perspectives are united in the belief that the deaths of the Branch Davidians at Waco could have been prevented and that \"the popular demonization of nontraditional religious movements in the aftermath of Waco represents a continuing threat to freedom of religion\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis |first=James |title=From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=1994-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe first documentary films critical of the official versions were ''[[Waco, the Big Lie]]''<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en Waco: The big lie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516114821/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en |date=May 16, 2011 }}, documentary, Google Video.</ref> and ''Waco II, the Big Lie Continues'', both produced by [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]] in 1993. Thompson's films made a number of controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|title=Bill Hicks Waco Bradley Tank Setting Fire To The Compound|last=captainwess|date=November 10, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414141019/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|archive-date=April 14, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was showing a [[flamethrower]] attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building. As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle. (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ewing| first = Phillip| author2 = Hoffman, Michael| title = Flamethrowing Tanks Gave U.S. the Edge on Iwo Jima| publisher = Marine Corps Tankers Association| date = May 30, 2009| url = http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| accessdate = April 25, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000635/http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| archivedate = June 14, 2010| df = mdy-all}}</ref>). McNulty accused Thompson of \"creative editing\" in his film ''Waco: An Apparent Deviation''. Thompson worked from a VHS copy of the surveillance tape; McNulty was given access to a beta original.

Radio host and conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] made his own documentary film, ''America Wake Up (Or Waco)'', in 2000.\n\nIn 1997, filmmakers Dan Gifford and Amy Sommer produced their [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary film, ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'',<ref name=\"rulesof\" /> presenting a history of the Branch Davidian movement and a critical examination of the conduct of law enforcement, both leading up to the raid and through the aftermath of the fire. The film features footage of the Congressional hearings on Waco, and the juxtaposition of official government spokespeople with footage and evidence often directly contradicting the spokespeople. In the documentary, Dr. Edward Allard (who held patents on FLIR technology) maintained that flashes on the FBI's infra-red footage were consistent with grenade launcher and automatic small arms fire from FBI positions at the back of the complex toward the locations which would have been exits for Branch Davidians attempting to flee the fire. ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement'' was nominated for a 1997 [[Academy Award]] for best documentary and was followed by another film in 1999, ''Waco: A New Revelation''.<ref>[http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ Waco: a new revelation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426135551/http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ |date=April 26, 2006 }}, official site of the documentary.</ref> In 2001, another Michael McNulty documentary, ''The F.L.I.R. Project'', researched the aerial thermal images recorded by the FBI, and using identical FLIR equipment recreated the same results as were recorded by federal agencies April 19, 1993.

Infra-red experts continue to disagree and filmmaker Amy Sommer stands by the original conclusions presented in ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement''.\n\nThe documentary ''The Assault on Waco'' was first aired in 2006 on the [[Discovery Channel]], detailing the entire incident. A British-American documentary, ''Inside Waco'', was produced jointly by [[Channel 4]] and [[HBO]] in 2007, attempting to show what really happened inside by piecing together accounts from the parties involved.\n\nBranch Davidian survivor David Thibodeau wrote his account of life in the group and of the siege in the book ''A Place Called Waco'', published in 1999.

Suspecting the group of stockpiling illegal weapons, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF) obtained a search warrant for the compound and arrest warrants for Koresh and a select few of the group's members.\n\nThe incident began when the ATF attempted to raid the ranch. An intense gun battle erupted, resulting in the deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians. Upon the ATF's failure to raid the compound, a siege lasting 51 days was initiated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Eventually, the FBI launched an assault and initiated a [[tear gas]] attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch. During the attack, a fire engulfed Mount Carmel Center. This resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians, including 20 children, two pregnant women and David Koresh.<ref>Dick J.

In 1959, Victor's widow, Florence Houteff, announced that the expected [[Armageddon]] was about to take place, and members were told to gather at the center to await this event. Many built houses, others stayed in tents, trucks, or buses, and most sold their possessions.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\"/>\n\nFollowing the failure of this prophecy, control of the site ([[Mount Carmel Center]]) fell to [[Benjamin Roden]], founder of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association (Branch Davidians). He promoted different doctrinal beliefs than Victor Houteff's original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization. On Roden's death, control fell to his wife, [[Lois Roden]]. Lois considered their son, [[George Roden]], unfit to assume the position of [[prophet]]. Instead, she groomed Vernon Howell (later known as [[David Koresh]]) as her chosen successor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1984, a meeting led to a division of the group, with Howell leading one faction (calling themselves the Branch Davidians) and George Roden leading the competing faction.

This store, named the \"Mag-Bag\", had been identified by said postal worker as suspicious in deliveries. The postal worker continued deliveries to the Mt. Carmel Center and reported seeing manned observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed they were armed personnel at these observations posts.\n\nThe McClennan county sheriff was notified in May and June of that year of two cases of inert grenades, black gunpowder, 90 pounds of powdered aluminum metal, and 30-40 cardboard tubes. Furthermore, the sheriff noticed another shipment of sixty AR-15/M-16 magazines, to which Davy Aguilera made the statement, \"I have been involved in many cases where defendants, following a relatively simple process, convert AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to fully automatic rifles of the nature of the M-16\" to justify the ATF's involvement in the case.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother report was made to the Sheriff in November of 1992 by a local farmer who believed he heard machine gun fire. \"By the sound of it,\" he said, \"it was likely a .50 caliber machine gun and multiple M-16's.\" This farmer claimed he was very familiar with machine guns, having done a tour overseas in the U.S Army.\nThe affidavit closes with Aguilera verifying the story via interviews made with associated parties and gun shops from which the Mag-Bag purchased items. Among these items were over forty-five AR-15 upper receivers and five M-16 upper receivers, which Aguilera clearly annotates, \"These kits contain all the parts of an M-16 machine gun except for the lower receiver unit which is the \"firearm\" by lawful definition,\" admitting that neither the noise complaints nor the items ordered were necessarily illegal. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nDepartment of Human Services is noted in the affidavit as well. BATF happened to get statements from a department worker who managed to investigate a case on the Carmel site.  This agent, Joyce Sparks, had two separate visits to the grounds where she questioned members of the Branch Davidians and toured the compound. The first visit involved interviewing a young boy of the compound \"who was in a rush to grow up so he can have a long gun.\" This issue was not looked into until Ms. Joyce's second visit, when she was able to speak to David Koresh himself. He nonchalantly mentioned there were only a few guns, but when Ms. Joyce asked if it is okay to tour the compound, he requested she wait for thirty minutes so he can hide any guns from members not shown the guns. During this tour was when Ms. Joyce looked inside a trap door and noticed a buried bus with a refrigerator at the end. It was obvious to Ms. Joyce that the refrigerator was used as target practice by the Davidians, with the bullet holes in it and the guns strewn along the floor of this makeshift basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== ATF raid ==\n=== Preparations ===\n[[File:Branch Davidian Compound Near Waco.jpg|thumb|The Branch Davidian compound as photographed during the ensuing siege]]\n\nUsing the [[affidavit]] filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated [[Law of the United States|federal law]], the ATF obtained search and [[arrest warrant]]s for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated.<ref>Search Warrant W93-15M for the \"residence of Vernon Wayne Howell, and others\", signed by U.S. Judge or Magistrate Dennis G.

One agent was killed and another wounded. The third agent scampered over the peak of the roof and joined other agents attempting to enter the arms room. The window was smashed, a flashbang [[stun grenade]] was thrown in, and three agents entered the arms room. When another tried to follow them, a hail of bullets penetrated the wall and wounded him, but he was able to reach a ladder and slide to safety. An agent fired with his shotgun at Branch Davidians until he was hit in the head by return fire and killed.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/> Inside the arms room, the agents killed a Branch Davidian and discovered a cache of weapons but then came under heavy fire; two were wounded. As they escaped, the third agent laid down covering fire, killing a Branch Davidian. As he made his escape, he hit his head on a wooden support beam and fell off the roof but survived. An agent outside provided them with covering fire but was shot by a Branch Davidian and killed instantly. Dozens of ATF agents took cover, many behind Branch Davidian vehicles, and exchanged fire with the Branch Davidians. The number of ATF wounded increased, and an agent was killed by gunfire from the compound as agents were firing at a Branch Davidian perched on top of the water tower. The exchange of fire continued, but 45 minutes into the raid the gunfire began to slow down as agents began to run low on ammunition. The shooting continued for two hours.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nSheriff Lt.

The Davidians, however, had plenty.\" In all, four ATF agents (Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway Charles LeBleu) had been killed during the firefight. Another 16 had been injured. After the ceasefire, the Branch Davidians allowed the ATF dead and wounded to be evacuated and held their fire during the ATF retreat.\n\nThe five Branch Davidians killed in the raid were Winston Blake, Peter Gent, Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones, and Jaydean Wendell; two were killed at the hands of the Branch Davidians after having been wounded.<ref>Coulson, Danny O & Shannon, Elaine, ''No Heroes'' {{ISBN|0-671-02062-5}}</ref> Their bodies were buried on the grounds.

The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing [[Jeff Jamar]], head of the Bureau's [[San Antonio]] [[List of FBI field offices|field office]], in charge of the siege as Site Commander. The FBI [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the [[Ruby Ridge|Ruby Ridge incident]]. As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.\n\nAt first, the Davidians had telephone contact with local news media, and Koresh gave phone interviews. The FBI cut Davidian communication to the outside world. For the next 51 days, communication with those inside was by telephone by a group of 25 FBI negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The final [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report found that negotiators criticized the tactical commanders for undercutting negotiations.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit Report of the Department of the Treasury on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Investigation of Vernon Wayne Howell also known as David Koresh, September, 1993] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042646/https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit |date=April 2, 2016 }}, Appendix D, 136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nIn the first few days, the FBI believed they had made a breakthrough when they negotiated with Koresh an agreement that the Branch Davidians would peacefully leave the compound in return for a message, recorded by Koresh, being broadcast on national radio.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The broadcast was made, but Koresh then told negotiators that God had told him to remain in the building and \"wait\".<ref name=\"iw\" /> Despite this, soon afterwards negotiators managed to facilitate the release of 19 children, ranging in age from five months to 12 years old, without their parents.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> However, 98 people remained in the building.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children were then interviewed by the FBI and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], some for hours at a time.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the standoff.<ref name=\"child_abuse\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas/Child Abuse|author=FBI|accessdate=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817102810/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|archive-date=August 17, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=FBI}}</ref> This was the key justification offered by the FBI (both to President [[Bill Clinton]] and to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]]) for launching [[tear gas]] attacks to force the Branch Davidians out of the compound.<ref name=\"lost\">{{Cite news | work = The Guardian | title = Lost in America | author = Nick Davies | date = January 14, 1994 | url = http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | access-date = March 19, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042258/http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | archive-date = March 4, 2016 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all | author-link = Nick Davies }}</ref>\n\nDuring the siege, the FBI sent a video camera to the Branch Davidians.

Increasingly aggressive techniques were used to try to force the Branch Davidians out. For instance, [[sleep deprivation]] of the inhabitants by means of all-night broadcasts of recordings of jet planes, pop music, chanting, and the screams of rabbits being slaughtered. Outside the compound, nine [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s carrying [[United States 40&nbsp;mm grenades#Less Lethal and Riot Control Cartridges|M651 CS tear gas grenades]] and [[Riot gun#Ferret rounds|Ferret rounds]] and five [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]]s obtained from the [[U.S. Army]] began patrolling.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The armored vehicles were used to destroy perimeter fencing and outbuildings and crush cars belonging to the Branch Davidians. Armored vehicles repeatedly drove over the grave of Branch Davidian Peter Gent despite protests by the Branch Davidians and the negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nTwo of the three water storage tanks on the roof of the main building had been damaged during the initial ATF raid. Eventually the FBI cut all power and water to the compound, forcing those inside to survive on rain water and stockpiled military [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] rations.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Criticism was later leveled by Schneider's attorney, Jack Zimmerman, at the tactic of using sleep-and-peace-disrupting sound against the Branch Davidians: \"The point was this \u2013 they were trying to have sleep disturbance and they were trying to take someone that they viewed as unstable to start with, and they were trying to drive him crazy. And then they got mad 'cos he does something that they think is irrational!\"<ref>Testimony to the Subcommittee on National Security ''et al.'', loc cite. Congressional Record, July 1995.</ref>\n\nDespite the increasingly aggressive tactics, Koresh ordered a group of followers to leave. Eleven people left and were arrested as material witnesses, with one person charged with [[conspiracy to murder]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children's willingness to stay with Koresh disturbed the negotiators, who were unprepared to work around the Branch Davidians' religious zeal. However, as the siege went on, the children were aware that an earlier group of children who had left with some women were immediately separated, and the women arrested.\n\nDuring the siege, a number of scholars who study [[apocalypticism]] in religious groups attempted to persuade the FBI that the siege tactics being used by government agents would only reinforce the impression within the Branch Davidians that they were part of a Biblical \"[[End time|end-of-times]]\" confrontation that had cosmic significance.<ref name=\"usatodayreligion\">{{Cite news | title = U.S. ignores religion's fringes | work = USA Today | date = October 4, 2001 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | accessdate = May 27, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614235202/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | archive-date = June 14, 2010 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> This would likely increase the chances of a violent and deadly outcome.

Recalling the April 19, 1985, [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (CSAL) siege in [[Arkansas]] (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), President Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians. Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSAL; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent. Clinton later recounted: \"Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.\"<ref>Bill Clinton, ''My Life'', Alfred A.

Because the Branch Davidians were heavily armed, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's arms included [[.50 caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV). The CEVs used explosives to punch holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in [[CS gas]] (\"tear gas\") and try to force the Branch Davidians out without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Officially, no armed assault was to be made. Loudspeakers were to be used to tell the Branch Davidians that there would be no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. According to the FBI, the Hostage Rescue Team agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19. When several Branch Davidians opened fire, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's response was only to increase the amount of gas being used.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nThe FBI Hostage Rescue Team delivered {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} CS grenade fire from [[M79 grenade launcher]]s. Very early in the morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team fired two military M651 rounds at the Branch Davidian construction site. Around mid-morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team began to run low on 40&nbsp;mm Ferret CS rounds and asked Texas Ranger Captain David Byrnes for tear gas rounds. The tear gas rounds procured from Company \"F\" in Waco turned out to be unusable pyrotechnic rounds and were returned to the Company \"F\" office afterwards.<ref name=casteel>[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/to%20casteel%20090999.pdf Interoffice Memorandum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220054042/https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/to%20casteel%20090999.pdf |date=February 20, 2011 }} Memo to Bruce Casteel, Chief, Texas Rangers, from Earl R.

The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians pursuant to a plea bargain.\n\nAfter a jury trial lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the Branch Davidians on all charges.

They raised a host of issues, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibition on possession of machine guns, the jury instructions, the district court's conduct of the trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentences imposed. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] vacated the defendants' sentences for use of machine guns, determining that the district court had made no finding that they had \"actively employed\" the weapons, but left the verdicts undisturbed in all other respects, in United States v.

The court found that the government's planning of the siege\u2014i.e., the decisions to use tear gas against the Branch Davidians; to insert the tear gas by means of military vehicles; and to omit specific planning for the possibility that a fire would erupt\u2014was a discretionary function for which the government could not be sued. The court also found that the use of tear gas was not negligent. Further, even if the United States government were negligent by causing damage to the buildings before the fires broke out, thus either blocking escape routes or enabling the fires to spread faster, that negligence did not legally cause the plaintiffs' injuries because the Branch Davidians started the fires.\n\nThe Branch Davidians appealed. Their contention was that the trial court judge, Walter S. Smith, Jr., should have recused himself from hearing their claims on account of his relationships with defendants, defense counsel, and court staff; prior judicial determinations; and comments during trial. The Fifth Circuit concluded that these allegations did not reflect conduct that would cause a reasonable observer to question Judge Smith's impartiality, and it affirmed the take-nothing judgment, in Andrade v.

He mentions that Rogers said in an interview with the FBI that \"when we started depriving them, [we were] really driving people closer to him [Koresh] because of their devotion to him,\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> which was different from what he said in the Department of Justice report.\n\nCritics suggest that, during the final raid, the CS gas was injected into the building by armored vehicles in an unsafe manner, which could have started a fire. While two of the three fires were started well inside the building, away from where the CS gas was pumped in, survivor David Thibodeau claimed in a 1999 interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that damage to the building allowed the gas to spread, stating, \"They started to break the walls, break the windows down, spread the CS gas out.\" Further controversy involves the use of gas grenades. Attorney General Reno had specifically directed that no pyrotechnic devices be used in the assault. Between 1993 and 1999, FBI spokesmen denied (even under oath) the use of any sort of pyrotechnic devices during the assault; however, pyrotechnic Flite-Rite CS gas grenades had been found in the rubble immediately following the fire. In 1999, FBI spokesmen were forced to admit that they had used the grenades; however, they claimed that these devices\u2014which dispense CS gas through an internal burning process\u2014had been used during an early morning attempt to penetrate a covered, water-filled construction pit 40 yards (35 m) away and were not fired into the building.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> According to FBI claims, the fires started approximately three hours after the grenades had been fired. When the FBI's documents were turned over to Congress for an investigation in 1994, the page listing the use of the pyrotechnic devices was missing. The failure for six years to disclose the use of pyrotechnics despite her specific directive led Reno to demand an investigation. A senior FBI official told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that as many as 100 FBI agents had known about the use of pyrotechnics, but no one spoke up until 1999.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> On May 12, less than a month after the incident, Texas state authorities bulldozed the site, rendering further gathering of forensic evidence impossible.\n\nThe FBI had planted surveillance devices in the walls of the building, which captured a number of conversations which the government claims are evidence that the Davidians started the fire.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} The recordings were imperfect and many times difficult to understand, and the two transcriptions that were made had differences at many points.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} According to reporter Diana Fuentes, when the FBI's April 19 tapes were played in court during the Branch Davidian trials, few people heard what the FBI audio expert claimed to hear; the tapes \"were filled with noise, and voices only occasionally were discernible. ...

During a 1999 deposition for civil suits by Branch Davidian survivors, fire survivor Graeme Craddock was interviewed. He stated that he saw some Branch Davidians moving about a dozen one gallon (3.8 L) cans of fuel so they would not be run over by armored vehicles, heard talk of pouring fuel outside the building, and, after the fire had started, something that sounded like \"light the fire\" from another individual.<ref>[[s: Graeme Craddock Testimony on Waco Fire]], October 1999 civil suit deposition regarding April 19, 1993 fire at Branch Davidian home and church.</ref> Professor Kenneth Newport's book ''The Branch Davidians of Waco'' attempts to prove that starting the fire themselves was pre-planned and consistent with the Branch Davidians' theology.

Stone's report, during the siege the FBI used an incorrect psychiatric perspective to evaluate Branch Davidians' responses, which caused them to over-rely on Koresh's statements that they would not commit suicide. According to Stone, this incorrect evaluation caused the FBI to not ask pertinent questions to Koresh and to others on the compound about whether they were planning a mass suicide. A more pertinent question would have been, \"What will you do if we tighten the noose around the compound in a show of overwhelming power, and using CS gas, force you to come out?\"<ref name=\"stone_report\" /> Stone wrote: <blockquote>The tactical arm of federal law enforcement may conventionally think of the other side as a band of criminals or as a military force or, generically, as the aggressor. But the Branch Davidians were an unconventional group in an exalted, disturbed, and desperate state of mind. They were devoted to David Koresh as the [[Lamb of God]]. They were willing to die defending themselves in an apocalyptic ending and, in the alternative, to kill themselves and their children. However, these were neither psychiatrically depressed, suicidal people nor cold-blooded killers. They were ready to risk death as a test of their faith. The psychology of such behavior\u2014together with its religious significance for the Branch Davidians\u2014was mistakenly evaluated, if not simply ignored, by those responsible for the FBI strategy of \"tightening the noose\". The overwhelming show of force was not working in the way the tacticians supposed. It did not provoke the Branch Davidians to surrender, but it may have provoked David Koresh to order the mass-suicide.<ref name=\"stone_report\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Danforth Report ===\nThe [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995 caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government's actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Mass-mediated terrorism: the central role of the media in terrorism and counterterrorism |author= Brigitte Lebens Nacos |edition= illustrated |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 168\u2013169] |isbn= 978-0-7425-1083-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 }}</ref> By 1999\u2014as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed [[#Media portrayals|below]], as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation\u2014public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.\n\nIn September 1999, Attorney General Reno appointed former U.S. Senator [[John C. Danforth]] as [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] to investigate the matter. In particular, the Special Counsel was directed to investigate charges that government agents started or spread the fire at the Mount Carmel complex, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians, and unlawfully employed the armed forces of the United States. A yearlong investigation ensued, during which the Office of the Special Counsel interviewed 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. In the \"[[s:Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas|Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas]]\" of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found, however, that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the Branch Davidians the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel's investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against those individuals.\n\nAllegations that the government started the fire were based largely on an FBI agent's having fired three \"pyrotechnic\" tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that the rounds did not start or contribute to the spread of the fire, based on the finding that the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, {{convert|75|ft|m}} away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex. The Special Counsel noted, by contrast, that recorded interceptions of Branch Davidian conversations included such statements as \"David said we have to get the fuel on\" and \"So we light it first when they come in with the tank right ... right as they're coming in.\" Some Branch Davidians who survived the fire acknowledged that other Branch Davidians started the fire. FBI agents witnessed Branch Davidians pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of Branch Davidians, and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the Branch Davidians.\n\nCharges that government agents fired shots into the complex on April 19, 1993, were based on [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) video recorded by the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Night Stalkers]] aircraft. These tapes showed 57 flashes, with some occurring around government vehicles that were operating near the complex. The Office of Special Counsel conducted a field test of FLIR technology on March 19, 2000, to determine whether gunfire caused the flashes. The testing was conducted under a protocol agreed to and signed by attorneys and experts for the Branch Davidians and their families, as well as for the government. Analysis of the shape, duration, and location of the flashes indicated that they resulted from a reflection off debris on or around the complex, rather than gunfire. Additionally, independent expert review of photography taken at the scene showed no people at or near the points from which the flashes emanated. Interviews of Branch Davidians, government witnesses, filmmakers, writers, and advocates for the Branch Davidians found that none had witnessed any government gunfire on April 19. None of the Branch Davidians who died on that day displayed evidence of having been struck by a high velocity round, as would be expected had they been shot from outside of the complex by government sniper rifles or other assault weapons. In view of this evidence, the Special Counsel concluded that the claim that government gunfire occurred on April 19, 1993, amounted to \"an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions.\"\n\nThe Special Counsel considered whether the use of active duty military at Waco violated the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] or the Military Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. These statutes generally prohibit direct military participation in law enforcement functions but do not preclude indirect support such as lending equipment, training in the use of equipment, offering expert advice, and providing equipment maintenance. The Special Counsel noted that the military provided \"extensive\" loans of equipment to the ATF and FBI, including\u2014among other things\u2014two tanks, the offensive capability of which had been disabled. Additionally, the military provided limited advice, training, and medical support. The Special Counsel concluded that these actions amounted to indirect military assistance within the bounds of applicable law. The Texas National Guard, in its state status, also provided substantial loans of military equipment, as well as performing reconnaissance flights over the Branch Davidian complex. Because the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard in its state status, the Special Counsel determined that the National Guard lawfully provided its assistance.\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer called the Danforth report a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/7/22/91556 Koresh's Lawyer Critical of Danforth Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817034615/http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000%2F7%2F22%2F91556 |date=August 17, 2009 }}, [[United Press International|UPI]], July 22, 2000</ref> [[Ramsey Clark]]\u2014a former U.S. Attorney General, who represented several Branch Davidian survivors and relatives in a [[civil lawsuit]]\u2014said that the report \"failed to address the obvious\": \"History will clearly record, I believe, that these assaults on the Mt.

Eight years prior to the Waco fire, the ATF and FBI raided another compound of a religious cult: [[The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]. Some ATF agents who were present at that raid were present at Waco. April 19 was also the date from the [[American Revolution]]'s opening battles (\"[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the shot heard round the world]]\").\n\n=== Media portrayals ===\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books. The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, ''[[In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco]]'', which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush. The film's writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF \"propaganda\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Penningroth |first=Phil |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |title=Righting Waco: Confessions of a Hollywood Propagandist < Killing the Buddha |publisher=Killingthebuddha.com |date=2001-08-25 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103065705/http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |archive-date=January 3, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first book about the incident was 1993's ''Inside the Cult'' co-authored by ex-Branch Davidian Marc Breault, who left the group in September 1989, and Martin King who interviewed Koresh for Australian television in 1992. In July 1993, true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker published his book ''Massacre at Waco, Texas''. Shortly after, in 1994, a collection of 45 essays called ''From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco'' was published, about the events of Waco from various cultural, historical, and religious perspectives. The essays in the book include one by Michael Barkun that talked about how the Branch Davidians' behavior was consistent with other millenarian religious sects and how the use of the word cult is used to discredit religious organizations, one by James R. Lewis that claims a large amount of evidence that the FBI lit the fires, and many others. All of these perspectives are united in the belief that the deaths of the Branch Davidians at Waco could have been prevented and that \"the popular demonization of nontraditional religious movements in the aftermath of Waco represents a continuing threat to freedom of religion\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis |first=James |title=From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=1994-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe first documentary films critical of the official versions were ''[[Waco, the Big Lie]]''<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en Waco: The big lie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516114821/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en |date=May 16, 2011 }}, documentary, Google Video.</ref> and ''Waco II, the Big Lie Continues'', both produced by [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]] in 1993. Thompson's films made a number of controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|title=Bill Hicks Waco Bradley Tank Setting Fire To The Compound|last=captainwess|date=November 10, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414141019/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|archive-date=April 14, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was showing a [[flamethrower]] attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building. As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle. (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ewing| first = Phillip| author2 = Hoffman, Michael| title = Flamethrowing Tanks Gave U.S. the Edge on Iwo Jima| publisher = Marine Corps Tankers Association| date = May 30, 2009| url = http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| accessdate = April 25, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000635/http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| archivedate = June 14, 2010| df = mdy-all}}</ref>).

Radio host and conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] made his own documentary film, ''America Wake Up (Or Waco)'', in 2000.\n\nIn 1997, filmmakers Dan Gifford and Amy Sommer produced their [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary film, ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'',<ref name=\"rulesof\" /> presenting a history of the Branch Davidian movement and a critical examination of the conduct of law enforcement, both leading up to the raid and through the aftermath of the fire. The film features footage of the Congressional hearings on Waco, and the juxtaposition of official government spokespeople with footage and evidence often directly contradicting the spokespeople. In the documentary, Dr. Edward Allard (who held patents on FLIR technology) maintained that flashes on the FBI's infra-red footage were consistent with grenade launcher and automatic small arms fire from FBI positions at the back of the complex toward the locations which would have been exits for Branch Davidians attempting to flee the fire. ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement'' was nominated for a 1997 [[Academy Award]] for best documentary and was followed by another film in 1999, ''Waco: A New Revelation''.<ref>[http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ Waco: a new revelation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426135551/http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ |date=April 26, 2006 }}, official site of the documentary.</ref> In 2001, another Michael McNulty documentary, ''The F.L.I.R.

Infra-red experts continue to disagree and filmmaker Amy Sommer stands by the original conclusions presented in ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement''.\n\nThe documentary ''The Assault on Waco'' was first aired in 2006 on the [[Discovery Channel]], detailing the entire incident.

The plants have two linear [[leaves]] and a single small white drooping bell shaped [[flower]] with six petal-like ([[petaloid]]) [[tepals]] in two circles ([[whorl (botany)|whorls]]). The smaller inner petals have green markings.\n\nSnowdrops have been known since the earliest times under various names, but were named ''Galanthus'' in 1753. As the number of recognised species increased, various attempts were made to divide the species into subgroups, usually on the basis of the pattern of the emerging leaves ([[vernation]]). In the era of [[molecular phylogenetics]] this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven molecularly-defined [[clades]] are recognised corresponding to the [[biogeographical]] distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.\n\nMost species flower in winter, before the [[vernal equinox]] (20 or 21 March in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), but some flower in early [[spring (season)|spring]] and late [[autumn]]. Sometimes snowdrops are confused with the two related genera within the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Galantheae]], snowflakes ''[[Leucojum]]'' and ''[[Acis (plant)|Acis]]''.\n\n==Description==\n\n=== General ===\nAll [[species]] of ''Galanthus'' are [[perennial]] [[petaloid]] [[herbaceous]] bulbous (growing from [[bulb]]s) [[monocot]] plants. The [[genus]] is characterised by the presence of two [[leaves]], [[:wikt:pendulous|pendulous]] white [[flowers]] with six free [[perianth]] segments in two [[whorl (botany)|whorls]]. The inner whorl is smaller than the outer whorl and has green markings.{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}}\n\n=== Vegetative ===\n\n; Leaves:\nThese are basal, emerging from the bulb initially-enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of [[cataphylls]]. Generally, these are two (sometimes three) in number and linear, strap-shaped, or [[oblanceolate]]. [[Vernation]], the arrangement of the emerging leaves relative to each other, varies among species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate), or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants, one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains at the point where the leaves emerge from the soil{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;1\u20132}} (for illustration, see Stearn{{sfn|Stearn vernation|1992}} and Davis{{sfn|Davis vernation|1999}}). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids, but now has been shown to be [[homoplasious]], and not useful in this regard.\n\nThe [[Scape (botany)|scape]] (flowering stalk) is erect, leafless, [[terete]], or compressed.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n=== Reproductive ===\n\n;[[Inflorescence]] :\nThe scape bears at the top a pair of [[bract]]-like [[spathe]] valves usually fused down one side and joined by a papery membrane, appearing [[Glossary of botanical terms#monophyllous|monophyllous]] (single). From between them emerges a solitary (rarely two), pendulous, nodding, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The flower bears six free [[perianth]] segments ([[tepal]]s) rather than [[petals]], arranged in two whorls of three, the outer whorl being larger and more convex than the inner series. The outer tepals are [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|acute]] to more or less [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|obtuse]], [[spathulate]] or oblanceolate to narrowly [[obovate]] or linear, shortly clawed, and erect spreading. The inner tepals are much shorter (half to two thirds as long), oblong, spathulate or oblanceolate, somewhat [[:wikt:unguiculate|unguiculate]] (claw like) and tapered to the base and erect. These tepals also bear green markings at the base, apex, or both, that when at the apex, are bridge-shaped over the small [[Sinus (botany)|sinus]] (notch) at the tip of each tepal, which are [[emarginate]]. Occasionally the markings are either green-yellow, yellow, or absent, and the shape and size varies by species.<ref name=Meerow98/>{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Androecium]] :\nThe six [[stamens]] are inserted at the base of the perianth, and are very short (shorter than the inner perianth segments), the anthers basifixed (attached at their base) with filaments much shorter than the anthers and [[dehisce]] (open) by terminal [[stoma|pores]] or short slits.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Gynoecium]], [[Fruit]] and [[Seeds]]:\nThe inferior [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is three-celled. The [[style (botany)|style]] is slender and longer than the anthers, the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] are minutely capitate. The ovary ripens into a three-celled [[capsule (botany)|capsule]] fruit.

In doing so he restored the name ''Galanthus'' and retained their placement under Narcissi, this time as a family (known as ''Ordo'', at that time) and referred to the French vernacular name, ''[[:fr:Perce-neige|Perce-neige]]''{{sfn|Clos|1862|loc=''Perce-neige'' p.&nbsp;658}} (Snow-pierce), based on the plants tendency to push through early spring snow (see [[#Ecology|Ecology]] for illustration)].<ref name=Jussieu/> The modern family of [[Amaryllidaceae]], in which ''Galanthus'' is placed, dates to [[Jaume Saint-Hilaire]] (1805) who replaced Jussieu's Narcissi with ''Amaryllid\u00e9es''.<ref name=Saint-Hilaire/> In 1810 [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Brown]] proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the [[Ovary (botany)|ovaries]] and be referred to as Amaryllideae,<ref name=Brown/> and in 1813, [[de Candolle]] separated them by describing Liliac\u00e9es <small>Juss.</small> and Amaryllid\u00e9es <small>Brown</small> as two quite separate families.<ref name=Candolle/> However, in his comprehensive survey of the [[Flora]] [[Flora of France|of France]] ([[De Candolle system|Flore fran\u00e7aise]], 1805\u20131815) he divided Liliaceae into a series of ''Ordres'', and placed Galanthus into the Narcissi ''Ordre''.<ref name=Candollegal/> This relationship of Galanthus to either liliaceous or amaryllidaceaous taxa (see [[Taxonomy of Liliaceae]]) was to last for another two centuries until the two were formally divided at the end of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Meerow et al|1999}} [[John Lindley|Lindley]] (1830) followed this general pattern, placing ''Galanthus'' and related genera such as ''[[Amaryllis]]'' and ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' in his Amaryllideae (which he called The Narcissus Tribe in English).<ref name=Lindley1830/> By 1853, the number of known plants was increasing considerably and he revised his schema in his last work, placing ''Galanthus'' together, and the other two genera in the modern [[Galantheae]] in tribe Amarylleae, order Amaryllidaceae, alliance Narcissales.<ref name=Lindley53Amarylleae/> These three genera have been treated together taxonomically by most authors, on the basis of an inferior ovary.

''vernalis'', from Sicily, northern Greece and the southern part of former Yugoslavia, blooms at the end of the winter with developed young leaves and is thus easily confused with ''G. nivalis''.\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n''Galanthus'' is derived from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] \u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 (''gala''), meaning \"milk\" and \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (''anthos'') meaning \"flower\", alluding to the colour of the flowers. The [[epithet]] ''nivalis'' is derived from the [[Latin]], meaning \"of the snow\".{{sfn|Hyam |Pankhurst |1995}}{{sfn|Hollinger|2016}} The word \"Snowdrop\" may be derived from the [[German language|German]] ''Schneetropfen'' (Snow-drop), the tear drop shaped pearl earrings popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Other, earlier, common names include Candlemas bells, Fair maids of February, and White ladies (see [[#Symbols|Symbols]]).<ref name=Churchgal/>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Schneeglocken.jpg|thumb|''G. nivalis'' piercing snow cover]]\nSnowdrops are [[hardiness (plants)|hardy]] [[herbaceous]] plants that [[perennate]] by underground [[bulbs]]. They are among the earliest spring bulbs to bloom, although a few forms of ''G. nivalis'' are autumn flowering.<ref name=Dahlgren/>{{sfn|Harland|2016}} In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile,{{sfn|Davis|1999}} found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites.{{sfn|Harland|2016}} The leaves die back a few weeks after the flowers have faded. ''Galanthus'' plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming bulb [[offset (botany)|offset]]s. They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.{{sfn|Harland|2016}}<ref name=Churchgal/>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nSome snowdrop species are threatened in their wild [[habitats]], due to [[habitat destruction]], illegal collecting, and [[climate change]].{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}} In most countries collecting bulbs from the wild is now illegal. Under [[CITES]] regulations, international trade in any quantity of ''Galanthus'', whether bulbs, live plants, or even dead ones, is illegal without a CITES permit.{{sfn|CITES|2016}} This applies to hybrids and named cultivars, as well as species. CITES lists all species, but allows a limited trade in wild-collected bulbs of just three species (''G. nivalis'', ''G. elwesii'', and ''G. woronowii'') from Turkey and Georgia (see [[#Horticulture|Horticulture]]).<ref name=Citesexp16/>{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=pp.&nbsp;341\u2013343}} A number of species are on the [[IUCN]] [[Red List]] of threatened species, with the [[conservation status]] being ''G. trojanus'' as [[critically endangered]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/164902/5937668|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> four species [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]], ''G. nivalis'' is [[near threatened]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/162168/5551773|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> and several species show decreasing populations.{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}} ''G. panjutinii'' is considered [[endangered species|endangered]]. One of its five known sites, at Sochi, was destroyed by preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics.<ref name=RBGpanj/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n''Galanthus'' species and cultivars are extremely popular as symbols of spring and are traded more than any other wild-source ornamental bulb genus. Millions of bulbs are exported annually from Turkey and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}} For instance export quotas for 2016 for ''G. elwesii'' are 7 million for Turkey and 15 million for Georgia. Data for ''G. worononowii'' are 15 million for Georgia. These figures include both wild-taken and artificially propagated bulbs.<ref name=Citesexp16/>\n\n===Snowdrop gardens===\n[[File:Bank Hall Snowdrops Feb 2009.JPG|thumb|right|A snowdrop carpet at [[Bank Hall]], Bretherton, UK in February 2009]]\n{{main|List of snowdrop gardens}}\nCelebrated as a sign of spring, snowdrops may form impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised.

Also, many hybrids between these and other species exist (more than 500 cultivars are described in Bishop, Davis, and Grimshaw's book, plus lists of many cultivars that have now been lost, and others not seen by the authors). They differ particularly in the size, shape, and markings of the flower, the period of flowering, and other characteristics, mainly of interest to the keen (even fanatical) snowdrop collectors, known as \"[[galanthophile]]s\", who hold meetings where the scarcer cultivars change hands.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;329}} &nbsp;Double-flowered cultivars and forms, such as the extremely common ''Galanthus nivalis'' [[Form (botany)|f.]] ''pleniflorus'' 'Flore Pleno', may be less attractive to some people, but they can have greater visual impact in a garden setting.

The plants have two linear [[leaves]] and a single small white drooping bell shaped [[flower]] with six petal-like ([[petaloid]]) [[tepals]] in two circles ([[whorl (botany)|whorls]]). The smaller inner petals have green markings.\n\nSnowdrops have been known since the earliest times under various names, but were named ''Galanthus'' in 1753. As the number of recognised species increased, various attempts were made to divide the species into subgroups, usually on the basis of the pattern of the emerging leaves ([[vernation]]). In the era of [[molecular phylogenetics]] this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven molecularly-defined [[clades]] are recognised corresponding to the [[biogeographical]] distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.\n\nMost species flower in winter, before the [[vernal equinox]] (20 or 21 March in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), but some flower in early [[spring (season)|spring]] and late [[autumn]]. Sometimes snowdrops are confused with the two related genera within the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Galantheae]], snowflakes ''[[Leucojum]]'' and ''[[Acis (plant)|Acis]]''.\n\n==Description==\n\n=== General ===\nAll [[species]] of ''Galanthus'' are [[perennial]] [[petaloid]] [[herbaceous]] bulbous (growing from [[bulb]]s) [[monocot]] plants. The [[genus]] is characterised by the presence of two [[leaves]], [[:wikt:pendulous|pendulous]] white [[flowers]] with six free [[perianth]] segments in two [[whorl (botany)|whorls]]. The inner whorl is smaller than the outer whorl and has green markings.{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}}\n\n=== Vegetative ===\n\n; Leaves:\nThese are basal, emerging from the bulb initially-enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of [[cataphylls]]. Generally, these are two (sometimes three) in number and linear, strap-shaped, or [[oblanceolate]]. [[Vernation]], the arrangement of the emerging leaves relative to each other, varies among species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate), or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants, one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains at the point where the leaves emerge from the soil{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;1\u20132}} (for illustration, see Stearn{{sfn|Stearn vernation|1992}} and Davis{{sfn|Davis vernation|1999}}). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids, but now has been shown to be [[homoplasious]], and not useful in this regard.\n\nThe [[Scape (botany)|scape]] (flowering stalk) is erect, leafless, [[terete]], or compressed.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n=== Reproductive ===\n\n;[[Inflorescence]] :\nThe scape bears at the top a pair of [[bract]]-like [[spathe]] valves usually fused down one side and joined by a papery membrane, appearing [[Glossary of botanical terms#monophyllous|monophyllous]] (single). From between them emerges a solitary (rarely two), pendulous, nodding, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The flower bears six free [[perianth]] segments ([[tepal]]s) rather than [[petals]], arranged in two whorls of three, the outer whorl being larger and more convex than the inner series. The outer tepals are [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|acute]] to more or less [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|obtuse]], [[spathulate]] or oblanceolate to narrowly [[obovate]] or linear, shortly clawed, and erect spreading. The inner tepals are much shorter (half to two thirds as long), oblong, spathulate or oblanceolate, somewhat [[:wikt:unguiculate|unguiculate]] (claw like) and tapered to the base and erect. These tepals also bear green markings at the base, apex, or both, that when at the apex, are bridge-shaped over the small [[Sinus (botany)|sinus]] (notch) at the tip of each tepal, which are [[emarginate]]. Occasionally the markings are either green-yellow, yellow, or absent, and the shape and size varies by species.<ref name=Meerow98/>{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Androecium]] :\nThe six [[stamens]] are inserted at the base of the perianth, and are very short (shorter than the inner perianth segments), the anthers basifixed (attached at their base) with filaments much shorter than the anthers and [[dehisce]] (open) by terminal [[stoma|pores]] or short slits.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Gynoecium]], [[Fruit]] and [[Seeds]]:\nThe inferior [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is three-celled. The [[style (botany)|style]] is slender and longer than the anthers, the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] are minutely capitate. The ovary ripens into a three-celled [[capsule (botany)|capsule]] fruit. This fruit is fleshy, ellipsoid or almost spherical, opening by three flaps with seeds that are light brown to white and oblong with a small appendage or tail ([[elaiosome]]) containing substances attractive to [[ant]]s, which distribute the seeds.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}<ref name=Dahlgren/>\n\nThe [[chromosome number]] is 2n=24.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;7}}<ref name=Meerow98/>\n\n[[Floral formula]]: <math>\\star\\; P_{3+3} \\; A_{3+3} \\; G_{\\overline{(3)}}</math>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Distribution of the galanthus species.png|thumb|450px|right|Distribution map of ''Galanthus'' species in Europe and Western Asia]]\nThe genus ''Galanthus'' is native to Europe and the Middle East, from the Spanish and French [[Pyrenees]] in the west through to the [[Caucasus]] and [[Iran]] in the east, and south to [[Sicily]], the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Aegean islands|Aegean]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].

[[Colesbourne|Colesbourne Park]] in [[Gloucestershire]] is one of the best known of the English snowdrop gardens, being the home of [[Henry John Elwes]], a collector of Galanthus specimens, and after whom ''Galanthus elwesii'' is named.{{sfn|Colesbourne Park |2011}}{{sfn|Ellis|2010}}\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[File:Snowdrop with six petals.jpg|thumb|Snowdrop with extra tepals (mutation)]]\nNumerous single- and double-flowered [[cultivars]] of ''Galanthus nivalis'' are known, and also of several other ''Galanthus'' species, particularly ''G. plicatus'' and ''G. elwesii''. Also, many hybrids between these and other species exist (more than 500 cultivars are described in Bishop, Davis, and Grimshaw's book, plus lists of many cultivars that have now been lost, and others not seen by the authors). They differ particularly in the size, shape, and markings of the flower, the period of flowering, and other characteristics, mainly of interest to the keen (even fanatical) snowdrop collectors, known as \"[[galanthophile]]s\", who hold meetings where the scarcer cultivars change hands.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;329}} &nbsp;Double-flowered cultivars and forms, such as the extremely common ''Galanthus nivalis'' [[Form (botany)|f.]] ''pleniflorus'' 'Flore Pleno', may be less attractive to some people, but they can have greater visual impact in a garden setting.

A young orphan girl is sent out during a snow storm by her cruel stepmother to find the spirits of the 12 months of the year, who take pity on her and not only save her from freezing to death, but also make it possible for her to gather the flowers even in winter. The [[The Twelve Months (1956 film)|Soviet traditionally animated film ''The Twelve Months'' (1956)]], [[Lenfilm]] film [[The Twelve Months (1972 film)|''The Twelve Months'' (1972)]] and the anime film [[Twelve Months (1980 film)|''Twelve Months'' (1980)]] (''Sekai meisaku dowa mori wa ikiteiru'' in Japan) are based on this fairy-tale play.\n* \"Snowdrops\" was the nickname that the British people gave during the Second World War to the [[military police]] of the United States Army (who were stationed in the UK preparatory to the invasion of the continent) because they wore a white helmet, gloves, gaiters, and [[Sam Browne belt]] against their olive drab uniforms.\n* In the German fairy tale, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', \"Snowdrop\" is used as an alternate name for the Princess [[Snow White]].  \n* The short story ''The Snowdrop'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] follows the fate of a snowdrop from a bulb striving toward the light to a picked flower placed in a book of poetry.\n*  Russian composer Tchaikovsky wrote a series of 12 piano pieces, each one named after a month of the year with a second name suggesting something associated with that month. His \"April\" piece is subnamed \"Snow Drop.\" The Russian climate having a later spring, and winter ending a bit later than in other places.\n\n===Symbols ===\nEarly names refer to the association with the [[religious feast]] of [[Candlemas]] (February 2) the optimum flowering time in which white-robed young women proceeded in the procession associated with the [[Purification of the Virgin|Purification]], an alternative name for the feast day. The [[French language|French]] name of ''Violette de la Chandaleur'' refers to Candlemas, while an [[Italian language|Italian]] name, ''Fiore della purificazone'', refers to purification.

Sasha's parents had been killed in a house fire that he was accused of starting through [[Magician (paranormal)|wizardry]]. Pyetr is one of the town's audacious young men, and one day he is attacked and wounded by old Yurishev for having a liaison with his young wife. Pyetr escapes, but later learns that Yurishev is dead, and that he has been accused of murdering him by [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]. Pyetr hides in the stables at the inn, and Sasha helps him leave the town. With no future for himself in Vojvoda, Sasha accompanies the wounded Pyetr.\n\nPyetr and Sasha walk for days through fields and into a dead forest. Sasha does not believe he is a wizard, but finds he sometimes has the ability to successfully wish for things. Pyetr does not believe in wizards at all, and laughs at Sasha's wishing. Exhausted and without food, the pair find a cottage by a river. Its occupant, a wizard named Uulamets, heals Pyetr and agrees to let them stay on condition that they help him find his daughter, Eveshka, who had drowned when she was 16 and is now a [[rusalka]]. Pyetr is suspicious of Uulamets and does not believe in rusalkas.{{refn|In her book, Cherryh uses the pural \"rusalkas\", not \"rusalki\".{{sfn|Cherryh|2010|p=86}}|group=\"nb\"}} Later, while the three of them are searching for Eveshka, she makes herself visible to Pyetr, overpowers him, and leads him into the forest. Rusalkas are renowned for drowning men they have chosen, but Eveshka abandons Pyetr and disappears again. Uulamets and Sasha find Pyetr unharmed, but are attacked by Hwiuur, a [[shapeshifting]] [[Vodyanoy|vodyanoi]], known to drown people who go too close to the water.\n\nUulamets traps Hwiuur and threatens to kill it. The creature pleads for its life and admits to drowning Eveshka, but blames Chernevog, a former student of Uulamets. Eveshka had fallen in love with Chernevog and run off with him, but Chernevog had used his newly acquired wizardry to control her, and then handed her over to Hwiuur. Even as a rusalka Chernevog still controls Eveshka and will not let her return to her father. Uulamets agrees to let Hwiuur go on condition that he helps them find Chernevog.\n\nWhile searching for Chernevog, Pyetr spots Eveshka and chases after her. Sasha wants to follow Pyetr to protect him, but Uulamets wills Sasha to stay. Uulamets had recognised Sasha's potential for wizardry and taught him how to use his talents, but stressed the dangers of unchecked wishing and the importance of considering their consequences first. Pyetr, who now has feelings for Eveshka, and is slowly accepting this new world of wizards, rusalkas and river creatures, finds her and together they locate Chernevog's house in the forest. Chernevog immediately takes control of Pyetr and instructs Hwiuur to guard him. As Uulamets and Sasha approach the house Chernevog starts sending lightning bolts at them, but Uulamets is able to redirect them back at the house, setting it ablaze. In the chaos, Pyetr breaks free of Hwiuur and overpowers a weakened Chernevog. Uulamets then casts a wizard's once-in-a-lifetime spell and commands Eveshka to \"live!\".{{sfn|Cherryh|2010|p=295}} This final wish kills the wizard but resurrects Eveshka. Sasha discovers that that spell also bestowed on him all of the wizard's knowledge and abilities.\n\nChernevog is unconscious, but Sasha cannot kill him and instead puts him into a long, deep sleep. Hwiuur has disappeared, and [[leshy]]s{{refn|In her book, Cherryh uses the pural \"leshys\", not \"leshies\".{{sfn|Cherryh|2010|p=36}}|group=\"nb\"}}, woodland spirits, appear and celebrate the downfall of Chernevog.
