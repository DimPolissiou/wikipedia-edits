''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> was an American company that was founded in July 1802 in Wilmington, Delaware, as a [[gunpowder mill]] by [[French-American]] chemist and industrialist [[\u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont]].\n\nIn the 20th century, DuPont developed many [[polymer]]s such as [[Vespel]], [[neoprene]], [[nylon]], [[Corian]], [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[Mylar]], [[Kapton]], [[Kevlar]], Zemdrain, [[M5 fiber]], [[Nomex]], [[Tyvek]], [[Sorona]], [[Artificial Leather#Corfam|Corfam]], and [[Lycra]]. DuPont developed [[Freon]] ([[chlorofluorocarbon]]s) for the [[refrigerant]] industry, and later other refrigerants.

He started the company at the [[Eleutherian Mills]], on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], near [[Wilmington, Delaware]], two years after du Pont and his family left France to escape the [[French Revolution]] and religious persecution against [[Huguenot]] Protestants. The company began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the [[United States military]], supplying half the powder used by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\n=== Expansion: 1902 to 1912 ===\nDuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of [[dynamite]] and [[smokeless powder]]. In 1902, DuPont's president, [[Eugene du Pont]], died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. [[Charles Lee Reese]] was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Class of 811 Graduated: Sketches of Honored Alumni|date=June 27, 1919|publisher=The Pennsylvania Gazette|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=875|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AgA9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA875&lpg=PA875&dq=dupont+charles+lee+reese#v=onepage&q=dupont%20charles%20lee%20reese&f=false|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies; in 1912 these actions generated government scrutiny under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered [[divestment]]. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the [[Hercules Powder Company]] (later [[Hercules Inc.]] and now part of [[Ashland Inc.]]) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) and now part of [[AkzoNobel]]).<ref>{{Cite journal\n |title       = The DuPont Company\n |publisher   = [[Delaware Historical Society]]\n |url         = http://www.hsd.org/DHE/DHE_what_industry_DuPont.htm\n |accessdate  = March 29, 2006\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110603235525/http://www.hsd.org/DHE/DHE_what_industry_DuPont.htm\n |archivedate = June 3, 2011\n |df          = mdy\n}}</ref> At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single-base [[nitrocellulose]] powders, while Hercules held the double-base powders combining nitrocellulose and [[nitroglycerine]].

The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional and inefficient means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/dupont/FarmingWithDynamite/|title=Farming with Dynamite|access-date=December 12, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219071441/http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/dupont/FarmingWithDynamite/|archivedate=December 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on [[cellulose]] chemistry, [[lacquer]]s and other non-explosive products. [[DuPont Central Research]] was established at the [[DuPont Experimental Station]], across the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] from the original powder mills.\n\n=== Automotive investments: 1914 ===\nIn 1914, [[Pierre S. du Pont]] invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (GM). The following year he was invited to be on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.\n\n=== Major breakthroughs: 1920s\u20131930s ===\n[[File:Marker outside DuPont's Belle Plant in Dupont City, West Virginia.jpg|thumb|upright|A marker outside DuPont's Belle Plant in [[Dupont City, West Virginia]], where ammonia was first synthesized for commercial use.]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Duponts \"Orlon\" Plant, Camden, S.

In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the [[Savannah River Plant]] in [[South Carolina]] as part of the effort to create a [[hydrogen bomb]].\n\nDuPont was one of an estimated 150 American companies that provided Germany with patents, technology and material resources that proved crucial to the [[German re-armament|German war effort]].

In the [[World War II|Second World War]] DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Royal Air Force]] to make [[flak jacket]]s. With the development of [[Kevlar]] in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the [[Bulletproof vest|bullet-resistant vests]] that are used by police and military units.\n\n=== Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999 ===\nIn 1981, DuPont acquired [[Conoco Inc.]], a major American oil and gas producing company, which gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products.

He started the company at the [[Eleutherian Mills]], on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], near [[Wilmington, Delaware]], two years after du Pont and his family left France to escape the [[French Revolution]] and religious persecution against [[Huguenot]] Protestants. The company began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the [[United States military]], supplying half the powder used by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\n=== Expansion: 1902 to 1912 ===\nDuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of [[dynamite]] and [[smokeless powder]].

The following year he was invited to be on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.\n\n=== Major breakthroughs: 1920s\u20131930s ===\n[[File:Marker outside DuPont's Belle Plant in Dupont City, West Virginia.jpg|thumb|upright|A marker outside DuPont's Belle Plant in [[Dupont City, West Virginia]], where ammonia was first synthesized for commercial use.]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Duponts \"Orlon\" Plant, Camden, S.
