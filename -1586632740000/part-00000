These addons can be installed separately as plugins in Kodi.\n\nThe PVR backend can either be a DVR set-top box connected to the network or a PC with a digital video recorder software. This software can run on the same computer or on other computers on the same network. The PVR software can turn computers or other appliances into DVRs.

It can play media from an internal built-in [[hard disk drive]] and [[Server Message Block|SMB/SAMBA/CIFS]] shares (Windows File-Sharing), [[Network File System|NFS]], or stream them over [[ReplayTV]] DVRs/PVRs, [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) or [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] (DLNA) shares, or stream [[iTunes]]-shares via [[Digital Audio Access Protocol]] (DAAP).

Kodi includes the option to submit music usage statistics to [[Last.fm]] and [[Libre.fm]]. It has music/video-playlist features, picture/image-slideshow functions, an MP3+CDG [[karaoke]] function and many [[Music visualization|audio-visualizations]] and [[screensaver]]s. Kodi can [[Upscaling DVD|upscale/upconvert]] all [[SDTV|standard-definition]] resolution videos and output them to [[HDTV|720p, 1080i, and 1080p high-definition]] resolutions.<ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application.

It can decode these audio and video formats in software or hardware, and optionally pass-through [[Dolby Digital|AC3]]/[[DTS Coherent Acoustics|DTS]] audio, or encode to AC3 in real time from movies directly to [[S/PDIF]] digital output to an external audio-[[Audio amplifier|amplifier]]/[[Audio receiver#Hi-Fi / Home theater|receiver]] for decoding.<ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application. Period.\" />\n\n===Addons Manager, addons and plugins===\nKodi features several open [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to enable [[third-party developer]]s to create capabilities which extend Kodi with a multitude of [[Plug-in (computing)|addons]], such as audio and video streaming plugins for online sources, screensavers, skins and themes, visualizations, weather forecasts, web interfaces, web scrapers, widget scripts, and more. Kodi developers encourage users to make and submit their own addons to expand media content and [[value-added service]]s accessible from within Kodi.\n\nKodi/XBMC features, since version 10.0 (codename: \"Dharma\"), an Addons Framework architecture and an Addons Manager GUI client that connects to a [[decentralized]] [[digital distribution]] service [[Platform (computing)|platform]] that serves add-on apps and [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] which among other things provide online content to Kodi, the \"Addons Manager\" (or \"Addons Browser\") inside Kodi allows users to browse and download new addons directly from Kodi's GUI.\n\nMany of these online content sources are in [[over-the-top content]] high definition services and use video streaming site as sources for the media content that is offered. Kodi has extensibility and integration with online sources for free and premium streaming content, and offers content from everything from commercial video to free educational programming, and media from individuals and small businesses. Not all content sources on add-ons are available in every country, however. Due to rights agreements, many content sources are geo-restricted to prevent users in outside countries from accessing content, although some have taken to bypassing the regional restrictions in order to unblock these sources, disregarding the usage rights.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wtvpc.com/unblock-kodi-tv-add-ons/ |title=How To Unblock Kodi TV Add-Ons {{!}} wTVPC |website=wtvpc.com |access-date=6 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912074402/http://wtvpc.com/unblock-kodi-tv-add-ons/ |archive-date=12 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Plugins and scripts====\nKodi features an integrated Python Scripts interpreter for addon extensions, and WindowXML [[application framework]] (a XML-based [[widget toolkit]] engine for creating a GUI for apps and [[widget (computing)|widgets]]) in a similar fashion to Apple macOS [[Dashboard (macOS)|Dashboard Widgets]] and [[Microsoft Gadgets]]. Python widget scripts allow normal users to add new functionality to Kodi themselves, using Python scripting language. Current [[plugins|plugin]] scripts include functions like [[Internet television|Internet-TV]] and [[trailer (film)|movie-trailer]] browsers, cinemaguides, weather forecast, [[over-the-top content]] video streaming services like YouTube, [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]], [[Veoh]], [[MLB.tv]], Internet-radio-station browsers such as Pandora Radio, online picture sharing sites like [[Flickr]], TV guides such as [[TVShow Time]], e-mail clients, [[instant messaging]], different timetables, [[home automation]] scripts to [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] control PVR software and hardware, [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing downloaders ([[BitTorrent]]), [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], also [[casual game]]s such as ''[[Tetris]]''.<ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application. Period.\" /><ref name=\"XBMC 9.04 delivers impressive media center experience\" />\n\n====Metadata extraction and web scrapers====\nKodi has the built-in optional function to automatically download [[metadata]] information, [[cover art]] and other related media artwork online through its [[web scraping|web scrapers]] that looks for media in the user's audio and video folders and their sub-directories. These \"scrapers\" are used as [[Importer (computing)|importers]] to obtain detailed information from various Internet resources about movies and television shows. It can get synopses, reviews, movie posters, titles, genre classification, and other similar data. XBMCGUI then provides a rich display for audio and video files that the scrapers have identified.\n\nScrapers use sites like [[The Movie Database]] (TMDb) or [[IMDb.com]] to obtain [[thumbnails]] and information on movies, [[TheTVDB|thetvdb.com]] for TV show posters and episode plots, [[CDDB]] for audio CD track listings, and [[Allmusic|Allmusic (AMG)]] and [[MusicBrainz]] for album [[thumbnails]], reviews, and metadata.\n\nFanart.tv has been added to the list of information sources and XBMC can use it to retrieve logos, backgrounds, CDs with transparent backgrounds, album covers and banners among other image types for music artists, TV shows and movies, the popularity of which contributed to XBMC being able to handle new image types.\n\n===Skins and themes===\nLike the majority of applications that originated from a '[[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]]' scene, modification and customization of the interface using [[skin (computing)|skin]]s is very popular among Kodi users and hundreds of skins and themes are available for users to install. The Kodi skinning engine's flexibility is also advantageous to third parties wanting to create derivative works, as it facilitates rebranding the environment and making deeper changes to the look and feel of the user interface.\n\nAs of Kodi version 17, the official default skins for new installs are \"Estuary\", for typical [[Home theater PC|home-theater]] usage, and \"Estouchy\" for [[touchscreen]]s.  These newly designed skins replace the longtime default skin \"Confluence\", and are intended to present more content on the homescreen, be easier for new users, and bring \"Kodi into the present day of UI design.\"\n\nUsers can also create their own skin (or simply modify an existing skin) and share it with others via public websites that are used for Kodi skin trading and development. Many such third-party skins exist that are well maintained by the community, and while some skins are originals with unique designs, most begin as a clone or an exact replica of other multimedia software interfaces, such as [[Apple Front Row]], [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Windows Media Center Edition]] (MCE), MediaPortal, [[Wii Menu|Wii Channel Menu (Xii)]], [[Xbox 360#Software|Xbox 360 interface]], and others.<ref name=\"Customize XBMC with These Five Awesome Skins\">{{Cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5198009/customize-xbmc-with-these-five-awesome-skins |title=Customize XBMC with These Five Awesome Skins |last=Jason Fitzpatrick |date=5 April 2009 |website=Lifehacker |access-date=15 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204125706/https://lifehacker.com/5198009/customize-xbmc-with-these-five-awesome-skins |archive-date=4 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to skins and themes users can create a themed package called a 'build'. Within this package homebrew developers are able to distribute a skin and multiple addons. The delivery mechanism used within the Kodi scene is called a wizard with the Replicant Wizard<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://replicant.run/signup |title=Replicant Wizard - Register}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> being the most prominent.\n\n===Web Interfaces===\nWeb Interface addons for Kodi normally allow browsing a media library remotely, to handle music playlists from a computer instead of television. Others allow remotely controlling the navigation of XBMC like a remote for [[Touchscreen remote control|remote controlling]] of an installed and concurrently active Kodi session running on a computer if it runs on an internet tablet or similar device with a touch interface. Others act like a media manager to allow modifying metadata and artwork in XBMC's video and music libraries.\n\n===Application launcher===\nKodi has a \"My Programs\" section which is meant to function as an application launcher for third-party [[application software|software]] such as computer games and [[List of emulators|video game emulator]]s, all from a [[GUI]] with [[thumbnail]] and different listings options. However, while this feature was fully functioning on the Xbox version of XBMC, it is still in its infant stage on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows, thus requiring third-party launcher plugins to function properly.<ref name=\"Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine\" />\n\n==Mobile remotes and second screen apps==\nThere are many software applications for mobile devices available for and associated with Kodi. Some of these mobile apps just works as simple remote controls, while others function as more advanced [[second screen]] companion apps, offering additional information about what users are viewing or listening to on Kodi, such as [[metadata]] about movie actors and music artists, with links to other works available from those persons in their collection or online.\n\n\"XBMC Remote for Android\" and \"XBMC Remote for iOS\" are free and open source official apps for mobile devices released by Team-Kodi/Team-XBMC on [[Google Play]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices and the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for [[iOS Devices]], such as [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]].

Through the processing power of more recent computer hardware, XBMC can decode [[high-definition video]] up to and beyond [[1080p]] resolutions, bypassing hardware limitations of the Xbox version of XBMC.\n\nIn recent releases of Kodi-XBMC there is [[Video Acceleration API|hardware accelerated video decoding]] for [[DXVA]], [[VDPAU]], [[VA-API]] GPU hardware video decoding, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via [[ARM NEON]], and [[OpenMAX]], Broadcom Crystal HD.<ref name=\"XBMC 9.04 delivers impressive media center experience\" /><ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3701 |title=XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs |last=Anand Lal Shimpi |date=29 December 2009 |website=AnandTech |access-date=20 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122122537/http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3701 |archive-date=22 January 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The source code for XBMC is actively updated by developers in a public [[Git (software)|Git repository]], which may contain features and functionality not yet incorporated into the most recent \"stable\" releases.\n\n===Kodibuntu===\nKodibuntu (formerly ''XBMCbuntu'') was a free [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based [[Linux distribution]] with Kodi (formerly ''XBMC'') for Linux already installed and pre-configured, providing a complete packaged media center software suite for all IA-32/x86-based personal computers. Kodibuntu uses Kodi software for all media playback and is primarily designed for [[Just enough operating system|bare-metal installation]]s to achieve [[instant-on]] type [[Booting|boot]] to achieve a set-top box experience on an HTPC. It replaced XBMCbuntu which in turn replaced XBMC Live, the former official [[Live CD]] (Linux) distribution.\n\nKodibuntu was based on [[Lubuntu]], an Ubuntu Linux fork that was \"lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient\" than the standard Ubuntu desktop distributions. The [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] Remote and IR-receiver dongle works directly with Kodibuntu out of the box, which means  Windows Media Center users with these common peripherals can use Kodibuntu without requiring any additional hardware.\n\nFollowing the principles of [[MythTV#Operating system bundles|MythTV distributions]] and [[GeeXboX]], Kodibuntu is designed to simplify the permanent installation of Kodi onto a computer for use as a dedicated home theater PC. The user can directly install XBMC from the bootable CD onto a USB flash drive or internal hard disk drive, since it comes with a complete instant-on ([[Linux kernel]]-based) [[embedded operating system]]. When installed on a USB flash drive or internal hard disk drive, Kodibuntu can save settings and make updates to XBMC and the operating system back to that drive.\n\n===Native applications===\n''Kodi for Linux'' (formerly ''XBMC for Linux'') is primarily developed for Ubuntu Linux and Kodi's developers' own Kodibuntu (formerly ''XBMCbuntu''). Third-party packages for most other Linux distributions are also available, and it is possible to compile XBMC Media Center from scratch for any Linux distribution, as long as the required dependency libraries are installed first. Hardware accelerated video decoding is achieved via the [[VDPAU]] API on Nvidia's GPUs, the [[VAAPI]] API for [[AMD Radeon|AMD/ATI Radeon]], [[S3 Graphics]], and Intel's newer [[Integrated Graphics Processor]]s, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via [[OpenMAX]], [[ARM NEON]], and Broadcom Crystal HD on systems with supporting hardware.<ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\" /> Development version of Kodi/XBMC for Linux is available at [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] as [[Personal Package Archive|PPA (Personal Package Archive)]] for the standard Ubuntu Desktop version 8.04 and later, as well as [[deb (file format)|DEB packages]] for [[Debian]].\n\n''Kodi for OS X''(formerly ''XBMC for Mac'') runs natively on {{nowrap|Mac OS X Tiger}} and later, as well as on the Apple TV. 1080p playback can be achieved on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers either via software decoding on the CPU, if it is powerful enough, or by hardware-accelerated video decoding for hardware supporting Apple's VDA API or video decoders such as the Broadcom Crystal HD.<ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\" />\n\n1080p playback on the first-generation Apple TV (a.k.a. \"ATV1\") can only be achieved by hardware accelerated video decoding via Broadcom Crystal HD; the user must replace the ATV's internal WiFi adapter with a Broadcom Crystal HD [[PCI Express Mini Card|PCI Express Mini (mini-PCIe) card]] in order to activate this functionality.<ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\" />\n\n''Kodi for Windows'' (formerly ''XBMC for Windows'') runs natively on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 as a [[32-bit]] or [[64-bit]] application. 1080p and Ultra HD (4K) playback can be achieved on Windows computers either via software decoding on the CPU, if it's powerful enough, or by hardware accelerated video decoding.\n\nHardware video decoding via [[DirectX Video Acceleration]] is supported, although this enhancement only runs on Windows 7 (or later?) since it uses the DXVA 2.0 API, which was not supported in Windows XP.\n\n''Kodi for iOS'' (formerly ''XBMC for iOS''), a full port of Kodi to Apple's iOS operating-system, was released publicly on 20 January 2011. It supported both 720p and 1080p hardware accelerated video decoding of [[H.264]] videos, and was compatible with Apple's iDevices that use [[Apple A4]] or [[Apple A5]] (ARM-based) processors with a jailbroken iOS operating-system.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/01/xbmc-on-appletv-ios-jailbreak |title=XBMC now running on jailbroken Apple TV or iDevice |last=Foresman |first=Chris |date=21 January 2011 |publisher=Arstechnica.com |access-date=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2017 [https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/iosapps/how-install-kodi-on-iphone-or-ipad-without-jailbreaking-3634908/ MacWorld UK described] how to install on iOS devices before iOS 11 without jailbreak.\n\n''Kodi for Android'' (formerly ''XBMC for Android'') is a full port of the complete Kodi/XBMC application to Google's Android operating-system, officially compatible with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later versions supporting [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|API Level 14]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.html |title=Android 4.0 APIs |access-date=3 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329115550/http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.html |archive-date=29 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> was first announced and its source code released publicly on 13 June 2012.

This is also the real reason why XBMC for Android does not support the original [[Google TV]]; since the Android NDK was not made available for older Google TV devices it means that Kodi/XBMC could not be compiled for it today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://spurint.org/journal/2012/10/google-tv-and-native-libraries/ |title=Google TV and Native Libraries |publisher=Spurint.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106032747/http://spurint.org/journal/2012/10/google-tv-and-native-libraries/ |archive-date=6 January 2013 |access-date=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Xbox (first-generation)===\n{{Main|XBMC4Xbox}}\nXBMC 9.04 (codename: ''Babylon'') point-release version of XBMC for Xbox, now obsolete, was released on 6 May 2009 as the last official version of XBMC for Xbox. The original developers of XBMC have since issued a statement stating they will no longer develop or support XBMC for Xbox as part of the XBMC project as of 27 May 2010. The development of XBMC for Xbox ended because the focus for all Team XBMC developers has completely shifted to the Linux, Mac, and Windows versions of XBMC instead.\n\nEven though the original XBMC project no longer develops or supports XBMC for the Xbox, an XBMC version for the Xbox is still available via the third-party developer spin-off project \"[[XBMC4Xbox]]\", who have completely taken over the development and support of XBMC for the original Xbox.<ref name=\"XBMC Discontinues Xbox Support\" /><ref name=\"XBMC Drops Support for the Original Xbox\" /><ref name=\"XBMC4Xbox\" />\n\nXBMC for Xbox was never an authorized/signed Microsoft product, therefore a [[Xbox modding|modification of the Xbox]] is required in order to run XBMC on an Xbox game-console. XBMC for Xbox can be run as an application (like any Xbox game), or as a [[Xbox Dashboard|dashboard]] that appears directly when the Xbox is turned on.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" /><ref name=\"Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine\" /> Since XBMC for Xbox was part of an open source software program, its development [[source code]] was stored on a publicly accessible [[subversion (software)|subversion repository]]. Accordingly, unofficial [[executable]] builds from the subversion repository are often released by third parties on sites unaffiliated with the official XBMC project.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" /><ref name=\"Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine\" />\n\n===Xbox One===\nOn 29 December 2017, Kodi developers announced via the news section of their official website that a Kodi app had been released for the [[Xbox One]]. It is noted that the [[Universal Windows Platform|UWP]] version will retain the characteristic Kodi appearance, however, many core features are missing or broken.\n\n==Commercial systems==\n{{list spam|section|date=April 2017}}\nThe developers of Kodi (formerly ''XBMC'') state that as long as the GPL licensing of the Kodi software is respected they would love Kodi to run on as many third-party hardware platforms and [[operating system]]s as possible, as \"'''Powered by Kodi'''\" (or \"'''Powered by XBMC'''\") branded devices and systems. They envision Kodi being pre-installed as a [[third-party software component]] that commercial and non-commercial [[Original design manufacturer|ODM]]s and [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s and [[systems integrator]] companies can use [[royalty-free]] on their own hardware, hardware such as [[set-top box]]es from [[Television station|cable-TV companies]], [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[Video game console|game-consoles]], or [[Embedded system|embedded computers]] and [[System-on-a-chip|SoC (System-on-a-Chip)]] built into [[television set]]s for web-enabled TVs, and other entertainment devices for the living room entertainment system, [[home cinema]], or similar uses.\n\nBelow is a list of third-party companies that sell hardware bundled with Kodi or XBMC software pre-installed, or sell uninstalled systems that specifically claim to be Kodi- or XBMC-compatible.

Some of Kodi's own [[library (computing)|libraries]], as well as many third-party libraries that Kodi depends on, are written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming-language]], instead of {{nowrap|C++}} as Kodi's core, but they are then mostly used with a {{nowrap|C++}} wrapper and, through Kodi's core monolithic nature, are loaded via a [[dynamic linker]] [[Loader (computing)|loader]] for on-demand loading and unloading at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].<ref name=\"XBMC 9.04 delivers impressive media center experience\" /> Kodi also still partially uses the SDL ([[Simple DirectMedia Layer]]) multimedia [[Software framework|framework]] for input on Linux, but its developers are working on completely removing that small remaining dependency on SDL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://codedocs.xyz/CodeDocs/xbmc/modules.html |title=Kodi Documentation: Modules |website=CodeDocs.xyz |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152308/https://codedocs.xyz/CodeDocs/xbmc/modules.html |archive-date=30 August 2017 |access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause of Kodi/XBMC's origin with the resource constraints on the hardware and environment of the first-generation Xbox game-console platform, all software development of Kodi/XBMC has always been focused on reserving the limited resources that existed on embedded system hardware, like the original Xbox (which was only a 733&nbsp;MHz [[Intel Pentium III]] and 64&nbsp;MB of RAM in total as [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]]), as well as the still relatively low resources of [[embedded system]] devices today, of which the main hindrance has always been the amount of available system [[random access memory|RAM]] and graphics memory at any one time. This means that Kodi/XBMC is purposely programmed to be very resource- and power-efficient and can therefore run on very low-end and relatively non-expensive hardware, especially when compared to other media center software design for HTPC use.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\nBut because of its origins from the Xbox game-console, Kodi/XBMC's legacy [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics renderer]] still runs in a more game-loop rendering environment rather than using a fully event-driven and on-demand rendering, meaning that it is almost constantly re-drawing the GUI and refreshing the frames as fast as it can, even when nothing is changing on the screen. This results in very high CPU and high GPU usage, which can be observed on embedded systems and low-end machines, and hence cause high temperatures, high fan activity, and high power consumption unless capped at a maximum frame per second configuration for that specific platform build. Work is however constantly ongoing by the developers to make Kodi/XBMC run using much fewer resources on low-power and embedded systems, which will indirectly benefit all non-embedded systems as well. Efficiency improvements in this area are however being worked on in order to move away from that old style game-loop environment in order to reduce high CPU/GPU usage by the GUI, especially as XBMC usage on embedded platforms with limited CPU/GPU resources keeps growing in popularity. XBMC 11.0 (Eden) introduced Dirty-Regions rendering option for texture support to the XBMC skinning engine as an option, and XBMC 12.0 (Frodo) enabled Dirty Regions rendering to redraw the whole screen on a single dirty region by default on all platforms. Work is also in progress for XBMC 14.0 to introduce an abstracted scene-graph deferred rendering for GUI renderer abstraction.\n\n====Portability====\nKodi has a [[Software portability|portable code base]], with its [[Trunk (software)|trunk (mainline source code tree)]] officially available for [[IA-32]]/[[x86]], [[x86-64]], [[PowerPC]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based platforms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tegradeveloper.nvidia.com/tegra/project/xbmc |title=XBMC on NVIDIA Tegra |website=Tegradeveloper.Nvidia.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100112142539/http://tegradeveloper.nvidia.com/tegra/project/xbmc |archive-date=12 January 2010 |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>http://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010_Projects/XBMC {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923042204/http://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010_Projects/XBMC |date=23 September 2010 }} BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010 Projects/XBMC</ref> The Kodi GUI does require 3D hardware accelerated graphics ([[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]) that support [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenGL]], or [[EGL (OpenGL)|EGL]], or [[Direct3D]] with device drivers that support [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0, or OpenGL 1.3 or later with [[GLSL]], or [[DirectX]] in order to [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the GUI at an acceptable [[frame rate]].\n\nKodi is thus officially not yet available for [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] upstream in mainline source code repository from Team-Kodi, nor does it as yet support [[DirectFB]] or [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure)]] rendering without OpenGL/GLES hardware accelerated graphics support.<ref name=\"XBMC ARM port teased, will manage HD playback from pocket-sized Beagleboard (video)\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/02/xbmc-arm-port-teased-will-manage-hd-playback-from-pocket-sized/ |title=XBMC ARM port teased, will manage HD playback from pocket-sized Beagleboard (video) |last=Tim Stevens |date=2 November 2009 |website=Engadget |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519200536/https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/02/xbmc-arm-port-teased-will-manage-hd-playback-from-pocket-sized/ |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The combination of MIPS, DirectFB, and DRI is a popular architecture used today by simpler [[set-top box]]es like digital broadcasting (cable/satellite) boxes and low-end [[digital media player]]s, such as those based on [[MIPS architecture]] chipsets from [[Sigma Designs]] or [[Realtek]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iboum.com/artkill/chipsets.php |title=Media Player Chipsets |publisher=Iboum.com |access-date=24 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123135059/http://www.iboum.com/artkill/chipsets.php |archive-date=23 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kodi ports to MIPS is, however, currently being actively worked on by several independent development teams.\n\nKodi for Linux supports [[toolchain]] building systems for embedded development such as [[Yocto Project|Yocto]], [[Buildroot]] ([[uClibc]]), and the [[Linaro]] set of Makefiles and patches for easing the generation of [[Cross compiler|cross-compilation]] toolchains as well as the creation of a file system on [[embedded Linux]] systems across a wide range of hardware, kernel platforms, and CPU architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.).\n\n===Python scripts as plugins and addons (widgets and gadgets)===\nKodi allows developers to create addons using a built-in [[Python (programming language)|Python interpreter]] (version 2.6 or higher depending on system) and its own WindowXML [[application framework]], which together form an XML-based widget toolkit for which they can extend the capability of Kodi by creating a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] for [[GUI widget|widgets]].

Xbox Media Player development stopped on 13 December 2003, by which time its successor was ready for its debut, renamed as it was growing out of its 'player' name and into a 'center' for media playback. The first stable release of XBMC was on 29 June 2004, with the official release of XboxMediaCenter 1.0.0. This announcement also encouraged everyone using XBMP or XBMC Beta release to update, as all support for those previous versions would be dropped, and they would only support version 1.0.0. Not featured in XBMP, the addition of embedded [[Python (programming language)|Python]] was given the ability to draw interface elements in the GUI, and allowed user and community generated scripts to be executed within the XBMC environment.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\nWith the release of 1.0.0 in the middle of 2004, work continued on the XBMC project to add more features, such as support for iTunes features like DAAP and Smart Playlists, as well as lots of improvements and fixes. The second stable release of XBMC, 1.1.0, was released on 18 October 2004. This release included support for more media types, file types, container formats, as well as video playback of Nullsoft streaming videos and karaoke support (CD-G).<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\nAfter two years of heavy development, XBMC announced a stable point final release of XBMC 2.0.0 on 29 September 2006. Even more features were packed into the new version with the addition of RAR and zip archive support, a brand new player interface with support for multiple players. Such players include PAPlayer, the new audio/music player with crossfade, gapless playback and ReplayGain support, and the new DVDPlayer with support for menu and navigation support as well as ISO/img image parsing. Prior to this point release, XBMC just used a modified fork of [[MPlayer]] for all of its media needs, so this was a big step forward. Support for iTunes 6.x DAAP, and Upnp Clients for streaming was also added. A reworked Skinning Engine was included in this release to provide a more powerful way to change the appearance of XBMC. The last two features include read-only support for FAT12/16/32 formatted [[USB mass storage]] devices, and a \"skinnable\" 3D visualizer.\n\nThe release of XBMC 2.0.1 on 12 November 2006 contained numerous fixes for bugs that made it through the 2.0.0 release. This also marked the change from CVS to SVN (Subversion) for the development tree.\n\nOn 29 May 2007, the team behind XBMC put out a call for developers interested in porting XBMC to the Linux operating system. A few developers on Team-XBMC had already begun porting parts of XBMC over to Linux using SDL and OpenGL as a replacement for DirectX, which XBMC was using heavily on the Xbox version of XBMC.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/10/history-of-boxee-and-boxee-was-born-slowly/ |title=History Of Boxee: And Boxee Was Born, Slowly |date=19 October 2010 |website=Gizmodo.com.au |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830145826/https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/10/history-of-boxee-and-boxee-was-born-slowly/ |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/tags/history-of-boxee/ |title=Gizmodo Australia - the Gadget Guide - Technology and consumer electronics news and reviews |website=www.Gizmodo.com.au |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152106/https://www.gizmodo.com.au/tags/history-of-boxee/ |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment on the Git codebase is continuing and the versioning scheme has been changed to reflect the release year and month, e.g., 8.10, 9.04, 9.11, 10.05.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, the team behind XBMC announced the splitting of the Xbox branch into a new project; \"XBMC4Xbox\" which will continue the development and support of XBMC for the old Xbox hardware platform as a separate project, with the original XBMC project no longer offering any support for the Xbox.<ref name=\"XBMC Discontinues Xbox Support\" /><ref name=\"XBMC Drops Support for the Original Xbox\" /><ref name=\"XBMC4Xbox\" />\n\nOn 2 January 2011, XBMC moved the source code repository from [[subversion (software)|subversion]] to [[Git (software)|git]], hosted at [[GitHub]].\n\nOn 1 August 2014, an announcement was made of release 14 and name change to Kodi.\n\n== Organization and licensing ==\nThe XBMC Foundation is the organization behind the Kodi and XBMC projects.

Powerful 3D GPU chips are common today in most modern computer platforms, including many [[set-top box]]es, and XBMC, now Kodi, was from the start designed to be otherwise very resource-efficient, for being as powerful and versatile a framework as it is. It runs well on what (by [[Intel Atom]] standards) are relatively underpowered [[OpenGL|OpenGL 1.3]] (with [[GLSL]] support), [[OpenGL ES|OpenGL ES 2.0]] or [[Direct3D|Direct3D (DirectX) 9.0]] capable systems that are [[IA-32]]/[[x86]], [[x86-64]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]] (AArch32 and AArch64), or [[PowerPC G4]] or later [[CPU]] based.<ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application.

Kodi can, however, offload most of the video decoding process onto graphics hardware controller or embedded video processing circuits that support one of the following types of hardware-accelerated [[video decoding]]: Google's MediaCodec API for Android, Intel's [[VAAPI]], Nvidia's [[VDPAU]] API, AMD's [[XvBA]] API, Microsoft's [[DXVA]] API, Apple's VDADecoder/VideoToolbox APIs, and the Khronos Group's [[OpenMAX]] API,<ref name=\"How to install Broadcom Crystal HD driver on Ubuntu?\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-broadcom-crystal-hd-driver-ubuntu/ |title=How to install Broadcom Crystal HD driver on Ubuntu? |last=Anand Subramanian |date=7 February 2014 |website=htpcBeginner |access-date=23 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403145722/http://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-broadcom-crystal-hd-driver-ubuntu/ |archive-date=3 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"phoronix1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAyODU |title=XBMC Project Implements AMD XvBA Interface |date=14 December 2011 |publisher=Phoronix.com |access-date=24 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202013131/http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTAyODU |archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[AMLogic]] VPU, [[Freescale Semiconductor|Freescale]]'s [[i.MX|i.MX6x series]] VPU, and [[Raspberry Pi]]'s GPU MMAL.

These addons can be installed separately as plugins in Kodi.\n\nThe PVR backend can either be a DVR set-top box connected to the network or a PC with a digital video recorder software. This software can run on the same computer or on other computers on the same network. The PVR software can turn computers or other appliances into DVRs.

This video-player \"core\" for video-playback is an in-house developed cross-platform media player, \"DVDPlayer\", which was designed to play back [[DVD-Video]] movies, and this includes support native for DVD-menus, (based on the free open source libraries code [[libdvdcss]] and libdvdnav). This [[FFmpeg]] based video-player \"core\" today supports all widespread mainstream formats. One relatively unusual feature of this DVD-player core is the capability to on-the-fly pause and play DVD-Video movies that are stored in [[ISO image|ISO and IMG]] DVD-images or DVD-Video ([[IFO]]/[[VOB]]/[[.bup|BUP]]) images (even directly from uncompressed [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] and [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] archives), from either local harddrive storage or network-share storage.<ref name=\"XBMC 9.11 makes your open source home theater look shinier\" /><ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application.

It can decode these audio and video formats in software or hardware, and optionally pass-through [[Dolby Digital|AC3]]/[[DTS Coherent Acoustics|DTS]] audio, or encode to AC3 in real time from movies directly to [[S/PDIF]] digital output to an external audio-[[Audio amplifier|amplifier]]/[[Audio receiver#Hi-Fi / Home theater|receiver]] for decoding.<ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application. Period.\" />\n\n===Addons Manager, addons and plugins===\nKodi features several open [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to enable [[third-party developer]]s to create capabilities which extend Kodi with a multitude of [[Plug-in (computing)|addons]], such as audio and video streaming plugins for online sources, screensavers, skins and themes, visualizations, weather forecasts, web interfaces, web scrapers, widget scripts, and more. Kodi developers encourage users to make and submit their own addons to expand media content and [[value-added service]]s accessible from within Kodi.\n\nKodi/XBMC features, since version 10.0 (codename: \"Dharma\"), an Addons Framework architecture and an Addons Manager GUI client that connects to a [[decentralized]] [[digital distribution]] service [[Platform (computing)|platform]] that serves add-on apps and [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] which among other things provide online content to Kodi, the \"Addons Manager\" (or \"Addons Browser\") inside Kodi allows users to browse and download new addons directly from Kodi's GUI.\n\nMany of these online content sources are in [[over-the-top content]] high definition services and use video streaming site as sources for the media content that is offered. Kodi has extensibility and integration with online sources for free and premium streaming content, and offers content from everything from commercial video to free educational programming, and media from individuals and small businesses. Not all content sources on add-ons are available in every country, however. Due to rights agreements, many content sources are geo-restricted to prevent users in outside countries from accessing content, although some have taken to bypassing the regional restrictions in order to unblock these sources, disregarding the usage rights.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wtvpc.com/unblock-kodi-tv-add-ons/ |title=How To Unblock Kodi TV Add-Ons {{!}} wTVPC |website=wtvpc.com |access-date=6 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912074402/http://wtvpc.com/unblock-kodi-tv-add-ons/ |archive-date=12 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Plugins and scripts====\nKodi features an integrated Python Scripts interpreter for addon extensions, and WindowXML [[application framework]] (a XML-based [[widget toolkit]] engine for creating a GUI for apps and [[widget (computing)|widgets]]) in a similar fashion to Apple macOS [[Dashboard (macOS)|Dashboard Widgets]] and [[Microsoft Gadgets]]. Python widget scripts allow normal users to add new functionality to Kodi themselves, using Python scripting language. Current [[plugins|plugin]] scripts include functions like [[Internet television|Internet-TV]] and [[trailer (film)|movie-trailer]] browsers, cinemaguides, weather forecast, [[over-the-top content]] video streaming services like YouTube, [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]], [[Veoh]], [[MLB.tv]], Internet-radio-station browsers such as Pandora Radio, online picture sharing sites like [[Flickr]], TV guides such as [[TVShow Time]], e-mail clients, [[instant messaging]], different timetables, [[home automation]] scripts to [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] control PVR software and hardware, [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file-sharing downloaders ([[BitTorrent]]), [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], also [[casual game]]s such as ''[[Tetris]]''.<ref name=\"XBMC is the best media center application. Period.\" /><ref name=\"XBMC 9.04 delivers impressive media center experience\" />\n\n====Metadata extraction and web scrapers====\nKodi has the built-in optional function to automatically download [[metadata]] information, [[cover art]] and other related media artwork online through its [[web scraping|web scrapers]] that looks for media in the user's audio and video folders and their sub-directories. These \"scrapers\" are used as [[Importer (computing)|importers]] to obtain detailed information from various Internet resources about movies and television shows. It can get synopses, reviews, movie posters, titles, genre classification, and other similar data. XBMCGUI then provides a rich display for audio and video files that the scrapers have identified.\n\nScrapers use sites like [[The Movie Database]] (TMDb) or [[IMDb.com]] to obtain [[thumbnails]] and information on movies, [[TheTVDB|thetvdb.com]] for TV show posters and episode plots, [[CDDB]] for audio CD track listings, and [[Allmusic|Allmusic (AMG)]] and [[MusicBrainz]] for album [[thumbnails]], reviews, and metadata.\n\nFanart.tv has been added to the list of information sources and XBMC can use it to retrieve logos, backgrounds, CDs with transparent backgrounds, album covers and banners among other image types for music artists, TV shows and movies, the popularity of which contributed to XBMC being able to handle new image types.\n\n===Skins and themes===\nLike the majority of applications that originated from a '[[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]]' scene, modification and customization of the interface using [[skin (computing)|skin]]s is very popular among Kodi users and hundreds of skins and themes are available for users to install. The Kodi skinning engine's flexibility is also advantageous to third parties wanting to create derivative works, as it facilitates rebranding the environment and making deeper changes to the look and feel of the user interface.\n\nAs of Kodi version 17, the official default skins for new installs are \"Estuary\", for typical [[Home theater PC|home-theater]] usage, and \"Estouchy\" for [[touchscreen]]s.  These newly designed skins replace the longtime default skin \"Confluence\", and are intended to present more content on the homescreen, be easier for new users, and bring \"Kodi into the present day of UI design.\"\n\nUsers can also create their own skin (or simply modify an existing skin) and share it with others via public websites that are used for Kodi skin trading and development. Many such third-party skins exist that are well maintained by the community, and while some skins are originals with unique designs, most begin as a clone or an exact replica of other multimedia software interfaces, such as [[Apple Front Row]], [[Windows XP Media Center Edition|Windows Media Center Edition]] (MCE), MediaPortal, [[Wii Menu|Wii Channel Menu (Xii)]], [[Xbox 360#Software|Xbox 360 interface]], and others.<ref name=\"Customize XBMC with These Five Awesome Skins\">{{Cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5198009/customize-xbmc-with-these-five-awesome-skins |title=Customize XBMC with These Five Awesome Skins |last=Jason Fitzpatrick |date=5 April 2009 |website=Lifehacker |access-date=15 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204125706/https://lifehacker.com/5198009/customize-xbmc-with-these-five-awesome-skins |archive-date=4 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to skins and themes users can create a themed package called a 'build'. Within this package homebrew developers are able to distribute a skin and multiple addons. The delivery mechanism used within the Kodi scene is called a wizard with the Replicant Wizard<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://replicant.run/signup |title=Replicant Wizard - Register}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> being the most prominent.\n\n===Web Interfaces===\nWeb Interface addons for Kodi normally allow browsing a media library remotely, to handle music playlists from a computer instead of television. Others allow remotely controlling the navigation of XBMC like a remote for [[Touchscreen remote control|remote controlling]] of an installed and concurrently active Kodi session running on a computer if it runs on an internet tablet or similar device with a touch interface. Others act like a media manager to allow modifying metadata and artwork in XBMC's video and music libraries.\n\n===Application launcher===\nKodi has a \"My Programs\" section which is meant to function as an application launcher for third-party [[application software|software]] such as computer games and [[List of emulators|video game emulator]]s, all from a [[GUI]] with [[thumbnail]] and different listings options. However, while this feature was fully functioning on the Xbox version of XBMC, it is still in its infant stage on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows, thus requiring third-party launcher plugins to function properly.<ref name=\"Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine\" />\n\n==Mobile remotes and second screen apps==\nThere are many software applications for mobile devices available for and associated with Kodi. Some of these mobile apps just works as simple remote controls, while others function as more advanced [[second screen]] companion apps, offering additional information about what users are viewing or listening to on Kodi, such as [[metadata]] about movie actors and music artists, with links to other works available from those persons in their collection or online.\n\n\"XBMC Remote for Android\" and \"XBMC Remote for iOS\" are free and open source official apps for mobile devices released by Team-Kodi/Team-XBMC on [[Google Play]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices and the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for [[iOS Devices]], such as [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod Touch]].

Some of these remote control apps are made specifically for controlling Kodi, while some universal remote control apps are capable of controlling many different media center and media player applications, and some of these third-party remote apps cost money while others are free.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5501010/enhance-your-xbmc-experience-with-remote-controls-for-any-device |title=Enhance Your XBMC Experience with Remote Controls for Any Device |date=24 March 2010 |publisher=Lifehacker.com |access-date=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024215108/http://lifehacker.com/5501010/enhance-your-xbmc-experience-with-remote-controls-for-any-device |archive-date=24 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Official versions==\nDue to the dated hardware of the first-generation Xbox game console that Kodi-XBMC was designed for, and a desire to expand the project's end-user and developer-base, many official [[porting|ports]] of XBMC to computer operating-systems and hardware platforms have been created. Through the processing power of more recent computer hardware, XBMC can decode [[high-definition video]] up to and beyond [[1080p]] resolutions, bypassing hardware limitations of the Xbox version of XBMC.\n\nIn recent releases of Kodi-XBMC there is [[Video Acceleration API|hardware accelerated video decoding]] for [[DXVA]], [[VDPAU]], [[VA-API]] GPU hardware video decoding, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via [[ARM NEON]], and [[OpenMAX]], Broadcom Crystal HD.<ref name=\"XBMC 9.04 delivers impressive media center experience\" /><ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3701 |title=XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs |last=Anand Lal Shimpi |date=29 December 2009 |website=AnandTech |access-date=20 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122122537/http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc.aspx?i=3701 |archive-date=22 January 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The source code for XBMC is actively updated by developers in a public [[Git (software)|Git repository]], which may contain features and functionality not yet incorporated into the most recent \"stable\" releases.\n\n===Kodibuntu===\nKodibuntu (formerly ''XBMCbuntu'') was a free [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based [[Linux distribution]] with Kodi (formerly ''XBMC'') for Linux already installed and pre-configured, providing a complete packaged media center software suite for all IA-32/x86-based personal computers. Kodibuntu uses Kodi software for all media playback and is primarily designed for [[Just enough operating system|bare-metal installation]]s to achieve [[instant-on]] type [[Booting|boot]] to achieve a set-top box experience on an HTPC. It replaced XBMCbuntu which in turn replaced XBMC Live, the former official [[Live CD]] (Linux) distribution.\n\nKodibuntu was based on [[Lubuntu]], an Ubuntu Linux fork that was \"lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient\" than the standard Ubuntu desktop distributions. The [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] Remote and IR-receiver dongle works directly with Kodibuntu out of the box, which means  Windows Media Center users with these common peripherals can use Kodibuntu without requiring any additional hardware.\n\nFollowing the principles of [[MythTV#Operating system bundles|MythTV distributions]] and [[GeeXboX]], Kodibuntu is designed to simplify the permanent installation of Kodi onto a computer for use as a dedicated home theater PC. The user can directly install XBMC from the bootable CD onto a USB flash drive or internal hard disk drive, since it comes with a complete instant-on ([[Linux kernel]]-based) [[embedded operating system]]. When installed on a USB flash drive or internal hard disk drive, Kodibuntu can save settings and make updates to XBMC and the operating system back to that drive.\n\n===Native applications===\n''Kodi for Linux'' (formerly ''XBMC for Linux'') is primarily developed for Ubuntu Linux and Kodi's developers' own Kodibuntu (formerly ''XBMCbuntu''). Third-party packages for most other Linux distributions are also available, and it is possible to compile XBMC Media Center from scratch for any Linux distribution, as long as the required dependency libraries are installed first. Hardware accelerated video decoding is achieved via the [[VDPAU]] API on Nvidia's GPUs, the [[VAAPI]] API for [[AMD Radeon|AMD/ATI Radeon]], [[S3 Graphics]], and Intel's newer [[Integrated Graphics Processor]]s, as well as hardware accelerated video decoding via [[OpenMAX]], [[ARM NEON]], and Broadcom Crystal HD on systems with supporting hardware.<ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\" /> Development version of Kodi/XBMC for Linux is available at [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]] as [[Personal Package Archive|PPA (Personal Package Archive)]] for the standard Ubuntu Desktop version 8.04 and later, as well as [[deb (file format)|DEB packages]] for [[Debian]].\n\n''Kodi for OS X''(formerly ''XBMC for Mac'') runs natively on {{nowrap|Mac OS X Tiger}} and later, as well as on the Apple TV. 1080p playback can be achieved on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers either via software decoding on the CPU, if it is powerful enough, or by hardware-accelerated video decoding for hardware supporting Apple's VDA API or video decoders such as the Broadcom Crystal HD.<ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\" />\n\n1080p playback on the first-generation Apple TV (a.k.a. \"ATV1\") can only be achieved by hardware accelerated video decoding via Broadcom Crystal HD; the user must replace the ATV's internal WiFi adapter with a Broadcom Crystal HD [[PCI Express Mini Card|PCI Express Mini (mini-PCIe) card]] in order to activate this functionality.<ref name=\"XBMC & Broadcom Bring 1080p Decode Upgrade to ill-equipped netbooks, nettops, Apple TVs\" />\n\n''Kodi for Windows'' (formerly ''XBMC for Windows'') runs natively on Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 as a [[32-bit]] or [[64-bit]] application. 1080p and Ultra HD (4K) playback can be achieved on Windows computers either via software decoding on the CPU, if it's powerful enough, or by hardware accelerated video decoding.\n\nHardware video decoding via [[DirectX Video Acceleration]] is supported, although this enhancement only runs on Windows 7 (or later?) since it uses the DXVA 2.0 API, which was not supported in Windows XP.\n\n''Kodi for iOS'' (formerly ''XBMC for iOS''), a full port of Kodi to Apple's iOS operating-system, was released publicly on 20 January 2011. It supported both 720p and 1080p hardware accelerated video decoding of [[H.264]] videos, and was compatible with Apple's iDevices that use [[Apple A4]] or [[Apple A5]] (ARM-based) processors with a jailbroken iOS operating-system.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/01/xbmc-on-appletv-ios-jailbreak |title=XBMC now running on jailbroken Apple TV or iDevice |last=Foresman |first=Chris |date=21 January 2011 |publisher=Arstechnica.com |access-date=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2017 [https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/iosapps/how-install-kodi-on-iphone-or-ipad-without-jailbreaking-3634908/ MacWorld UK described] how to install on iOS devices before iOS 11 without jailbreak.\n\n''Kodi for Android'' (formerly ''XBMC for Android'') is a full port of the complete Kodi/XBMC application to Google's Android operating-system, officially compatible with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later versions supporting [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|API Level 14]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.html |title=Android 4.0 APIs |access-date=3 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329115550/http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0.html |archive-date=29 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> was first announced and its source code released publicly on 13 June 2012.

This is also the real reason why XBMC for Android does not support the original [[Google TV]]; since the Android NDK was not made available for older Google TV devices it means that Kodi/XBMC could not be compiled for it today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://spurint.org/journal/2012/10/google-tv-and-native-libraries/ |title=Google TV and Native Libraries |publisher=Spurint.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106032747/http://spurint.org/journal/2012/10/google-tv-and-native-libraries/ |archive-date=6 January 2013 |access-date=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Xbox (first-generation)===\n{{Main|XBMC4Xbox}}\nXBMC 9.04 (codename: ''Babylon'') point-release version of XBMC for Xbox, now obsolete, was released on 6 May 2009 as the last official version of XBMC for Xbox. The original developers of XBMC have since issued a statement stating they will no longer develop or support XBMC for Xbox as part of the XBMC project as of 27 May 2010. The development of XBMC for Xbox ended because the focus for all Team XBMC developers has completely shifted to the Linux, Mac, and Windows versions of XBMC instead.\n\nEven though the original XBMC project no longer develops or supports XBMC for the Xbox, an XBMC version for the Xbox is still available via the third-party developer spin-off project \"[[XBMC4Xbox]]\", who have completely taken over the development and support of XBMC for the original Xbox.<ref name=\"XBMC Discontinues Xbox Support\" /><ref name=\"XBMC Drops Support for the Original Xbox\" /><ref name=\"XBMC4Xbox\" />\n\nXBMC for Xbox was never an authorized/signed Microsoft product, therefore a [[Xbox modding|modification of the Xbox]] is required in order to run XBMC on an Xbox game-console. XBMC for Xbox can be run as an application (like any Xbox game), or as a [[Xbox Dashboard|dashboard]] that appears directly when the Xbox is turned on.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" /><ref name=\"Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine\" /> Since XBMC for Xbox was part of an open source software program, its development [[source code]] was stored on a publicly accessible [[subversion (software)|subversion repository]]. Accordingly, unofficial [[executable]] builds from the subversion repository are often released by third parties on sites unaffiliated with the official XBMC project.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" /><ref name=\"Review of XBMC in Hardcore Gamer Magazine\" />\n\n===Xbox One===\nOn 29 December 2017, Kodi developers announced via the news section of their official website that a Kodi app had been released for the [[Xbox One]]. It is noted that the [[Universal Windows Platform|UWP]] version will retain the characteristic Kodi appearance, however, many core features are missing or broken.\n\n==Commercial systems==\n{{list spam|section|date=April 2017}}\nThe developers of Kodi (formerly ''XBMC'') state that as long as the GPL licensing of the Kodi software is respected they would love Kodi to run on as many third-party hardware platforms and [[operating system]]s as possible, as \"'''Powered by Kodi'''\" (or \"'''Powered by XBMC'''\") branded devices and systems. They envision Kodi being pre-installed as a [[third-party software component]] that commercial and non-commercial [[Original design manufacturer|ODM]]s and [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s and [[systems integrator]] companies can use [[royalty-free]] on their own hardware, hardware such as [[set-top box]]es from [[Television station|cable-TV companies]], [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[Video game console|game-consoles]], or [[Embedded system|embedded computers]] and [[System-on-a-chip|SoC (System-on-a-Chip)]] built into [[television set]]s for web-enabled TVs, and other entertainment devices for the living room entertainment system, [[home cinema]], or similar uses.\n\nBelow is a list of third-party companies that sell hardware bundled with Kodi or XBMC software pre-installed, or sell uninstalled systems that specifically claim to be Kodi- or XBMC-compatible. Many of these third-party companies help submit bug fixes and new features back upstream to the original Kodi-XBMC project.\n\n===Computer hardware===\n[[ARCTIC]] is a company based in Switzerland best known for their [[Computer cooling|cooling solutions]] worked in [[partnership]] with the [[OpenELEC]] team.

This project was created as a fork of XBMC as a separate project to continue having a version of XBMC for the Xbox hardware platform. It was not started by official members of the official XBMC project, nor will it be supported by the official Team Kodi in any way. It started when support for the Xbox branch was officially dropped by Team XBMC, which was announced on 27 May 2010.\n\n==Programming and developing==\nKodi is a non-profit and [[free software community]] driven [[open-source software]] project that is developed only by volunteers in their [[spare time]] without any [[monetary]] gain. XBMC Foundation and the team of developers leading the development of Kodi/XBMC, \"''Team-Kodi''\"/\"''Team-XBMC''\", encourage anyone and everyone to submit their own [[patch (computing)|source code patches]] for new features and functions, improve existing ones, or fix [[software bug|bugs]] to the Kodi/XBMC project.\n\nThe online [[user guide|user manual]] is [[wiki]]-based and community driven, and it also works as a basic developers' guide for getting a good overview of Kodi's architecture. However, as with most non-profit software projects, to delve deeper into programming, looking at the actual source code and the [[Doxygen]] formatted \"code documentation\" comments inside that code is needed.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:XBMC Architecture Overview Schematic.png|thumb|250px|XBMC architecture overview schematic]]\nKodi is a cross-platform software application whose core is mainly programmed in {{nowrap|[[C++]]}}. Kodi uses [[OpenGL]] (or [[OpenGL ES]]) graphics [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] under Kodi for both Linux and macOS, while Kodi for Windows uses [[DirectX|Microsoft DirectX]] multimedia framework and [[Direct3D]] rendering, as the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version of XBMC did. Some of Kodi's own [[library (computing)|libraries]], as well as many third-party libraries that Kodi depends on, are written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming-language]], instead of {{nowrap|C++}} as Kodi's core, but they are then mostly used with a {{nowrap|C++}} wrapper and, through Kodi's core monolithic nature, are loaded via a [[dynamic linker]] [[Loader (computing)|loader]] for on-demand loading and unloading at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].<ref name=\"XBMC 9.04 delivers impressive media center experience\" /> Kodi also still partially uses the SDL ([[Simple DirectMedia Layer]]) multimedia [[Software framework|framework]] for input on Linux, but its developers are working on completely removing that small remaining dependency on SDL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://codedocs.xyz/CodeDocs/xbmc/modules.html |title=Kodi Documentation: Modules |website=CodeDocs.xyz |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152308/https://codedocs.xyz/CodeDocs/xbmc/modules.html |archive-date=30 August 2017 |access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause of Kodi/XBMC's origin with the resource constraints on the hardware and environment of the first-generation Xbox game-console platform, all software development of Kodi/XBMC has always been focused on reserving the limited resources that existed on embedded system hardware, like the original Xbox (which was only a 733&nbsp;MHz [[Intel Pentium III]] and 64&nbsp;MB of RAM in total as [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]]), as well as the still relatively low resources of [[embedded system]] devices today, of which the main hindrance has always been the amount of available system [[random access memory|RAM]] and graphics memory at any one time. This means that Kodi/XBMC is purposely programmed to be very resource- and power-efficient and can therefore run on very low-end and relatively non-expensive hardware, especially when compared to other media center software design for HTPC use.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\nBut because of its origins from the Xbox game-console, Kodi/XBMC's legacy [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics renderer]] still runs in a more game-loop rendering environment rather than using a fully event-driven and on-demand rendering, meaning that it is almost constantly re-drawing the GUI and refreshing the frames as fast as it can, even when nothing is changing on the screen. This results in very high CPU and high GPU usage, which can be observed on embedded systems and low-end machines, and hence cause high temperatures, high fan activity, and high power consumption unless capped at a maximum frame per second configuration for that specific platform build. Work is however constantly ongoing by the developers to make Kodi/XBMC run using much fewer resources on low-power and embedded systems, which will indirectly benefit all non-embedded systems as well. Efficiency improvements in this area are however being worked on in order to move away from that old style game-loop environment in order to reduce high CPU/GPU usage by the GUI, especially as XBMC usage on embedded platforms with limited CPU/GPU resources keeps growing in popularity. XBMC 11.0 (Eden) introduced Dirty-Regions rendering option for texture support to the XBMC skinning engine as an option, and XBMC 12.0 (Frodo) enabled Dirty Regions rendering to redraw the whole screen on a single dirty region by default on all platforms. Work is also in progress for XBMC 14.0 to introduce an abstracted scene-graph deferred rendering for GUI renderer abstraction.\n\n====Portability====\nKodi has a [[Software portability|portable code base]], with its [[Trunk (software)|trunk (mainline source code tree)]] officially available for [[IA-32]]/[[x86]], [[x86-64]], [[PowerPC]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based platforms.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tegradeveloper.nvidia.com/tegra/project/xbmc |title=XBMC on NVIDIA Tegra |website=Tegradeveloper.Nvidia.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100112142539/http://tegradeveloper.nvidia.com/tegra/project/xbmc |archive-date=12 January 2010 |access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>http://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010_Projects/XBMC {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923042204/http://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010_Projects/XBMC |date=23 September 2010 }} BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010 Projects/XBMC</ref> The Kodi GUI does require 3D hardware accelerated graphics ([[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]) that support [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenGL]], or [[EGL (OpenGL)|EGL]], or [[Direct3D]] with device drivers that support [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0, or OpenGL 1.3 or later with [[GLSL]], or [[DirectX]] in order to [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the GUI at an acceptable [[frame rate]].\n\nKodi is thus officially not yet available for [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] upstream in mainline source code repository from Team-Kodi, nor does it as yet support [[DirectFB]] or [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure)]] rendering without OpenGL/GLES hardware accelerated graphics support.<ref name=\"XBMC ARM port teased, will manage HD playback from pocket-sized Beagleboard (video)\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/02/xbmc-arm-port-teased-will-manage-hd-playback-from-pocket-sized/ |title=XBMC ARM port teased, will manage HD playback from pocket-sized Beagleboard (video) |last=Tim Stevens |date=2 November 2009 |website=Engadget |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519200536/https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/02/xbmc-arm-port-teased-will-manage-hd-playback-from-pocket-sized/ |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The combination of MIPS, DirectFB, and DRI is a popular architecture used today by simpler [[set-top box]]es like digital broadcasting (cable/satellite) boxes and low-end [[digital media player]]s, such as those based on [[MIPS architecture]] chipsets from [[Sigma Designs]] or [[Realtek]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iboum.com/artkill/chipsets.php |title=Media Player Chipsets |publisher=Iboum.com |access-date=24 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123135059/http://www.iboum.com/artkill/chipsets.php |archive-date=23 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kodi ports to MIPS is, however, currently being actively worked on by several independent development teams.\n\nKodi for Linux supports [[toolchain]] building systems for embedded development such as [[Yocto Project|Yocto]], [[Buildroot]] ([[uClibc]]), and the [[Linaro]] set of Makefiles and patches for easing the generation of [[Cross compiler|cross-compilation]] toolchains as well as the creation of a file system on [[embedded Linux]] systems across a wide range of hardware, kernel platforms, and CPU architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.).\n\n===Python scripts as plugins and addons (widgets and gadgets)===\nKodi allows developers to create addons using a built-in [[Python (programming language)|Python interpreter]] (version 2.6 or higher depending on system) and its own WindowXML [[application framework]], which together form an XML-based widget toolkit for which they can extend the capability of Kodi by creating a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] for [[GUI widget|widgets]].

Xbox Media Player development stopped on 13 December 2003, by which time its successor was ready for its debut, renamed as it was growing out of its 'player' name and into a 'center' for media playback. The first stable release of XBMC was on 29 June 2004, with the official release of XboxMediaCenter 1.0.0. This announcement also encouraged everyone using XBMP or XBMC Beta release to update, as all support for those previous versions would be dropped, and they would only support version 1.0.0. Not featured in XBMP, the addition of embedded [[Python (programming language)|Python]] was given the ability to draw interface elements in the GUI, and allowed user and community generated scripts to be executed within the XBMC environment.<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\nWith the release of 1.0.0 in the middle of 2004, work continued on the XBMC project to add more features, such as support for iTunes features like DAAP and Smart Playlists, as well as lots of improvements and fixes. The second stable release of XBMC, 1.1.0, was released on 18 October 2004. This release included support for more media types, file types, container formats, as well as video playback of Nullsoft streaming videos and karaoke support (CD-G).<ref name=\"Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center\" />\n\nAfter two years of heavy development, XBMC announced a stable point final release of XBMC 2.0.0 on 29 September 2006. Even more features were packed into the new version with the addition of RAR and zip archive support, a brand new player interface with support for multiple players. Such players include PAPlayer, the new audio/music player with crossfade, gapless playback and ReplayGain support, and the new DVDPlayer with support for menu and navigation support as well as ISO/img image parsing. Prior to this point release, XBMC just used a modified fork of [[MPlayer]] for all of its media needs, so this was a big step forward. Support for iTunes 6.x DAAP, and Upnp Clients for streaming was also added. A reworked Skinning Engine was included in this release to provide a more powerful way to change the appearance of XBMC. The last two features include read-only support for FAT12/16/32 formatted [[USB mass storage]] devices, and a \"skinnable\" 3D visualizer.\n\nThe release of XBMC 2.0.1 on 12 November 2006 contained numerous fixes for bugs that made it through the 2.0.0 release. This also marked the change from CVS to SVN (Subversion) for the development tree.\n\nOn 29 May 2007, the team behind XBMC put out a call for developers interested in porting XBMC to the Linux operating system. A few developers on Team-XBMC had already begun porting parts of XBMC over to Linux using SDL and OpenGL as a replacement for DirectX, which XBMC was using heavily on the Xbox version of XBMC.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/10/history-of-boxee-and-boxee-was-born-slowly/ |title=History Of Boxee: And Boxee Was Born, Slowly |date=19 October 2010 |website=Gizmodo.com.au |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830145826/https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/10/history-of-boxee-and-boxee-was-born-slowly/ |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/tags/history-of-boxee/ |title=Gizmodo Australia - the Gadget Guide - Technology and consumer electronics news and reviews |website=www.Gizmodo.com.au |access-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152106/https://www.gizmodo.com.au/tags/history-of-boxee/ |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment on the Git codebase is continuing and the versioning scheme has been changed to reflect the release year and month, e.g., 8.10, 9.04, 9.11, 10.05.\n\nOn 27 May 2010, the team behind XBMC announced the splitting of the Xbox branch into a new project; \"XBMC4Xbox\" which will continue the development and support of XBMC for the old Xbox hardware platform as a separate project, with the original XBMC project no longer offering any support for the Xbox.<ref name=\"XBMC Discontinues Xbox Support\" /><ref name=\"XBMC Drops Support for the Original Xbox\" /><ref name=\"XBMC4Xbox\" />\n\nOn 2 January 2011, XBMC moved the source code repository from [[subversion (software)|subversion]] to [[Git (software)|git]], hosted at [[GitHub]].\n\nOn 1 August 2014, an announcement was made of release 14 and name change to Kodi.\n\n== Organization and licensing ==\nThe XBMC Foundation is the organization behind the Kodi and XBMC projects.

{"title_page": "Electronic signage", "text_new": "'''Electronic signage''' (also called '''electronic signs''' or '''electronic displays''') are [[Lighting|illuminant]] [[advertising media]] in the [[signage]] industry. Major electronic signage include [[fluorescent]] signs, HID ([[High-intensity discharge lamp|high intensity]] displays), [[Incandescent lamp|incandescent]] signs, [[LED display|LED signs]], and [[neon sign]]s. Besides, LED signs and HID are so-called [[digital signage]].\n\n==Status==\nElectronic signs may be used indoors or outdoors. The display technologies are varied and changing quickly. Because of new display technologies, electronic signs are able to present more clear, colorful, and vivid images. Animated electronic signs gradually replace traditional static signs and increasingly take signage market share.\n\n=== Average percentage of various signs usage<ref>[http://www.signweb.com Signs of the Times]</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|'''Type of Signage'''\n|'''2001'''\n|'''2002'''\n|'''2003'''\n|-\n| Fluorescent\n| 47.3%\n| 46.9%\n| 46.3%\n|-\n| HID (High Intensity Display)\n| 1.9%\n| 2.4%\n| 2.0%\n|-\n| Incandescent\n| 2.0%\n| 1.9%\n| 1.8%\n|-\n| [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]\n| 3.9%\n| 6.2%\n| 7.2%\n|-\n| [[Neon]]\n| 43.0%\n| 41.3%\n| 41.7%\n|-\n| Others\n| 1.9%\n| 1.2%\n| 0.9%\n|}\n\n==Regulation (USA)==\n{{Globalize\n|date=May 2011\n| 1= section\n| 2= USA|2name=the United States}}\nIt is not difficult to have an electronic sign for your business; however, it is not simple to get a permit to install an electronic sign.

The word \"Malankara\" is a combination of two words, 'Mala' which means mountains and 'Kara' which means land surface; and refers to the modern-day state of [[Kerala]] in India. This land had a historical trade connection with the [[Middle East]] nations from the ancient era and the traders from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], and the [[Levant]] frequently visited this land for getting [[Spice|spices]]. These groups included Arabs, Jews and also Christians, and the Christians who visited here maintained contact with the Malankara Church. As such the Church in Malankara was in touch with other Eastern churches such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Church of the East|Persian churches]]. The Malankara Church was headed by the 'Malankara Moopan' (also Malankara Metropolitan) who is the successor of Thomas the Apostle and also the heir of the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas in Malankara. \nThe Malankara Church was unique and unanimous till the 16th century and later some rifts happened due to the colonization of the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] Portuguese [[padroado]] missionaries. A group of people split off from the church in 1663 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar]] who joined with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; this split caused to the emergence of the first [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Church]] (modern-day [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Church]]) in Malankara. The people who stood with the Malankara Moopan remained independent as Malankara Nasranis. With the arrival of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa]] in 1665 from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], he was able to re-establish ties between the Malankara Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. And adopt over the [[Malankara Rite|Malankara Rite liturgy]] from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] [[liturgical rite]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church. \n\nLater a number of splits happened in Malankara Church due to the influence of foreign missionaries and internal conflicts. In the year 1772 a Syriac Orthodox bishop consecrated Kattumangatt Kurien (Mar Cyril) as his successor against the wishes of the Metropolitan, [[Mar Dionysius I]]; Cyril led a faction that eventually became the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]].<ref name=Neill70>Neill 2002, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara92>Vadakkekara, p. 92.</ref> In the 19th century, a reform movement inspired by British missionaries led to the formation of the independent [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], while the rest of the church, resistant to British influence, came under the direct jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1876.<ref name=Gregorios285/> In 1911,  a dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch made a factional conflict in the Malankara Church and it made two factions in the church namely Bavakakshi, the People who support the Patriarch of Antioch and Methrankakshi, the people who support Malankara Metropolitan. This conflict led to a century lasting internal conflicts and litigation in the church . The Apex Court of India  passed  a remarkable judgement on Malankara Church dispute on 3rd July 2017 and this put an end to  all the internal conflicts\nin the Malankara Church.\n\n==Terminology==\nInitially the terms \"[[Malankara Christians]]\" or \"Malankara Nasranis\" were applied to all Saint Thomas Christians,<ref>Frykenberg, p. 109.</ref> but following the split the term was generally restricted to the faction loyal to [[Mar Thoma I]] the then Malankara Metropolitan, and distinguishing them from the Roman Catholic faction.<ref name=Frykenberg136>Frykenberg, p. 136.</ref> Later, many of the churches that subsequently branched off have maintained the word in their names. At the time of the split, the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\", while the branch that entered into Catholic obedience was designated the ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\". The Portuguese Roman Catholics were not in familiar with the traditions of Eastern Christianity . In the view of Portuguese Missioneries the Nasranis who practice the Rituals of Eastern Christianity are new traditionals and there for they called the Malankara Nazranis ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\" and they called themselves as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\".  Following the association with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the church was often known as the Malankara Syrian Church (Malayalam: \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d30 \u0d38\u0d41\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d38\u0d2d) in reference to their connection to the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac tradition]].\n\n==Early history of Christianity in India==\n[[File:SaintThomasChristian'sDivisionsHistoryFinal-en.svg|alt=|thumb|265x265px|Saint Thomas Christians - Divisions- History in a nutshell]]\nAs a Saint Thomas Christian group, the Malankara Church traced its origins to [[Thomas the Apostle]], said to have proselytized in India in the 1st century.<ref name=Gregorios285/> Different strains of the tradition have him arriving either by sea<ref name=\"T.K.

From the early 4th century the [[Patriarch of the Church of the East]] provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch [[Ishoyahb III]] solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.<ref>Baum & Winkler, p. 53.</ref> In the 8th century Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] organised the community as the [[India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of India]], one of the church's illustrious Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a [[metropolitan bishop]], provided from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\".<ref name=Baum52/> His [[metropolitan see]] was probably in [[Cranganore]], or (perhaps nominally) in [[Mylapore]], where the shrine of Thomas was located.<ref name=Baum52/> Under him were a varying number of [[bishops]], as well as a native [[Archdeacon]], who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.<ref name=Baum52/>\n\n===Cheppeds: Collection of deeds on copper plates===\nThe Rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation for their assistance, gave to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates.

Though technically subordinate to the metropolitan, the archdeacon wielded great ecclesiastical and secular power, to the extent that he was considered the secular leader of the community and served as effective head of the Indian Church in times when the province was absent a bishop. Unlike the metropolitan, who was evidently always an East Syriac sent by the patriarch, the archdeacon was a native Saint Thomas Christian. In the documented period the position was evidently hereditary, belonging to the [[Pakalomattam]] family, who claimed a privileged connection to Thomas the Apostle.<ref name=Baum52/><ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nDetails on the archidiaconate prior to the arrival of the Portuguese are elusive, but Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780 \u2013 823) called the Archdeacon of India the \"head of the faithful in India\", implying an elevated status by at least that time.<ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271.</ref> In the recorded period of its history, the office of archdeacon was substantially different in India than in the rest of the Church of the East or other Christian churches. In the broader Church of the East, each bishop was attended by an archdeacon, but in India, there was only ever one archdeacon, even when the province had multiple bishops serving it.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 272.</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.<ref name=\"Baum105\">Baum & Winkler, p. 105.</ref> In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope of Alexandria]] and to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East [[Shem'on IV Basidi|Shem\u02bfon IV Basidi]] responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India.<ref name=Baum105/> These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Malankara community.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 274.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Portuguese==\n{{See also|Portuguese India}}\nAt the time the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a difficult position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the [[spice trade]] and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community under pressure from the forces of the powerful [[raja]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community greeted them and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 122\u2013124.</ref> The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought to India a particularly militant brand of Christianity, the product of several centuries of struggle during the [[Reconquista]], which they hoped to spread across the world.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 127.</ref> Facilitating this objective was the ''[[Padroado Real]]'', a series of treaties and decrees in which the [[Pope]] conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in [[Goa]] and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment felt it necessary to conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the [[Latin Rite]], both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the [[Archbishop of Goa]].\n\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more aggressive in their efforts to subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 130.</ref> Protests on the part of the natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a [[Schism of 1552|schism in the Church of the East]] resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]], and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else convert them to Latin Rite Catholicism outright.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 130\u2013133.</ref> In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 134.</ref>\n\nBy 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]], had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.<ref>Neill 2004, pp. 208\u2013210.</ref> That year Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]], which instituted a number of structural and liturgical reforms to the Indian church. At the synod, the parishes were brought directly under the Archbishop's authority, certain \"superstitious\" customs were anathematized, and the traditional variant of the [[East Syriac Rite]], was purged of elements unacceptable by the Latin standards.<ref>Neill 2004, p. 214.</ref> Though the Saint Thomas Christians were now formally part of the Catholic Church, the conduct of the Portuguese over the next decades fueled resentment in parts of the community, ultimately leading to open resistance.<ref name=\"Frykenberg136\"/>\n\n==Coonan Cross and the independent church==\n{{See also|Coonan Cross Oath}}\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Latin prelates and what remained of the native hierarchy. This came to a head in 1641 with the ascension of two new protagonists on either side of the contention: Francis Garcia, the new Archbishop of Kodungalloor, and Archdeacon [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George.<ref name=\"Frykenberg367\">Frykenberg, p. 367.</ref> In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the arrival in India of a mysterious figure named [[Ahatallah]].<ref name=Frykenberg367/><ref>Neill 2004, p. 316.</ref>\n\nAhatallah arrived in [[Mylapore]] in 1652, claiming to be the rightful [[Patriarch of Antioch]] who had been sent by the Catholic pope to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\".<ref name=\"Neill317\">Neill 2004, p. 317.</ref> Ahatallah's true biography is obscure, but some details have been established. He appears to have been a [[Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop of Damascus who converted to Catholicism and went to Rome in 1632. He then returned to Syria in order to bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Hidayat Allah]] into communion with Rome. He had not accomplished this by the time Hidayat Allah died in 1639, after which point Ahatallah began claiming he was Hidayat Allah's rightful successor. In 1646 he was in [[Egypt]] at the court of the [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Mark VI of Alexandria|Mark VI]], who dispatched him to India in 1652, evidently in response to a request for aid from Archdeacon Thomas. Reckoning him an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him, but allowed him to meet with members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy, whom he impressed greatly. The Portuguese put him on a ship bound for Cochin and Goa, and Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin demanding to meet with the Patriarch. The Portuguese refused, asserting that he was a dangerous invader and that the ship had already sailed on to Goa.<ref name=Neill317/>\n\nAhatallah was never heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had disposed of him before he ever reached Goa.<ref name=\"Neill319\">Neill 2004, p. 319.</ref> Contemporary accounts allege that he was drowned in Cochin harbour, or even that the Portuguese burned him at the stake.<ref name=Neill319/><ref>Frykenberg, p. 368.</ref> In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in [[Paris]] before reaching Rome where his case was to be heard.<ref name=Neill319/> In any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\nThis was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and representatives of the community met at the Church of Our Lady in [[Mattancherry]] to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd.<ref name=Neill319/> The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] (Malayalam: ''\u0d15\u0d42\u0d28\u0d7b \u0d15\u0d41\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d36\u0d41 \u0d38\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02''), after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\n==Later development==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|360px|The first saint of India Malankara church [[Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala]] ]]\n[[File:Mar Thoma III.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Mar Thoma III]], 3rd Malankara Metropolitan]]\n\nThe oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community.  The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam ([[Coonan Cross Oath]]). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the [[St. Thomas Christians]] publicly took an oath in [[Mattancherry]], Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the [[Jesuit]] missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the [[Roman Catholic Pope]]. Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name [[Mar Thoma I]]. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including [[Parambil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar]] and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar.Episcopal consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]].Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syriac Catholics This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the ''Pazhayakoottukar'', or \"Old Party\", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puthankoottukar'', or \"New Party\".<ref name=\"Vadakkekara86\" /><ref name=\"Frykenberg, p. 361\"/><ref name=\"Fernando, p. 79\"/><ref name=\"Chaput, pp. 7\u20138\"/> These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.<ref name=\"Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note\"/>\n\n[[Mar Thoma I]] with 44 churches(out of 69 total churches)and their congregations were the body from which the [[Malankara Syrian Church]]es ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]], [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] originated. The Catholic faction constantly challenged the legitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan .This made it essential to rectify the illegitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan. In 1665, [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the Saint Thomas Christians under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"Geddes\">Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; [[Michael Geddes]], 1694;</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] regularised the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan as per the apostolic standards of Kaiveppu (traditional legitimate way of laying hands by a valid Bishop). This resulted in the spiritual relationship the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and the reaffirmation of the orthodox faith in the Church. The 18th century saw the gradual introduction of West Syriac liturgy and script to the Malabar Coast, a process that continued through the 19th century.\n\nThe arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665, marked the introduction of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in the Malankara Church.\n\nIn 1912, a Catholicate was instituted in Malankara by the Syriac orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]], thereby starting a century of legal proceedings between factions of the church which supported the Catholicate, and those who opposed it on behalf of the claims that, the [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]] was excommunicated.\n\nThe Malankara Church experienced a series of splits over the centuries, resulting in the formation of several churches, some of which embraced the jurisdiction of foreign churches, while others remained autocephalous and autonomous churches.\n\nThe churches that share the Malankara Church tradition are:\n#[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous oriental orthodox church.<ref>http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=9&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1</ref> Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] entroned on the apostolic throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] is the primate of the church.\n#[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]: an autonomous oriental orthodox church under the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]].\n#[[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]: an Independent and autonomous Malankara church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan\n#[[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]: a [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion.\n#[[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous church under the jurisdiction of its own independent Metropolitan.\n\n==See also==\n<!---only for articles not mentioned above--->\n*'''Pazhaya Seminary''' [[Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam]]\n* [[Malankara Metropolitan]]\n* [[List of Malankara Metropolitans]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1= Chaput|first1= Pascale|year= 1999 |title= La Double identit\u00e9 des chr\u00e9tiens keralais : confessions et castes chr\u00e9tiennes au Kerala (Inde du Sud) / The Double Identity of Kerala Christians: Confessions and Christian Castes (South India)|journal= Archives des sciences sociales des religions|publisher= |volume= 106|issue= |pages= 5\u201323|url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1999_num_106_1_1084#|doi= }}\n* Fernando, Leonard; Gispert-Sauch, G.

The word \"Malankara\" is a combination of two words, 'Mala' which means mountains and 'Kara' which means land surface; and refers to the modern-day state of [[Kerala]] in India. This land had a historical trade connection with the [[Middle East]] nations from the ancient era and the traders from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]], and the [[Levant]] frequently visited this land for getting [[Spice|spices]]. These groups included Arabs, Jews and also Christians, and the Christians who visited here maintained contact with the Malankara Church. As such the Church in Malankara was in touch with other Eastern churches such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Church of the East|Persian churches]]. The Malankara Church was headed by the 'Malankara Moopan' (also Malankara Metropolitan) who is the successor of Thomas the Apostle and also the heir of the Apostolic Throne of St Thomas in Malankara. \nThe Malankara Church was unique and unanimous till the 16th century and later some rifts happened due to the colonization of the [[Latin Church|Latin Catholic]] Portuguese [[padroado]] missionaries. A group of people split off from the church in 1663 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar]] who joined with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; this split caused to the emergence of the first [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniate Church]] (modern-day [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar Church]]) in Malankara. The people who stood with the Malankara Moopan remained independent as Malankara Nasranis. With the arrival of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Mar Gregorios Abdal Jaleel Bawa]] in 1665 from the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch]], he was able to re-establish ties between the Malankara Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. And adopt over the [[Malankara Rite|Malankara Rite liturgy]] from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] [[liturgical rite]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church. \n\nLater a number of splits happened in Malankara Church due to the influence of foreign missionaries and internal conflicts. In the year 1772 a Syriac Orthodox bishop consecrated Kattumangatt Kurien (Mar Cyril) as his successor against the wishes of the Metropolitan, [[Mar Dionysius I]]; Cyril led a faction that eventually became the [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]].<ref name=Neill70>Neill 2002, p. 70.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara92>Vadakkekara, p. 92.</ref> In the 19th century, a reform movement inspired by British missionaries led to the formation of the independent [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], while the rest of the church, resistant to British influence, came under the direct jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in 1876.<ref name=Gregorios285/> In 1911,  a dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch made a factional conflict in the Malankara Church and it made two factions in the church namely Bavakakshi, the People who support the Patriarch of Antioch and Methrankakshi, the people who support Malankara Metropolitan. This conflict led to a century lasting internal conflicts and litigation in the church . The Apex Court of India  passed  a remarkable judgement on Malankara Church dispute on 3rd July 2017 and this put an end to  all the internal conflicts\nin the Malankara Church.\n\n==Terminology==\nInitially the terms \"[[Malankara Christians]]\" or \"Malankara Nasranis\" were applied to all Saint Thomas Christians,<ref>Frykenberg, p. 109.</ref> but following the split the term was generally restricted to the faction loyal to [[Mar Thoma I]] the then Malankara Metropolitan, and distinguishing them from the Roman Catholic faction.<ref name=Frykenberg136>Frykenberg, p. 136.</ref> Later, many of the churches that subsequently branched off have maintained the word in their names. At the time of the split, the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\", while the branch that entered into Catholic obedience was designated the ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\". The Portuguese Roman Catholics were not in familiar with the traditions of Eastern Christianity . In the view of Portuguese Missioneries the Nasranis who practice the Rituals of Eastern Christianity are new traditionals and there for they called the Malankara Nazranis ''Puttankuttukar'', or \"New Party\" and they called themselves as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\".  Following the association with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the church was often known as the Malankara Syrian Church (Malayalam: \u0d2e\u0d32\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d30 \u0d38\u0d41\u0d31\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d38\u0d2d) in reference to their connection to the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac tradition]].\n\n==Early history of Christianity in India==\n[[File:SaintThomasChristian'sDivisionsHistoryFinal-en.svg|alt=|thumb|265x265px|Saint Thomas Christians - Divisions- History in a nutshell]]\nAs a Saint Thomas Christian group, the Malankara Church traced its origins to [[Thomas the Apostle]], said to have proselytized in India in the 1st century.<ref name=Gregorios285/> Different strains of the tradition have him arriving either by sea<ref name=\"T.K.

From the early 4th century the [[Patriarch of the Church of the East]] provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch [[Ishoyahb III]] solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community.<ref>Baum & Winkler, p. 53.</ref> In the 8th century Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] organised the community as the [[India (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Ecclesiastical Province of India]], one of the church's illustrious Provinces of the Exterior. After this point the Province of India was headed by a [[metropolitan bishop]], provided from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\".<ref name=Baum52/> His [[metropolitan see]] was probably in [[Cranganore]], or (perhaps nominally) in [[Mylapore]], where the shrine of Thomas was located.<ref name=Baum52/> Under him were a varying number of [[bishops]], as well as a native [[Archdeacon]], who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power.<ref name=Baum52/>\n\n===Cheppeds: Collection of deeds on copper plates===\nThe Rulers of [[Kerala]], in appreciation for their assistance, gave to the Malankara Nazranis, three deeds on copper plates. They gave the Nasranis various rights and privileges which were written on copper plates. These are known as Cheppeds, Royal Grants, Sasanam etc.<ref name=\"SG Pothen\">Syrian Christians of Kerala- SG Pothen- page 32-33 ( 1970)</ref>\n\n#''Iravi Corttan Deed'': In 1225 AD Sri Vira Raghava Chakravarti gave a deed to Iravi Corttan ( Eravi Karthan) of Mahadevarpattanam in 774.

Though technically subordinate to the metropolitan, the archdeacon wielded great ecclesiastical and secular power, to the extent that he was considered the secular leader of the community and served as effective head of the Indian Church in times when the province was absent a bishop. Unlike the metropolitan, who was evidently always an East Syriac sent by the patriarch, the archdeacon was a native Saint Thomas Christian. In the documented period the position was evidently hereditary, belonging to the [[Pakalomattam]] family, who claimed a privileged connection to Thomas the Apostle.<ref name=Baum52/><ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\nDetails on the archidiaconate prior to the arrival of the Portuguese are elusive, but Patriarch [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780 \u2013 823) called the Archdeacon of India the \"head of the faithful in India\", implying an elevated status by at least that time.<ref>Vadakkekara, pp. 271.</ref> In the recorded period of its history, the office of archdeacon was substantially different in India than in the rest of the Church of the East or other Christian churches. In the broader Church of the East, each bishop was attended by an archdeacon, but in India, there was only ever one archdeacon, even when the province had multiple bishops serving it.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 272.</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Church of the East's hierarchy in most of Asia in the 14th century, India was effectively cut off from the church's heartland in Mesopotamia and formal contact was severed. By the late 15th century India had had no metropolitan for several generations, and the authority traditionally associated with him had been vested in the archdeacon.<ref name=\"Baum105\">Baum & Winkler, p. 105.</ref> In 1491 the archdeacon sent envoys to the Patriarch of the Church of the East, as well as to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Pope of Alexandria]] and to the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], requesting a new bishop for India. The Patriarch of the Church of the East [[Shem'on IV Basidi|Shem\u02bfon IV Basidi]] responded by consecrating two bishops, Thoma and Yuhanon, and dispatching them to India.<ref name=Baum105/> These bishops helped rebuild the ecclesiastical infrastructure and reestablish fraternal ties with the patriarchate, but the years of separation had greatly affected the structure of the Indian church. Though receiving utmost respect, the metropolitan was treated as a guest in his own diocese; the Archdeacon was firmly established as the real power in the Malankara community.<ref>Vadakkekara, p. 274.</ref>\n\n==Arrival of the Portuguese==\n{{See also|Portuguese India}}\nAt the time the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a difficult position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the [[spice trade]] and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community under pressure from the forces of the powerful [[raja]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under [[Vasco da Gama]] arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community greeted them and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 122\u2013124.</ref> The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese brought to India a particularly militant brand of Christianity, the product of several centuries of struggle during the [[Reconquista]], which they hoped to spread across the world.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 127.</ref> Facilitating this objective was the ''[[Padroado Real]]'', a series of treaties and decrees in which the [[Pope]] conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref> Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in [[Goa]] and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment felt it necessary to conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the [[Latin Rite]], both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them to the authority of the [[Archbishop of Goa]].\n\nFollowing the death of Metropolitan Mar Jacob in 1552, the Portuguese became more aggressive in their efforts to subjugate the Saint Thomas Christians.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 130.</ref> Protests on the part of the natives were frustrated by events back in the Church of the East's Mesopotamian heartland, which left them devoid of consistent leadership. In 1552, the year of Jacob's death, a [[Schism of 1552|schism in the Church of the East]] resulted in there being two rival patriarchates, one of which entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]], and the other of which remained independent. At different times both patriarchs sent bishops to India, but the Portuguese were consistently able to outmaneuver the newcomers or else convert them to Latin Rite Catholicism outright.<ref>Frykenberg, pp. 130\u2013133.</ref> In 1575 the Padroado declared that neither patriarch could appoint prelates to the community without Portuguese consent, thereby cutting the Thomas Christians off from their hierarchy.<ref>Frykenberg, p. 134.</ref>\n\nBy 1599 the last Metropolitan, Abraham, had died, and the Archbishop of Goa, [[Aleixo de Menezes]], had secured the submission of the young Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy.<ref>Neill 2004, pp. 208\u2013210.</ref> That year Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]], which instituted a number of structural and liturgical reforms to the Indian church. At the synod, the parishes were brought directly under the Archbishop's authority, certain \"superstitious\" customs were anathematized, and the traditional variant of the [[East Syriac Rite]], was purged of elements unacceptable by the Latin standards.<ref>Neill 2004, p. 214.</ref> Though the Saint Thomas Christians were now formally part of the Catholic Church, the conduct of the Portuguese over the next decades fueled resentment in parts of the community, ultimately leading to open resistance.<ref name=\"Frykenberg136\"/>\n\n==Coonan Cross and the independent church==\n{{See also|Coonan Cross Oath}}\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Latin prelates and what remained of the native hierarchy. This came to a head in 1641 with the ascension of two new protagonists on either side of the contention: Francis Garcia, the new Archbishop of Kodungalloor, and Archdeacon [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George.<ref name=\"Frykenberg367\">Frykenberg, p. 367.</ref> In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the arrival in India of a mysterious figure named [[Ahatallah]].<ref name=Frykenberg367/><ref>Neill 2004, p. 316.</ref>\n\nAhatallah arrived in [[Mylapore]] in 1652, claiming to be the rightful [[Patriarch of Antioch]] who had been sent by the Catholic pope to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\".<ref name=\"Neill317\">Neill 2004, p. 317.</ref> Ahatallah's true biography is obscure, but some details have been established. He appears to have been a [[Syriac Orthodox]] Bishop of Damascus who converted to Catholicism and went to Rome in 1632. He then returned to Syria in order to bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Hidayat Allah]] into communion with Rome. He had not accomplished this by the time Hidayat Allah died in 1639, after which point Ahatallah began claiming he was Hidayat Allah's rightful successor. In 1646 he was in [[Egypt]] at the court of the [[Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Mark VI of Alexandria|Mark VI]], who dispatched him to India in 1652, evidently in response to a request for aid from Archdeacon Thomas. Reckoning him an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him, but allowed him to meet with members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy, whom he impressed greatly. The Portuguese put him on a ship bound for Cochin and Goa, and Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin demanding to meet with the Patriarch. The Portuguese refused, asserting that he was a dangerous invader and that the ship had already sailed on to Goa.<ref name=Neill317/>\n\nAhatallah was never heard from again in India, and rumours soon spread that Archbishop Garcia had disposed of him before he ever reached Goa.<ref name=\"Neill319\">Neill 2004, p. 319.</ref> Contemporary accounts allege that he was drowned in Cochin harbour, or even that the Portuguese burned him at the stake.<ref name=Neill319/><ref>Frykenberg, p. 368.</ref> In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, from whence he was sent on to Europe, but he evidently died in [[Paris]] before reaching Rome where his case was to be heard.<ref name=Neill319/> In any event, Garcia's dismissiveness towards the Saint Thomas Christians' appeals only embittered the community further.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\nThis was the last straw for the Saint Thomas Christians, and in 1653 Thomas and representatives of the community met at the Church of Our Lady in [[Mattancherry]] to take bold action. In a great ceremony before a crucifix and lighted candles, they swore a solemn oath that they would never obey Garcia or the Portuguese again, and that they accepted only the Archdeacon as their shepherd.<ref name=Neill319/> The Malankara Church and all its successor churches regard this declaration, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] (Malayalam: ''\u0d15\u0d42\u0d28\u0d7b \u0d15\u0d41\u0d30\u0d3f\u0d36\u0d41 \u0d38\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02''), after the outdoor cross in the churchyard, as the moment when their church regained its independence.<ref name=Neill319/>\n\n==Later development==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|360px|The first saint of India Malankara church [[Gheevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala]] ]]\n[[File:Mar Thoma III.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Mar Thoma III]], 3rd Malankara Metropolitan]]\n\nThe oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community.  The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Coonan Kurishu Satyam ([[Coonan Cross Oath]]). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thoma, the [[St. Thomas Christians]] publicly took an oath in [[Mattancherry]], Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese Catholic bishops and the [[Jesuit]] missionaries. Until the Portuguese arrival, Malankara Christians never even heard of the [[Roman Catholic Pope]]. Unfortunately there was no Metropolitan present in the Malankara Church at that time. Hence in the same year, at Alangad, Archdeacon Thoma was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name [[Mar Thoma I]]. The Portuguese missionaries attempted for reconciliation with Saint Thomas Christians but was not successful. Later Pope Alexander VII sent the Syrian bishop Joseph Sebastiani at the head of a Carmelite delegation who succeeded in convincing majority of Saint Thomas Christians, including [[Parambil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar]] and Kadavil Chandy Kathanar.Episcopal consecration of [[Mar Thoma I]] as a Bishop was regularized in the year 1665 by Mar [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]].Later Palliveettil Chandy Kathanar was consecrated as the bishop for the Syriac Catholics This led to the first permanent split in the Saint Thomas Christian community. Thereafter, the faction affiliated with the Catholic Church under Parambil Mar Chandy was designated the ''Pazhayakoottukar'', or \"Old Party\", while the branch affiliated with Mar Thoma was called the ''Puthankoottukar'', or \"New Party\".<ref name=\"Vadakkekara86\" /><ref name=\"Frykenberg, p. 361\"/><ref name=\"Fernando, p. 79\"/><ref name=\"Chaput, pp. 7\u20138\"/> These appellations have been somewhat controversial, as both groups considered themselves the true heirs to the Saint Thomas tradition, and saw the other as heretical.<ref name=\"Vadakkekara, p. 84 and note\"/>\n\n[[Mar Thoma I]] with 44 churches(out of 69 total churches)and their congregations were the body from which the [[Malankara Syrian Church]]es ([[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]], [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] and [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] originated. The Catholic faction constantly challenged the legitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan .This made it essential to rectify the illegitimacy of the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan. In 1665, [[Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel]], a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the Saint Thomas Christians under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"Geddes\">Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; [[Michael Geddes]], 1694;</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] regularised the consecration of Archdeacon as Metropolitan as per the apostolic standards of Kaiveppu (traditional legitimate way of laying hands by a valid Bishop). This resulted in the spiritual relationship the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch and the reaffirmation of the orthodox faith in the Church. The 18th century saw the gradual introduction of West Syriac liturgy and script to the Malabar Coast, a process that continued through the 19th century.\n\nThe arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665, marked the introduction of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] in the Malankara Church.\n\nIn 1912, a Catholicate was instituted in Malankara by the Syriac orthodox Patriarch [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]], thereby starting a century of legal proceedings between factions of the church which supported the Catholicate, and those who opposed it on behalf of the claims that, the [[Ignatius Abdul Masih II|Abdul Masih]] was excommunicated.\n\nThe Malankara Church experienced a series of splits over the centuries, resulting in the formation of several churches, some of which embraced the jurisdiction of foreign churches, while others remained autocephalous and autonomous churches.\n\nThe churches that share the Malankara Church tradition are:\n#[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous oriental orthodox church.<ref>http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=9&pagetypeID=9&sitecode=hq&pageno=1</ref> Catholicos of the East and [[Malankara Metropolitan]] entroned on the apostolic throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] is the primate of the church.\n#[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]: an autonomous oriental orthodox church under the jurisdiction of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]].\n#[[Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]: an Independent and autonomous Malankara church under the jurisdiction of Marthoma Metropolitan\n#[[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]]: a [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] [[Eastern Catholic]] church within the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] communion.\n#[[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]]: an autonomous and autocephalous church under the jurisdiction of its own independent Metropolitan.\n\n==See also==\n<!---only for articles not mentioned above--->\n*'''Pazhaya Seminary''' [[Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam]]\n* [[Malankara Metropolitan]]\n* [[List of Malankara Metropolitans]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last1=Baum|first1=Wilhelm|authorlink1=Wilhelm Baum|last2=Winkler|first2=Dietmar W.|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|year=2003|location=London-New York|publisher=Routledge-Curzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{Cite journal |last1= Chaput|first1= Pascale|year= 1999 |title= La Double identit\u00e9 des chr\u00e9tiens keralais : confessions et castes chr\u00e9tiennes au Kerala (Inde du Sud) / The Double Identity of Kerala Christians: Confessions and Christian Castes (South India)|journal= Archives des sciences sociales des religions|publisher= |volume= 106|issue= |pages= 5\u201323|url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1999_num_106_1_1084#|doi= }}\n* Fernando, Leonard; Gispert-Sauch, G.
