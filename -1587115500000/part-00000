They appear in one of several adolescent [[detective fiction|detective]] series Blyton wrote.\n\nThe Secret Seven consists of Peter (the society's head), Janet (Peter's sister), Jack, Barbara, George, Pam and Colin. Jack's sister Susie and her best friend Binkie make occasional appearances in the books; they hate the Secret Seven and delight in playing tricks designed to humiliate them, although this is partly fuelled by their almost obsessive desire to belong to the society.\n\nUnlike most other Blyton series, this one takes place during the school term time because the characters go to [[day school]]s.\n\nContinuing Blyton's series, [[Pamela Butchart]] wrote two new adventures in the series, adding elements of horror.\n\n==Origins==\nThe names Secret Seven and [[Famous Five (Greyfriars School)|Famous Five]] had already been used by author [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]], under the pen-name Frank Richards, in his long-running series of stories featuring [[Billy Bunter]] and [[Greyfriars School]]. The [[The Secret Seven (Frank Richards)|Secret Seven]] was the name of a secret society that featured in a series of eleven stories published in ''[[The Magnet]]'' magazine in 1934;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the term \"Famous Five\" dates from 1910 and is applied to a group of the leading characters: Harry Wharton, Frank Nugent, Bob Cherry, Johnny Bull and Hurree Jamset Ram Singh.\n\nIt is not clear whether Enid Blyton was influenced by Hamilton's work. Blyton's elder daughter, Gillian Baverstock, describes a conversation between the author and her publisher that led to the inception of Blyton's Secret Seven. The publisher's own children, the eldest of whom was named Peter, had formed a secret society with their friends. They met in an old shed, used secret passwords and had badges inscribed with \"SS\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAfter corresponding with the real-life Peter, in 1948 Blyton published her first Secret Seven story, which describes how her fictional society came to be formed. This was a short story titled \"The Secret of the Old Mill\". It followed an earlier short story, \"At Seaside Cottage\", which introduced the leading characters Peter and Janet prior to the formation of the society. There followed a further five short stories and fifteen full-length books.\n\n==Short stories==\nThe Secret Seven appeared in seven short stories by Blyton, including a mini-novella explaining how the society was formed. These were left uncollected until 1997, when all but \"At Seaside Cottage\" were published in a single volume by Hodder Children's Books under the title of ''Secret Seven: Short Story Collection''.\n\n#At Seaside Cottage (1947) \u2013 first published as a complete short story book\n#Secret of the Old Mill (1948) \u2013 first published in \"Secret of the Old Mill\"\n#The Humbug Adventure  (1954) \u2013 first published in Enid Blyton's Magazine Annual No.1\n#Adventure on the Way Home (1955) \u2013 first published in Enid Blyton's Magazine Annual No.2\n#An Afternoon with the Secret Seven (1956) \u2013 first published in Enid Blyton's Magazine Annual No.3\n#Where Are the Secret Seven?

Although intelligent and tenacious, he is easily slighted and angered. A strong and capable leader, he has a bossy streak, verging on being downright unreasonable (particularly about wearing badges and remembering the password), reducing Pam and Barbara to tears, and on one occasion, causing Jack to temporarily leave the group. He, Janet and Jack are often closer with each other than other members of the group. Peter sometimes teases his sister, but acknowledges her as a good member of the Society.\n*'''Janet''' \u2013 Peter's sister and second-in-command. Janet is very observant, has a keen memory and takes her work seriously. She is more headstrong and braver than the other girls in the group. Her arch-enemy is Susie. Janet is very good friends with Pam and also gets well along with Jack. She thinks of many good ideas. She is quite messy, and takes too long to write if trying to write neatly.\n*'''Jack''' \u2013 Peter's best friend. He is one of the most efficient group members, and is frequently annoyed by his younger sister, Susie, who takes advantage of his tendency to forget the password. He gets along well with everyone in the group, especially Peter, but is also the only member who will willingly stand up to Peter when he feels that he is behaving unreasonably, to the extent that he once walked out on the group after an argument with him (although they reconciled at the end). Jack lives very near to Peter and Janet. He thinks Janet is lot better than the other girls and wishes Susie was like Janet.\n*'''Pam''' \u2013 A girl at Janet's school. Her best friend is Barbara and she giggles a lot. Her full first name is Pamela. She sometimes proves herself a worthy member of the Secret Seven by getting brainwaves{{clarify|reason=She often provides last minute insights when the group is stuck, helping to piece clues together to solve the mystery.|date=August 2016}}, but is sometimes careless, such as yelling out the password and squealing when Peter was nearly pushed out of their \"secret\" treehouse.\n*'''Barbara''' \u2013 Another girl at Janet's school. She and Pam generally work (and giggle) together when<ref name=\":0\" /> looking for clues or information. They are out a lot together, such as not being able to turn up to a meeting because they are going to the same party. Barbara was the only member to be chosen by Peter: the other four were all selected by Janet.\n*'''Colin''' \u2013 A boy at Peter's school. Colin is a valuable member of the society, though perhaps the quietest of the boys. He has a large family, most of whom live with him. He finds his family tiresome and is afraid of the dark. He made the mystery in \"Secret Seven Adventure\" warm up when he saw a man escaping from Lady Thomas's house.\n*'''George''' \u2013 A boy at Peter's school. His best friend is Colin. George's father once banned him from the society, but he later realized his mistake and let George rejoin. Not much else is known about him, as he is rather undeveloped as a character.\n'''''Scamper''''' \u2013 Janet and Peter's pet dog and beloved companion. He is not an official member of the Secret Seven, but the children count him as one, due to his regular usefulness in the denouement of the stories. He has temporarily filled in for members when they have left the group for any reason. He is a friendly golden [[English Cocker Spaniel]]. He loves food, especially biscuits.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n*'''Susie''' \u2013 Jack's younger sister who frequently aggravates him and the Society which she enjoys humiliating and tormenting with her quick wit. However, this stems from her burning desire to join the Society, which Peter regularly refuses her. This is actually something of a disadvantage for Peter, as Susie is considerably more clever and cunning than some of the other members, especially Barbara and Pam, and would potentially be a more valuable member. The Seven occasionally make a temporary truce with Susie, and sometimes she helps them solve the mysteries.\n*'''Binkie''' \u2013 Susie's best friend, who stays with her sometimes. Binkie is described as being very stupid and idiotic, but can sometimes make up very clever, but rude songs and poems about the Seven.\n*'''Jeff''' \u2013 A friend of Susie's, who appears as her sidekick in a few of the earlier books. He plays a similar role to Binkie, who had not appeared at that point.\n*'''Bony''' - Susie's and Jack's French friend who appears in one book. His real name is Jean Baptiste Boneparte. He is very timid, shy and loves dogs. Dogs love him too and are often attracted to him. He is more friendly towards Susie than to Jack and is often annoyed with the S.S. He had been a member of Susie's club for a few days before he returned to France and soon after that the club broke up.\n*'''Jack the farmer''' \u2013 Jack the farmer is Peter and Janet's father. He is not as strict as some parents of the day, but has taught Peter some very strong ideas about right and wrong.\n*'''Peter and Janet's mother''' \u2013 Peter and Janet's mother is supportive of the Secret Seven and their good work. She frequently provides snacks for their meetings.\n*'''Jack's mother''' \u2013 Unlike Peter's mother, Jack's mother does not think the Secret Seven is particularly important and gets angry when Jack puts all his effort into fulfilling Peter's wishes although she does sometimes provide for the Seven.\n*'''Matt the Shepherd''' \u2013 Peter's father's colleague, who works on the farm. He has a dog called Shadow who is stolen in a mystery but is later recovered.\n*'''Shadow''' - Matty the good old shepherd's strong, heavy shepherd dog who loves his master very much. Matt too loves him like a brother. He is stolen in a mystery in the book ''Shock for Secret Seven'' but is later recovered.\n*'''The Inspector''' \u2013 The police inspector who the Secret Seven always report the cases to. He has become a good friend of the Seven\n*'''Postie the Postman''' \u2013 Postie was the postman of the area and almost all dogs were attracted towards him. He was found to be criminal in the book ''Shock for Secret Seven'' and was jailed.\n*'''The Gardener''' \u2013 Peter and Janet's gardener, who has a very bad temper but can be witty.\n\n==French series==\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[Evelyne Lallemand]] wrote an additional series of 11 books about the Secret Seven, nine of which were translated into English by [[Anthea Bell]] and published in paperback by Knight Books.

They appear in one of several adolescent [[detective fiction|detective]] series Blyton wrote.\n\nThe Secret Seven consists of Peter (the society's head), Janet (Peter's sister), Jack, Barbara, George, Pam and Colin. Jack's sister Susie and her best friend Binkie make occasional appearances in the books; they hate the Secret Seven and delight in playing tricks designed to humiliate them, although this is partly fuelled by their almost obsessive desire to belong to the society.\n\nUnlike most other Blyton series, this one takes place during the school term time because the characters go to [[day school]]s.\n\nContinuing Blyton's series, [[Pamela Butchart]] wrote two new adventures in the series, adding elements of horror.\n\n==Origins==\nThe names Secret Seven and [[Famous Five (Greyfriars School)|Famous Five]] had already been used by author [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]], under the pen-name Frank Richards, in his long-running series of stories featuring [[Billy Bunter]] and [[Greyfriars School]]. The [[The Secret Seven (Frank Richards)|Secret Seven]] was the name of a secret society that featured in a series of eleven stories published in ''[[The Magnet]]'' magazine in 1934;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the term \"Famous Five\" dates from 1910 and is applied to a group of the leading characters: Harry Wharton, Frank Nugent, Bob Cherry, Johnny Bull and Hurree Jamset Ram Singh.\n\nIt is not clear whether Enid Blyton was influenced by Hamilton's work. Blyton's elder daughter, Gillian Baverstock, describes a conversation between the author and her publisher that led to the inception of Blyton's Secret Seven. The publisher's own children, the eldest of whom was named Peter, had formed a secret society with their friends. They met in an old shed, used secret passwords and had badges inscribed with \"SS\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAfter corresponding with the real-life Peter, in 1948 Blyton published her first Secret Seven story, which describes how her fictional society came to be formed. This was a short story titled \"The Secret of the Old Mill\". It followed an earlier short story, \"At Seaside Cottage\", which introduced the leading characters Peter and Janet prior to the formation of the society. There followed a further five short stories and fifteen full-length books.\n\n==Short stories==\nThe Secret Seven appeared in seven short stories by Blyton, including a mini-novella explaining how the society was formed. These were left uncollected until 1997, when all but \"At Seaside Cottage\" were published in a single volume by Hodder Children's Books under the title of ''Secret Seven: Short Story Collection''.\n\n#At Seaside Cottage (1947) \u2013 first published as a complete short story book\n#Secret of the Old Mill (1948) \u2013 first published in \"Secret of the Old Mill\"\n#The Humbug Adventure  (1954) \u2013 first published in Enid Blyton's Magazine Annual No.1\n#Adventure on the Way Home (1955) \u2013 first published in Enid Blyton's Magazine Annual No.2\n#An Afternoon with the Secret Seven (1956) \u2013 first published in Enid Blyton's Magazine Annual No.3\n#Where Are the Secret Seven?

Suspecting a person is being held prisoner, the Seven then investigate the mystery.\n#''Secret Seven Adventure'' (1950) While the Seven are playing Red Indians in a wood, Peter and Colin encounter a man who has just stolen Lady Lucy Thomas's pearl necklace from Milton Manor. The search for the thief leads the children to a circus field and lions. \n#''Well Done Secret Seven'' (1951) The Secret Seven build a tree house to escape the summer heat. There, they meet a dirty boy and his injured kitten. The boy gives them some clues to a mystery involving a planned mail heist.\n#''Secret Seven on the Trail'' (1952) A trick by Susie and her infuriating Famous Five group sends Jack and George on a night trek to Tigger's Barn. But the prank leads the Secret Seven to a group of train robbers.\n#''Go Ahead Secret Seven'' (1953) A little shadowing practice by George goes awry and his parents force him to resign from the Secret Seven. Scamper is installed as his temporary replacement. Some shadowing by Colin puts the Seven on the trail of a man who shoves dogs down a coal hole. The group must then solve the mystery of the stolen dogs. By the end of the book, George is reinstalled as a member.\n#''Good Work Secret Seven'' (1954) As [[Bonfire Night]] approaches, Susie and her friends play a prank on the Seven, leading them on a wild goose-chase to a shed. Later, Peter and Janet's father's car is stolen \u2014 with them inside \u2014 but the car is soon abandoned. The group's plans for Bonfire Night seem scuppered when Scamper unwittingly sets alight their collection of fireworks. The Seven investigate the car thieves, with Peter disguising himself as a [[Guy_Fawkes_Night#Songs,_Guys_and_decline|guy]] to keep watch for suspects at a cafe. \n#''Secret Seven Win Through'' (1955) The Seven are evicted from their shed while it is painted, and find a new meeting place \u2014 a cave on Peter and Janet's father's property.

But after Janet spots a strange face at the window of Torling Castle, The Seven must investigate.\n#''Shock for the Secret Seven'' (1961) Dogs are going missing all over town.

A boy named Bob Smith asks the Seven to help an elderly farm worker, Tolly, pay a vet's bill for a lame horse that is at risk of being euthanized with a bullet. The children save the horse. Toward the end of the book, some horse thieves are thwarted. During the story, Janet reads a ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]'' novel.\n\n==The Society==\n\n*'''Peter''' \u2013 The society's leader and the most mature of the group. Although intelligent and tenacious, he is easily slighted and angered. A strong and capable leader, he has a bossy streak, verging on being downright unreasonable (particularly about wearing badges and remembering the password), reducing Pam and Barbara to tears, and on one occasion, causing Jack to temporarily leave the group. He, Janet and Jack are often closer with each other than other members of the group. Peter sometimes teases his sister, but acknowledges her as a good member of the Society.\n*'''Janet''' \u2013 Peter's sister and second-in-command. Janet is very observant, has a keen memory and takes her work seriously. She is more headstrong and braver than the other girls in the group. Her arch-enemy is Susie. Janet is very good friends with Pam and also gets well along with Jack. She thinks of many good ideas. She is quite messy, and takes too long to write if trying to write neatly.\n*'''Jack''' \u2013 Peter's best friend. He is one of the most efficient group members, and is frequently annoyed by his younger sister, Susie, who takes advantage of his tendency to forget the password. He gets along well with everyone in the group, especially Peter, but is also the only member who will willingly stand up to Peter when he feels that he is behaving unreasonably, to the extent that he once walked out on the group after an argument with him (although they reconciled at the end). Jack lives very near to Peter and Janet. He thinks Janet is lot better than the other girls and wishes Susie was like Janet.\n*'''Pam''' \u2013 A girl at Janet's school.

He is not an official member of the Secret Seven, but the children count him as one, due to his regular usefulness in the denouement of the stories.
