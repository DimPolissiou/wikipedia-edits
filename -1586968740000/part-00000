The name is of ancient origin, and is retained in the name of the [[Hadhramaut Governorate]] of [[Yemen]]. The people of Hadhramaut are called [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]]. They formerly spoke [[Hadramautic language|Hadramautic]], but now predominantly speak [[Hadhrami Arabic]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name \"\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt\" is not exactly known, and there are numerous competing hypotheses about its meaning. The most common [[folk etymology]] is that the region's name means \"death has come,\" from {{lang-ar|\u062d\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0631|\u1e25a\u1e0dara|lit=he came}} and {{lang-ar|\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a|mawt|lit=death}}, though there are multiple explanations for how it came to be known as such. One explanation is that this is a nickname of [[Amar bin Qahtan|'Amar ibn Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101n]], a legendary invader of the region, whose battles always left many dead. Another theory is that after the destruction of [[Thamud|Tham\u016bd]], the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Saleh|\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25]] relocated himself and about 4,000 of his followers to the region and it was there that he died, thus lending the region its morbid name \"death has come.\" A third related etymology posits that {{lang|ar|\u062d\u0636\u0631}} refers to the inhabitants of the area, themselves, and hints that the way of life of the ancient Hadhrami people was severe and ascetic in the eyes of the bordering kingdoms situated in today's North Yemen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt is also identified with [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hazarmaveth|Hazarmawet]] ({{lang-hbo|\u05d7\u05b2\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05ea|italic=no|rtl=yes}}; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:26<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10:26|KJV}}</ref> and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 1:20).<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:20|KJV}}</ref> There, it is the name of a son of [[Joktan]] (who is also identified with [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]]), the ancestor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to various Bible dictionaries, the name \"Hazarmaveth\" means \"court of death,\" reflecting a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies.\n\nScholarly theories of the name's origin are somewhat more varied, but none have gained general acceptance. [[Juris Zarins]], rediscoverer of the city claimed to be the ancient [[Incense Route]] trade capital [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]] in Oman, suggested that the name may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}} {{transl|grc|hydreumata}}, or enclosed (and often fortified) watering stations at [[wadi]]s.

There, they were called ''hydreumata''.}}\n\nThough it accurately describes the configuration of settlements in the pre-7th century Wadi \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt, this explanation for the name is anachronistic and has gained no wider scholarly acceptance. Already in the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|period before the advent of Islam]] in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], variations of the name are attested as early as the middle of the First Millennium BC.

The name is of ancient origin, and is retained in the name of the [[Hadhramaut Governorate]] of [[Yemen]]. The people of Hadhramaut are called [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]]. They formerly spoke [[Hadramautic language|Hadramautic]], but now predominantly speak [[Hadhrami Arabic]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name \"\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt\" is not exactly known, and there are numerous competing hypotheses about its meaning. The most common [[folk etymology]] is that the region's name means \"death has come,\" from {{lang-ar|\u062d\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0631|\u1e25a\u1e0dara|lit=he came}} and {{lang-ar|\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a|mawt|lit=death}}, though there are multiple explanations for how it came to be known as such. One explanation is that this is a nickname of [[Amar bin Qahtan|'Amar ibn Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101n]], a legendary invader of the region, whose battles always left many dead. Another theory is that after the destruction of [[Thamud|Tham\u016bd]], the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Saleh|\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25]] relocated himself and about 4,000 of his followers to the region and it was there that he died, thus lending the region its morbid name \"death has come.\" A third related etymology posits that {{lang|ar|\u062d\u0636\u0631}} refers to the inhabitants of the area, themselves, and hints that the way of life of the ancient Hadhrami people was severe and ascetic in the eyes of the bordering kingdoms situated in today's North Yemen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt is also identified with [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hazarmaveth|Hazarmawet]] ({{lang-hbo|\u05d7\u05b2\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05ea|italic=no|rtl=yes}}; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:26<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10:26|KJV}}</ref> and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 1:20).<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:20|KJV}}</ref> There, it is the name of a son of [[Joktan]] (who is also identified with [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]]), the ancestor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to various Bible dictionaries, the name \"Hazarmaveth\" means \"court of death,\" reflecting a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies.\n\nScholarly theories of the name's origin are somewhat more varied, but none have gained general acceptance. [[Juris Zarins]], rediscoverer of the city claimed to be the ancient [[Incense Route]] trade capital [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]] in Oman, suggested that the name may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}} {{transl|grc|hydreumata}}, or enclosed (and often fortified) watering stations at [[wadi]]s. In a ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'' interview,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/index.html |title=Lost City of Arabia |format=NOVA online interview with Dr. Juris Zarins, September 1996 |publisher=[[PBS]] |date=September 1996}}</ref> he described Ubar as:\n\n{{Quote|a kind of fortress/administration center set up to protect the water supply from raiding [[Bedouin]] tribes. Surrounding the site, as far as six miles away, were smaller villages, which served as small-scale encampments for the caravans. An interesting parallel to this are the fortified water holes in the [[Eastern Desert]] of [[Egypt]] from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. There, they were called ''hydreumata''.}}\n\nThough it accurately describes the configuration of settlements in the pre-7th century Wadi \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt, this explanation for the name is anachronistic and has gained no wider scholarly acceptance. Already in the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|period before the advent of Islam]] in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], variations of the name are attested as early as the middle of the First Millennium BC.

The Qu'aiti dynasty was founded by [['Umar bin Awadh al-Qu\u2019aiti]], a [[Yafa\u2019i]] tribesman whose wealth and influence as hereditary [[Jemadar]] of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]'s armed forces enabled him to establish the Qu'aiti dynasty in the latter half of the 19th century, winning British recognition of his paramount status in the region, in 1882. The British Government and the traditional and scholarly sultan Ali bin Salah signed a treaty in 1937 appointing the British government as \"advisors\" in Hadhramaut. The British exiled him to Aden in 1945, but the Protectorate lasted until 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 1967, the former British [[Colony of Aden]] and the former Aden Protectorate including Hadramaut became an independent [[Communism|Communist]] state, the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]], later the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.

See [[History of Yemen]] for recent history.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe capital and largest city of Hadhramaut is the port [[Mukalla]].

Hypermasculine attitudes can also include emotional self-control as a sign of toughness.<ref name = \"Dennehy\">Dennehy, T.; Ben-Zeev, Avi et al. (2012). \"Hypermasculinity In The Media: When Men 'Walk Into The Fog' To Avoid Affective Communication\". \"Psychology of Popular Media Culture\" '\"1\"' (1):53\u201361. {{DOI: 10.1037/a002709}}</ref> To be emotionally hardened or indifferent, especially toward women, is to display what Thomas Scheff calls \"character\" \u2013 composure and impassiveness in times of great stress or emotion.<ref name = \"Scheff\">Scheff, Thomas. (2006). \"Hypermasculinity and Violence as a Social System\". \"2\" (2):1\u201310. {{ISSN: 1558-8769}}</ref> Of this hypermasculine stoicism, Scheff observes, \"it is masculine men that have 'character'. A man with character who is under stress is not going to cry and blubber like a woman or child might.\"\n\nSelf-imposed emotional monitoring by men has also greatly affected the conditions in which they communicate with women.<ref name=\"Dennehy\"/> Ben-Zeev, Scharnetzki, Chan and Dennehy (2012) write of a recent study that has shown many men to deliberately avoid behaviours and attitudes such as compassion and emotional expression, deeming these traits feminine and thus rejecting them altogether. Scheff adds, \"The hypermasculine pattern leads to competition, rather than connection between persons.\"<ref name = \"Scheff\"/> In the context of intimate or emotional communication (especially confrontation) with women, the masculine male often withdraws emotionally, refusing to engage in what is termed affective communication (Scheff).
