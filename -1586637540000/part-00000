In 1923, he became the chairman of the board of the Postum Cereal Company, and they developed a larger variety of food products, including [[Clarence Birdseye|Birdseye Frozen Foods]]. The company became the [[General Foods]] Corporation in 1929. Post and Hutton divorced in 1935.

During this time, Davies and Post acquired many valuable Russian works of art from Soviet authorities.\n\nIn 1951, their Long Island estate, which she had purchased in 1922 with Hutton, located in [[Brookville, New York]], was sold to [[Long Island University]] for $200,000. It became C.W. Post College in 1954, now known as [[LIU Post]]. In 1966, she became honorary housemother of Zeta Beta Tau's Gamma Delta chapter, often hosting the fraternity brothers for brunches. Post served as the honorary house mother of the college's first local fraternity, Sigma Beta Epsilon, which, in 1969, became the New York Beta chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]. Since Post had borne only girls, she referred to the fraternity of sons-in-law as her \"boys\", while they called her \"Mother Marjorie\". Post was honored by [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity as a \"Golden Daughter of Minerva\".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nHer final marriage, in 1958, was to Herbert A.

In 1905, she married investment banker Edward Bennett Close of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], and they divorced in 1919.

Johnson (son of author [[Owen Johnson (writer)|Owen Johnson]]), and orchestra conductor [[L\u00e9on Barzin]].\nVia his second marriage, Edward Bennett Close would later become the paternal grandfather of actress [[Glenn Close]].\n\nPost was married for a second time, in 1920, to financier [[Edward Francis Hutton]]. In 1923, he became the chairman of the board of the Postum Cereal Company, and they developed a larger variety of food products, including [[Clarence Birdseye|Birdseye Frozen Foods]]. The company became the [[General Foods]] Corporation in 1929. Post and Hutton divorced in 1935. They had one daughter:\n*[[Dina Merrill|Nedenia Marjorie Hutton]] (1923-2017), better known as the actress [[Dina Merrill]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" />\n\n[[File:Carlton Skinner aboard the Sea Cloud.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Marjorie Merriweather Post and her husband, Ambassador Joseph E.

Davies]], a Washington, D.C. lawyer. They had no children and were divorced in 1955. From 1937 to 1938, in a crucial period leading up to [[World War II]], Davies served as the American ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]], ruled at that time by [[Joseph Stalin]]. During this time, Davies and Post acquired many valuable Russian works of art from Soviet authorities.\n\nIn 1951, their Long Island estate, which she had purchased in 1922 with Hutton, located in [[Brookville, New York]], was sold to [[Long Island University]] for $200,000. It became C.W. Post College in 1954, now known as [[LIU Post]]. In 1966, she became honorary housemother of Zeta Beta Tau's Gamma Delta chapter, often hosting the fraternity brothers for brunches. Post served as the honorary house mother of the college's first local fraternity, Sigma Beta Epsilon, which, in 1969, became the New York Beta chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]. Since Post had borne only girls, she referred to the fraternity of sons-in-law as her \"boys\", while they called her \"Mother Marjorie\". Post was honored by [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity as a \"Golden Daughter of Minerva\".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nHer final marriage, in 1958, was to Herbert A.

The two ice resurfacing machines prepared to maintain the surface of the ice track both malfunctioned.  A reserve machine was employed, but it left the ice surface too rough and pitted to permit safe racing by the athletes.  Finally, one of the original two machines was repaired sufficiently to fix the track.  Said Arie Koops, director of Dutch speed skating of the delay and who felt that the third machine wasn't properly prepared, \"When skaters are not prepared for a race you don't send them out. It should be the same with the resurfacing machine.  If one machine was broken, they should have prepared the third. It was standing there in the garage.

minutes during the first run, due to concerns over the naturally deteriorating quality of the ice after so many skaters had raced on it and the seeming inability of resurfacing equipment to do anything about it.  The two ice resurfacing machines prepared to maintain the surface of the ice track both malfunctioned.  A reserve machine was employed, but it left the ice surface too rough and pitted to permit safe racing by the athletes.  Finally, one of the original two machines was repaired sufficiently to fix the track.  Said Arie Koops, director of Dutch speed skating of the delay and who felt that the third machine wasn't properly prepared, \"When skaters are not prepared for a race you don't send them out. It should be the same with the resurfacing machine.  If one machine was broken, they should have prepared the third. It was standing there in the garage. I have never seen anything like this.\"<ref>Harris, Beth ([[Associated Press]]), \"[http://www.ajc.com/sports/speedskating-resumes-after-ice-307143.html Speedskating resumes after ice resurfacing delay]\", ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', 15 February 2010.</ref>  A [[Frank Zamboni|Zamboni]] brand resurfacer is being brought in from Calgary for the remainder of the games.<ref>http://www.ctvolympics.ca/speed-skating/news/newsid=43070.html#zamboni+airlift+rescue+oval</ref> American skater [[Shani Davis]] withdrew from the event over concerns that it was getting to be too late and too dangerous.
