{"title_page": "Formula Hybrid", "text_new": "[[Image:TexasA&M 09.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Winner Texas A&M getting sideways during 2009 Endurance event]]\n'''Formula Hybrid''' is a [[design]] and [[engineering]] challenge for [[undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] [[college]] and [[university]] students. Started at the [[Thayer School of Engineering]] at [[Dartmouth College]], and sponsored by the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]], the competition is a spinoff of the [[Formula SAE]] competition based on [[hybrid vehicle]] technology. They must design, build, and compete an [[open-wheel]], single-seat race car. This car must conform to a formula which emphasizes [[drive train]] innovation and [[fuel efficiency]] in a high-performance application.\n\nAll seven contests, 2007\u20132013, have been held at the [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], [[Loudon, New Hampshire]].\n\nThe Formula Hybrid student automotive design competition encourages the development of hybrid automotive drive trains with an emphasis on efficiency in a high-performance application. Improved efficiency in an automotive drive system can be used to increase fuel economy, performance, or both. Building on the Formula SAE program, Formula Hybrid adds an extra level of complexity: fuel efficiency.<ref>http://formula-hybrid.com/</ref>\n\nLike Formula SAE events, the Hybrid competition includes an acceleration test, [[autocross]] and endurance events, as well as engineering and construction static events. Unlike Formula SAE, Formula Hybrid events put a greater emphasis on drive train innovation and fuel efficiency.\n\n== Formula SAE Hybrid rules ==\nFor the Formula Hybrid competition conducted in 2007 and 2008, the Formula SAE rules for each of these years were utilized for the construction of the car, with the addition of Hybrid specific rules specifying the type of fuel and the hybrid definitions. Also defined are details of a competitor car that might be in the developmental stage defined as \u2018Hybrid-in-Progress\u2019 car.  A 'Hybrid-in-Progress' is an all-electric car, under the idea that next year the car will be upgraded to a full hybrid powertrain.\n\nThe difference noted in the rules state that a \u2018hybrid\u2019 Formula car must complete a 75-meter acceleration run in electric-only mode in less than 10 seconds.\nIn terms of the engine capacities for the internal combustion engine, 250cc spark ignition engine or a 310cc diesel engine can be used.\n\nStarting in 2009, the Formula Hybrid rules stood alone as a complete document, incorporating the necessary car construction and safety rules from the Formula SAE rulebook.  One large change for 2009 was the fuel allotment.  In 2007\u20132008, teams were given an allotment to cover the entire event.  In 2009, this allotment was smaller, but was only applied to the endurance event.  Teams were free to use as much fuel as needed for the other events, provided the car was filled by event officials.\n\n== Winners ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Overall Event Winner\n!

The acceleration runs are broken down to two different categories - the fully electric acceleration run and the unrestricted acceleration run. In the fully electric acceleration run the team are only allowed to utilize the power delivered by the electric system i.e., the accumulator pack (batteries or capacitors) and electric motor system.  In unlimited acceleration, the teams are free to use any system (or combination of systems) they wish.\n\n===Autocross event===\nThe autocross event involves an open loop circuit designed with chicanes, speed traps and slaloms. In 2007, the autocross competition was held in the parking lot next to the Turn 1 grandstands. In 2008 and 2009, the autocross competition was on a circuit built on the NASCAR oval track on turn 4. The competition event is designed to test the ability of the car to go around the circuit at maximum speed and drive around the tight bends and turns. The objective of the competition is to set the fastest time from the starting point and the ending point of the circuit.  As with [[Formula SAE]], the course is marked with orange traffic cones.  Hitting a cone incurs a 2 sec penalty, while failure to follow the course results in a 20 sec penalty.\n\n===Endurance event===\nThe endurance event is similar to the autocross track, except that it is closed loop and more spacious.  As with the auto-x event, the course is marked with traffic cones; hitting a cone incurs a 2 sec penalty and a failure to follow the course incurs a 20 sec penalty.  The Formula Hybrid cars are stipulated to drive a total of 22 kilometers in distance with one driver change pit stop at the half way mark. The pit stop can also be used to inspect minor details on the car by the team, but are not allowed any changes or allowed to add any fuel. The objective of the endurance race is to finish with the fastest race time while not running out of your allotted fuel.  McGill University repeated this feat in 2008 where the only other team to finish the 40-lap race was [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] which finished second.\n\nThe 2009 endurance course was longer than past years, there were only 24 total laps to cover the 22&nbsp;km distance, compared to 40 laps for 2008.  A total of 6 cars finished the 24 laps: [[Texas A&M University]] won, with [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly SLO]] second and [[Drexel University]] third.  The other three finishers were [[University of California Irvine]], [[Colorado State University]], and [[McGill University]], respectively.\n\n===Design event===\nThe Formula Hybrid competition includes an analysis and critique of the engineering design and construction of the vehicle, with an emphasis on drive train innovation, fuel efficiency, and sustainable manufacturing practices.\n\n== 2007 Competition ==\nThe 2007 Formula Hybrid Competition was organized in Loudon, New Hampshire at the New Hampshire International Speedway. A total of 6 teams participated in the competition. Though a bigger number of teams were registered for the competition, only these 6 teams were successful in getting a competitive car to the event. The six teams are the SAE teams from the universities of [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[McGill University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Florida Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]].\n\nThe inaugural competition had three events that were designed to judge the hybrid Formula car and their performance. The overall winner is determined by two categorical events \u2013 dynamic and static events. The static events included a technical inspection, a safety inspection and the official weighing of the formula cars. The dynamic events included an acceleration run, an autocross race and an endurance event. McGill University finished the fastest in autocross competition and also finished fastest in the endurance race. Yale University's car was the fastest in electric-only acceleration. Florida Institute of Technology's car was the fastest in the unrestricted acceleration event. Florida Institute of Technology, Illinois Institute of Technology and Yale University, represented their school's first entry into any Formula SAE competition.<ref name=\"formula-hybrid.com\">http://formula-hybrid.com/history/2007-results.php</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 competitions, the official results were as follows:<ref name=\"formula-hybrid.com\"/>\n\n1st Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[McGill University]] <br />\n2nd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] <br />\n3rd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Yale University]]\n\nBest Hybrid in Progress: [[Florida Institute of Technology]] <br />\nMost Innovative Design: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] <br />\nBest Hybrid Systems Engineering*: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]\n\nSpecial note * = Prize sponsored by DaimlerChrysler AG (before the split to [[Daimler AG]] and [[Chrysler]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]])\n\n== 2008 Competition ==\nThe 2008 Formula Hybrid Competition was organized in Loudon, New Hampshire at the New Hampshire International Speedway. Held for three days from May 5 to May 7, the competition saw the total number of registered teams increase to 15 teams; student teams from across the world like [[McGill University]] from Canada, [http://en.madi.ru/ MADI State Technical University from Russia] and National Chiao Tung University from Taiwan. A total of 12 teams arrived at the competition and 9 teams participated with a formula car on the track. The twelve teams were the SAE teams from the universities of [[Dartmouth College]], [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[University of Vermont]], [[McGill University]], [[North Carolina State University]], [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], [[Drexel University]], [[Florida Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://formula-hybrid.com/history/2008-competition.php</ref>\n\nThe second annual competition was conducted on the same competition pattern as in the 2007 competition (see above). The difference to be noted was the fact that the autocross in the 2007 competition was conducted in the parking lot of the racetrack. In 2008, the autocross event was conducted on the oval part of the NASCAR track on Turn 4. In 2008, there were a higher number of teams from across the United States. McGill University finished with the fastest time in the autocross competition as well as the endurance race. Dartmouth College's car finished fastest in both the unrestricted and electric-only acceleration runs. Illinois Institute of Technology was the only other team which completed the 40 lap endurance race. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University only managed to finish 32 laps while Drexel University managed to finish only 25 laps of the endurance race.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the 2008 competition, the official results were as follows:<ref>http://formula-hybrid.org/2008-scores-final.xls{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n1st Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[McGill University]]<br />\n2nd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]<br />\n3rd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]\n\n== 2009 Competition ==\nThe 2009 Formula Hybrid Competition was held for three days from May 4 to May 6 with the first day dedicated to technical inspections by SAE, IEEE and industry officials.

In the fully electric acceleration run the team are only allowed to utilize the power delivered by the electric system i.e., the accumulator pack (batteries or capacitors) and electric motor system.  In unlimited acceleration, the teams are free to use any system (or combination of systems) they wish.\n\n===Autocross event===\nThe autocross event involves an open loop circuit designed with chicanes, speed traps and slaloms. In 2007, the autocross competition was held in the parking lot next to the Turn 1 grandstands. In 2008 and 2009, the autocross competition was on a circuit built on the NASCAR oval track on turn 4. The competition event is designed to test the ability of the car to go around the circuit at maximum speed and drive around the tight bends and turns. The objective of the competition is to set the fastest time from the starting point and the ending point of the circuit.  As with [[Formula SAE]], the course is marked with orange traffic cones.  Hitting a cone incurs a 2 sec penalty, while failure to follow the course results in a 20 sec penalty.\n\n===Endurance event===\nThe endurance event is similar to the autocross track, except that it is closed loop and more spacious.  As with the auto-x event, the course is marked with traffic cones; hitting a cone incurs a 2 sec penalty and a failure to follow the course incurs a 20 sec penalty.  The Formula Hybrid cars are stipulated to drive a total of 22 kilometers in distance with one driver change pit stop at the half way mark. The pit stop can also be used to inspect minor details on the car by the team, but are not allowed any changes or allowed to add any fuel. The objective of the endurance race is to finish with the fastest race time while not running out of your allotted fuel.  McGill University repeated this feat in 2008 where the only other team to finish the 40-lap race was [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] which finished second.\n\nThe 2009 endurance course was longer than past years, there were only 24 total laps to cover the 22&nbsp;km distance, compared to 40 laps for 2008.  A total of 6 cars finished the 24 laps: [[Texas A&M University]] won, with [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly SLO]] second and [[Drexel University]] third.  The other three finishers were [[University of California Irvine]], [[Colorado State University]], and [[McGill University]], respectively.\n\n===Design event===\nThe Formula Hybrid competition includes an analysis and critique of the engineering design and construction of the vehicle, with an emphasis on drive train innovation, fuel efficiency, and sustainable manufacturing practices.\n\n== 2007 Competition ==\nThe 2007 Formula Hybrid Competition was organized in Loudon, New Hampshire at the New Hampshire International Speedway. A total of 6 teams participated in the competition. Though a bigger number of teams were registered for the competition, only these 6 teams were successful in getting a competitive car to the event. The six teams are the SAE teams from the universities of [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[McGill University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Florida Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]].\n\nThe inaugural competition had three events that were designed to judge the hybrid Formula car and their performance. The overall winner is determined by two categorical events \u2013 dynamic and static events. The static events included a technical inspection, a safety inspection and the official weighing of the formula cars. The dynamic events included an acceleration run, an autocross race and an endurance event. McGill University finished the fastest in autocross competition and also finished fastest in the endurance race. Yale University's car was the fastest in electric-only acceleration. Florida Institute of Technology's car was the fastest in the unrestricted acceleration event. Florida Institute of Technology, Illinois Institute of Technology and Yale University, represented their school's first entry into any Formula SAE competition.<ref name=\"formula-hybrid.com\">http://formula-hybrid.com/history/2007-results.php</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 competitions, the official results were as follows:<ref name=\"formula-hybrid.com\"/>\n\n1st Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[McGill University]] <br />\n2nd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] <br />\n3rd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Yale University]]\n\nBest Hybrid in Progress: [[Florida Institute of Technology]] <br />\nMost Innovative Design: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] <br />\nBest Hybrid Systems Engineering*: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]\n\nSpecial note * = Prize sponsored by DaimlerChrysler AG (before the split to [[Daimler AG]] and [[Chrysler]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]])\n\n== 2008 Competition ==\nThe 2008 Formula Hybrid Competition was organized in Loudon, New Hampshire at the New Hampshire International Speedway. Held for three days from May 5 to May 7, the competition saw the total number of registered teams increase to 15 teams; student teams from across the world like [[McGill University]] from Canada, [http://en.madi.ru/ MADI State Technical University from Russia] and National Chiao Tung University from Taiwan. A total of 12 teams arrived at the competition and 9 teams participated with a formula car on the track. The twelve teams were the SAE teams from the universities of [[Dartmouth College]], [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], [[University of Vermont]], [[McGill University]], [[North Carolina State University]], [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], [[Drexel University]], [[Florida Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://formula-hybrid.com/history/2008-competition.php</ref>\n\nThe second annual competition was conducted on the same competition pattern as in the 2007 competition (see above). The difference to be noted was the fact that the autocross in the 2007 competition was conducted in the parking lot of the racetrack. In 2008, the autocross event was conducted on the oval part of the NASCAR track on Turn 4. In 2008, there were a higher number of teams from across the United States. McGill University finished with the fastest time in the autocross competition as well as the endurance race. Dartmouth College's car finished fastest in both the unrestricted and electric-only acceleration runs. Illinois Institute of Technology was the only other team which completed the 40 lap endurance race. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University only managed to finish 32 laps while Drexel University managed to finish only 25 laps of the endurance race.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the 2008 competition, the official results were as follows:<ref>http://formula-hybrid.org/2008-scores-final.xls{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n1st Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[McGill University]]<br />\n2nd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]]<br />\n3rd Place Overall \u2013 Hybrid: [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]\n\n== 2009 Competition ==\nThe 2009 Formula Hybrid Competition was held for three days from May 4 to May 6 with the first day dedicated to technical inspections by SAE, IEEE and industry officials.

This made it impossible for Mercedes-Benz to use the engines from its previous Group C cars. Also, to produce similar power to the Group C cars a 3.5 litre naturally aspirated engine had to be very high-revving and be constructed from different materials in order to rev highly.\n\nUnlike Jaguar's [[XJR-14]] who had the readily available and proven Ford HB V8 engine from the [[Benetton B190B]] Formula One car (the engine regulations for the new 3.5 litre formula were identical to Formula One), Mercedes-Benz had to design an all-new purpose-built racing engine and its M-291 3.5L [[Flat-12]] unit was the result. The engine produced about {{Convert|550-600|bhp}}  compared to about {{Convert|730|bhp}} produced by 5.0 litre V8 twin turbo found in the C291's predecessor, the [[Mercedes-Benz C11]].\n\n==Design==\nUnlike the [[Jaguar XJR-14]], the C291 resembled previous sports-prototypes, despite the fact that the redesign of the Le Mans [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] in 1990 meant cars with their low drag design, top-end power, straight-line acceleration and top-speed characteristics were no longer required{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Unlike the Jaguar (and latterly the [[Peugeot 905]]B) the Mercedes still featured a full width low-drag single-tier rear wing and no front wing. This resulted in the car having a higher top speed than the Jaguar (and only slightly less than Group C cars).{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHowever, this, allied  to the characteristics of the 3.5 litre engine, meant the car would have slower acceleration above 150-170&nbsp;mph than most Group C cars, therefore not taking advantage of the low-drag design, and conversely the low-drag design meant the car was slower in the corners than the Jaguar and Peugeot's 905B, this time not taking advantage of the lower kerb weight of {{Convert|750|kg|lb|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\nOverall the C291 was not as fast as a contemporary Formula One car around some circuits used by the Grand Prix fraternity, and was a lot slower at Le Mans' Circuit de la Sarthe in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Race results==\nDuring the development and testing of the new M291 powerplant, it became apparent to Sauber Mercedes that there were problems in the engine design and construction. Thus the team started the 1991 season with a lone C291, while at the same time running an older C11. In the first two races of the season, the C291 failed to finish while the C11 finished 2nd and 3rd. At the third race, the C291 scored a 2nd-place finish, ahead of the C11. For the fourth round, the [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the team decided that the C291 would not be capable of completing the race, and thus were forced to enter three C11s.\n\nAfter Le Mans, Sauber Mercedes decided that the C291 had been developed enough to compete on its own, and it finished the season without running a C11 alongside. However, the C291 failed to finish the next three races of the season. Only in the final race of the year at Autopolis was the C291 not only able to finish, but also able to score its only win. Sauber Mercedes finished the season third in the teams championship.\n\nAfter much disappointment the C291 was planned to be replaced by the more radical [[Mercedes-Benz C292|C292]] for the 1992 season, but Mercedes-Benz decided to pull out of sportscar racing before the C292 could compete and turned to Formula 1 in 1993, although it did not continue to use the troublesome M291 powerplant.\n\n==Complete World Sportscar Championship results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

This resulted in the car having a higher top speed than the Jaguar (and only slightly less than Group C cars).{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHowever, this, allied  to the characteristics of the 3.5 litre engine, meant the car would have slower acceleration above 150-170&nbsp;mph than most Group C cars, therefore not taking advantage of the low-drag design, and conversely the low-drag design meant the car was slower in the corners than the Jaguar and Peugeot\u2019s 905B, this time not taking advantage of the lower kerb weight of {{Convert|750|kg|lb|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\nOverall the C291 was not as fast as a contemporary Formula One car around some circuits used by the Grand Prix fraternity, and was a lot slower at Le Mans' Circuit de la Sarthe in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Race results==\nDuring the development and testing of the new M291 powerplant, it became apparent to Sauber Mercedes that there were problems in the engine design and construction. Thus the team started the 1991 season with a lone C291, while at the same time running an older C11. In the first two races of the season, the C291 failed to finish while the C11 finished 2nd and 3rd. At the third race, the C291 scored a 2nd-place finish, ahead of the C11. For the fourth round, the [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the team decided that the C291 would not be capable of completing the race, and thus were forced to enter three C11s.\n\nAfter Le Mans, Sauber Mercedes decided that the C291 had been developed enough to compete on its own, and it finished the season without running a C11 alongside. However, the C291 failed to finish the next three races of the season. Only in the final race of the year at Autopolis was the C291 not only able to finish, but also able to score its only win. Sauber Mercedes finished the season third in the teams championship.\n\nAfter much disappointment the C291 was planned to be replaced by the more radical [[Mercedes-Benz C292|C292]] for the 1992 season, but Mercedes-Benz decided to pull out of sportscar racing before the C292 could compete and turned to Formula 1 in 1993, although it did not continue to use the troublesome M291 powerplant.\n\n==Complete World Sportscar Championship results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

''Split'' is noted as the first solo [[supervillain]] origin movie. It is also Shyamalan's first sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', was released in January&nbsp;2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}Casey Cooke is a withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John. After being invited to a birthday party out of pity, she accepts a ride home from her classmate Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), knocks Claire's father unconscious before kidnapping them.\n\nKevin is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities and found that Kevin's physiology changes with each. In Kevin's mind, they sit in chairs in a room, waiting for \"Barry,\" the dominant, to grant them their turn \"in the light.\" Recently, \"Barry\" has refused \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have their turns due to \"Dennis's\" tendency to bother young girls and \"Patricia's\" undesirable traits and their worship for \"The Beast,\" an entity who plans to rid the world of the \"impure\". Fletcher has also found that she can bring back Kevin's own personality by speaking his full name.\n\nKevin, as \"Dennis,\" locks the girls in a cell in his underground quarters. They recognize his DID, and Claire attempts to use this to escape but is caught and separated from the others. Kevin continues going to work and attending appointments with Fletcher. Fletcher soon recognizes \"Dennis\" has displaced \"Barry\" as the dominant personality.\n\nIt is revealed that when Kevin was a child, his father [[Unbreakable (film)|left on a train one day and never returned]]. As he grew up, Kevin's mother, who suffered from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] (OCD), physically abused him. He recently experienced an incident with two teenage girls who forced him to touch their breasts, which Fletcher believes triggered \"Dennis\" to take over.\n\nMarcia attempts to escape but is caught by \"Patricia\" and separated from Casey. Casey befriends \"Hedwig,\" another one of Kevin's personalities that is a 9-year-old boy, who reveals himself as the one to have taken control of \"the light\" from \"Barry.\" Casey convinces \"Hedwig\" to let her out of her cell to see his bedroom, believing that there might be a means of escape through the window \"Hedwig\" has described in that room, but she finds that it is only a drawing of a window. She takes a walkie-talkie from Hedwig and uses it to call for help, but the man at the other end thinks it is a prank. \"Patricia\" takes over and subdues Casey.\n\nFletcher visits Kevin's home, where he reveals that he has met \"The Beast,\" in actuality a yet-to-manifest 24th personality. Realizing that \"Dennis\" may have abducted the three missing girls to serve as a sacrifice to \"The Beast,\" Fletcher feigns going to the bathroom, searches Kevin's living quarters, and finds Claire. \"Dennis\" suddenly appears, sedates Fletcher, and locks her up as well.\n\n\"Dennis\" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows \"The Beast\" to finally take over, giving Kevin superhuman abilities. Fletcher writes Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before \"The Beast\" arrives and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that \"The Beast\" has already [[Human cannibalism|devoured]] Marcia and watches in horror as he eats Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. \"The Beast\" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.\n\nThis prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control of \"the light,\" and \"Hedwig\" is the victor. Casey is told that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. \"Hedwig\" gives control over to the undesirable personalities \u2014 \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\" \u2014 so nobody will ever make fun of him again, and they once again let \"The Beast\" take hold. Casey retrieves the gun and ammunition before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots \"The Beast\" twice to no effect. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars \"The Beast\" begins to pull apart. He sees faded self-harm scars across her body, considers Casey to be \"pure\" and more evolved due to her being \"broken,\" and spares her.\n\nCasey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. When Casey is asked if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she hesitates to answer. In another hideout, \"Dennis,\" \"Patricia,\" and \"Hedwig\" discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world.\n\nIn a diner, several patrons watch a news report on Kevin's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]''.}} As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], says it was \"[[Glass (2019 film)|Mr. Glass]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Horde: a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder (DID), who has 23&nbsp;prominent personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives. Kevin's body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in his 24th and final personality, \"The Beast\": a grotesque and cannibalistic sociopath with superhuman capabilities, such as inhuman bodily strength, enhanced speed and agility, along with near-invulnerability and unnatural mobility, to the point of being able to scale walls and ceilings, but resulting in his insatiable hunger for raw human flesh.\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Casey Cooke, a teenage girl with a traumatic past and a history of [[self-harm]], who is kidnapped by \"Dennis\", one of Kevin's personalities, to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n**Izzie Coffey as 5&nbsp;year-old Casey\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Karen Fletcher, a [[psychologist]] who attempts to help Kevin with his DID, and believes that DID can, in extreme cases, cause physiological changes.\n* [[Haley Lu Richardson]] as Claire Benoit, Mr.&nbsp;Benoit's daughter, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Marcia, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Jessica Sula]] as Marcia, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Claire, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as John Cooke, Casey's paternal uncle.\n* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Mr. Cooke, Casey's father.\n* [[Neal Huff]] as Mr. Benoit, Claire's father.\n* [[Kim Director]] as Hannah.\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as academic moderator.\n* [[M.

He explained, \"In this case I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me. It sat there for a long time, and I really don't have a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier. But this felt like the perfect time to do it, with the type of movies I'm doing now, and the type of tones I am interested in \u2013 humor and suspense.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=McKittrick |first=Christopher |title='Power comes from writing.'

An article from [[CNN]] stated that [[mental health]] advocates warn that the film stigmatizes [[dissociative identity disorder]] and may directly impact those living with it. \"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate [[symptoms]] in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" [[Psychiatrist]] Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's [[Icahn School of Medicine]], said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of [[mental illness]] that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]], she said. Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nedelman |first1=Michael |title=What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=42}}</ref> In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in [[jail]] over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cWhat concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[Mental disorder|disorder]] that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering \u2014 the [[abuse]] of innocent children,\u201d Itzkowitz told [[Healthline]]. He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don\u2019t know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories \u201cvilify and demonize [[mental illness]] in general, and DID in particular,\u201d the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.

''Split'' is noted as the first solo [[supervillain]] origin movie. It is also Shyamalan's first sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', was released in January&nbsp;2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}Casey Cooke is a withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John. After being invited to a birthday party out of pity, she accepts a ride home from her classmate Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), knocks Claire's father unconscious before kidnapping them.\n\nKevin is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities and found that Kevin's physiology changes with each. In Kevin's mind, they sit in chairs in a room, waiting for \"Barry,\" the dominant, to grant them their turn \"in the light.\" Recently, \"Barry\" has refused \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have their turns due to \"Dennis's\" tendency to bother young girls and \"Patricia's\" undesirable traits and their worship for \"The Beast,\" an entity who plans to rid the world of the \"impure\". Fletcher has also found that she can bring back Kevin's own personality by speaking his full name.\n\nKevin, as \"Dennis,\" locks the girls in a cell in his underground quarters. They recognize his DID, and Claire attempts to use this to escape but is caught and separated from the others. Kevin continues going to work and attending appointments with Fletcher. Fletcher soon recognizes \"Dennis\" has displaced \"Barry\" as the dominant personality.\n\nIt is revealed that when Kevin was a child, his father [[Unbreakable (film)|left on a train one day and never returned]]. As he grew up, Kevin's mother, who suffered from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] (OCD), physically abused him. He recently experienced an incident with two teenage girls who forced him to touch their breasts, which Fletcher believes triggered \"Dennis\" to take over.\n\nMarcia attempts to escape but is caught by \"Patricia\" and separated from Casey. Casey befriends \"Hedwig,\" another one of Kevin's personalities that is a 9-year-old boy, who reveals himself as the one to have taken control of \"the light\" from \"Barry.\" Casey convinces \"Hedwig\" to let her out of her cell to see his bedroom, believing that there might be a means of escape through the window \"Hedwig\" has described in that room, but she finds that it is only a drawing of a window. She takes a walkie-talkie from Hedwig and uses it to call for help, but the man at the other end thinks it is a prank. \"Patricia\" takes over and subdues Casey.\n\nFletcher visits Kevin's home, where he reveals that he has met \"The Beast,\" in actuality a yet-to-manifest 24th personality. Realizing that \"Dennis\" may have abducted the three missing girls to serve as a sacrifice to \"The Beast,\" Fletcher feigns going to the bathroom, searches Kevin's living quarters, and finds Claire. \"Dennis\" suddenly appears, sedates Fletcher, and locks her up as well.\n\n\"Dennis\" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows \"The Beast\" to finally take over, giving Kevin superhuman abilities. Fletcher writes Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before \"The Beast\" arrives and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that \"The Beast\" has already [[Human cannibalism|devoured]] Marcia and watches in horror as he eats Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. \"The Beast\" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.\n\nThis prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control of \"the light,\" and \"Hedwig\" is the victor. Casey is told that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. \"Hedwig\" gives control over to the undesirable personalities \u2014 \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\" \u2014 so nobody will ever make fun of him again, and they once again let \"The Beast\" take hold. Casey retrieves the gun and ammunition before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots \"The Beast\" twice to no effect. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars \"The Beast\" begins to pull apart. He sees faded self-harm scars across her body, considers Casey to be \"pure\" and more evolved due to her being \"broken,\" and spares her.\n\nCasey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. When Casey is asked if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she hesitates to answer. In another hideout, \"Dennis,\" \"Patricia,\" and \"Hedwig\" discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world.\n\nIn a diner, several patrons watch a news report on Kevin's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]''.}} As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], says it was \"[[Glass (2019 film)|Mr. Glass]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Horde: a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder (DID), who has 23&nbsp;prominent personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives. Kevin's body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in his 24th and final personality, \"The Beast\": a grotesque and cannibalistic sociopath with superhuman capabilities, such as inhuman bodily strength, enhanced speed and agility, along with near-invulnerability and unnatural mobility, to the point of being able to scale walls and ceilings, but resulting in his insatiable hunger for raw human flesh.\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Casey Cooke, a teenage girl with a traumatic past and a history of [[self-harm]], who is kidnapped by \"Dennis\", one of Kevin's personalities, to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n**Izzie Coffey as 5&nbsp;year-old Casey\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Karen Fletcher, a [[psychologist]] who attempts to help Kevin with his DID, and believes that DID can, in extreme cases, cause physiological changes.\n* [[Haley Lu Richardson]] as Claire Benoit, Mr.&nbsp;Benoit's daughter, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Marcia, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Jessica Sula]] as Marcia, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Claire, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as John Cooke, Casey's paternal uncle.\n* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Mr. Cooke, Casey's father.\n* [[Neal Huff]] as Mr. Benoit, Claire's father.\n* [[Kim Director]] as Hannah.\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as academic moderator.\n* [[M.

He explained, \"In this case I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me. It sat there for a long time, and I really don't have a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier. But this felt like the perfect time to do it, with the type of movies I'm doing now, and the type of tones I am interested in \u2013 humor and suspense.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=McKittrick |first=Christopher |title='Power comes from writing.'

An article from [[CNN]] stated that [[mental health]] advocates warn that the film stigmatizes [[dissociative identity disorder]] and may directly impact those living with it. \"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate [[symptoms]] in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" [[Psychiatrist]] Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's [[Icahn School of Medicine]], said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of [[mental illness]] that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]], she said. Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nedelman |first1=Michael |title=What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=42}}</ref> In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in [[jail]] over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cWhat concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[disorder]] that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering \u2014 the [[abuse]] of innocent children,\u201d Itzkowitz told [[Healthline]]. He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don\u2019t know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories \u201cvilify and demonize [[mental illness]] in general, and DID in particular,\u201d the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.

{"title_page": "PowerVR", "text_new": "'''PowerVR''' is a division of [[Imagination Technologies]] (formerly VideoLogic) that develops hardware and software for 2D and [[3D rendering]], and for [[video encoding]], [[video decoding|decoding]], associated [[image processing]] and [[DirectX]], [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenVG]], and [[OpenCL]] acceleration. PowerVR also develops [[AI accelerator]]s called Neural Network Accelerator (NNA).\n\nThe PowerVR product line was originally introduced to compete in the desktop PC market for [[Graphics card|3D hardware accelerators]] with a product with a better [[price\u2013performance ratio]] than existing products like those from [[3dfx Interactive]]. Rapid changes in that market, notably with the introduction of [[OpenGL]] and [[Direct3D]], led to rapid consolidation. PowerVR introduced new versions with [[low-power electronics]] that were aimed at the [[laptop computer]] market. Over time, this developed into a series of designs that could be incorporated into [[system-on-a-chip]] architectures suitable for [[handheld device]] use.\n\nPowerVR accelerators are not manufactured by PowerVR, but instead their [[integrated circuit]] designs and [[patent]]s are licensed to other companies, such as [[Texas Instruments]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Renesas Electronics|Renesas]], [[Samsung]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Freescale]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors)]], and many others.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe PowerVR chipset uses a method of 3D rendering known as ''[[tile-based deferred rendering]]'' (often abbreviated as TBDR) which is tile-based rendering combined with PowerVR's proprietary method of Hidden Surface Removal (HSR) and Hierarchical Scheduling Technology (HST). As the polygon generating program feeds triangles to the PowerVR (driver), it stores them in memory in a [[triangle strip]] or an indexed format. Unlike other architectures, polygon rendering is (usually) not performed until all polygon information has been collated for the current [[Video frame|frame]]. Furthermore, the expensive operations of texturing and shading of pixels (or fragments) is delayed, whenever possible, until the visible surface at a pixel is determined \u2014 hence rendering is deferred.\n\nIn order to render, the display is split into rectangular sections in a grid pattern. Each section is known as a tile. Associated with each tile is a list of the triangles that visibly overlap that tile. Each tile is rendered in turn to produce the final image.\n\nTiles are rendered using a process similar to [[ray-casting]]. Rays are numerically simulated as if cast onto the triangles associated with the tile and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. The PowerVR hardware typically calculates the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle.{{dubious|date=April 2013}}\n\nThis method has the advantage that, unlike a more traditional early Z rejection based hierarchical systems, no calculations need to be made to determine what a polygon looks like in an area where it is obscured by other geometry. It also allows for correct rendering of partially transparent polygons, independent of the order in which they are processed by the polygon producing application. (This capability was only implemented in Series 2 including Dreamcast and one MBX variant. It is generally not included for lack of API support and cost reasons.)\nMore importantly, as the rendering is limited to one tile at a time, the whole tile can be in fast on-chip memory, which is flushed to video memory before processing the next tile. Under normal circumstances, each tile is visited just once per frame.\n\nPowerVR is a pioneer of tile based deferred rendering. Microsoft also conceptualized the idea with their abandoned [[Microsoft Talisman|Talisman]] project. Gigapixel, a company that developed IP for tile-based 3D graphics, was purchased by [[3dfx]], which in turn was subsequently purchased by [[Nvidia]]. Nvidia has now been shown to use tile rendering in the Maxwell and Pascal microarchitectures for a limited amount of geometry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/10536/nvidia-maxwell-tile-rasterization-analysis|title=Hidden Secrets: Investigation Shows That NVIDIA GPUs Implement Tile Based Rasterization for Greater Efficiency|first=Ryan|last=Smith|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref>\n\n[[ARM Holdings|ARM]] began developing another major tile based architecture known as [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]] after their acquisition of [[Falanx]].\n\nIntel uses a similar concept in their integrated graphics products. However, its method, called zone rendering, does not perform full [[hidden surface removal]] (HSR) and deferred texturing, therefore wasting fillrate and texture bandwidth on pixels that are not visible in the final image.\n\nRecent advances in hierarchical Z-buffering have effectively incorporated ideas previously only used in deferred rendering, including the idea of being able to split a scene into tiles and of potentially being able to accept or reject tile sized pieces of polygon.\n\nToday, the PowerVR software and hardware suite has ASICs for [[video encoding]], [[video decoding|decoding]] and associated [[image processing]]. It also has virtualisation, and [[Direct X|DirectX]], [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenVG]], and [[OpenCL]] acceleration.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/02/texas-instruments-announces-multi-core-1-8ghz-omap4470-arm-proc/ Texas Instruments announces multi-core, 1.8GHz OMAP4470 ARM processor for Windows 8], By Amar Toor, June 2, 2011, Engadget</ref>\nNewest PowerVR Wizard GPUs have [[graphics pipeline|fixed-function]] [[Ray-tracing hardware|Ray Tracing]] Unit (RTU) hardware and support hybrid rendering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/graphics-processors/|title=PowerVR - embedded graphics processors powering iconic products}}</ref>\n\n==PowerVR Graphics==\n{{See also|List of PowerVR products}}\n\n===Series1 (NEC)===\n[[File:VideoLogic Apocalypse 3Dx.jpg|thumb|VideoLogic Apocalypse 3Dx (NEC PowerVR PCX2 chip)]]\n[[File:NEC D62011GD (PowerVR PCX2).png|thumb|NEC D62011GD (PowerVR PCX2)]]\nThe first series of PowerVR cards was mostly designed as 3D-only accelerator boards that would use the main 2D video card's memory as framebuffer over PCI.

There was also the Videologic Apocalypse 5D Sonic, which combined the PCX2 accelerator with a [[Tseng Labs|Tseng]] ET6100 2D core and ESS Agogo sound on a single PCI board.\n\nThe PowerVR PCX cards were placed in the market as budget products and performed well in the games of their time, but weren't quite as fully featured as the [[3DFX Voodoo]] accelerators (due to certain blending modes being unavailable, for instance). However, the PowerVR approach of rendering to the 2D card's memory meant that much higher 3D rendering resolutions could be possible in theory, especially with PowerSGL games that took full advantage of the hardware.\n\n* All models support [[DirectX]] 3.0 and PowerSGL, MiniGL drivers available for select games\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Model\n!rowspan=2|Launch\n!rowspan=2|Fab ([[nanometer|nm]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory ([[Mebibyte|MiB]])\n!rowspan=2|Core clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Core config<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=4|[[Fillrate]]\n!colspan=3|Memory\n|-\n!MOperations/s\n!MPixels/s\n!MTexels/s\n!MPolygons/s\n!Bandwidth ([[Gigabyte|GB]]/s)\n!Bus type\n!Bus width ([[bit]])\n|-\n!Midas3\n|1996\n|?\n|2\n|66\n|66\n|1:1\n|66\n|66\n|66\n|0\n|0.24<sup>2</sup>\n|SDR+FPM<sup>2</sup>\n|32+16<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n!PCX1\n|1996\n|500\n|4\n|60\n|60\n|1:1\n|60\n|60\n|60\n|0\n|0.48\n|SDR\n|64\n|-\n!PCX2\n|1997\n|350\n|4\n|66\n|66\n|1:1\n|66\n|66\n|66\n|0\n|0.528\n|SDR\n|64\n|-\n|}\n\n* <sup>1</sup> [[Texture mapping unit]]s: [[render output unit]]s\n*<sup>2</sup> Midas3 is 3-chip (vs. single-chip PCX series) and uses a split memory architecture: 1 MB 32-bit SDRAM (240 MB/s peak bandwidth) for textures and 1 MB 16-bit FPM DRAM for geometry data (and presumably for PCI communication).

As part of an internal competition at [[Sega]] to design the successor to the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], the PowerVR2 was licensed to NEC and was chosen ahead of a rival design based on the [[3dfx]] [[Voodoo 2]].

The architecture was redesigned for better game compatibility and expanded to a dual-pipeline design for more performance. The refresh STM PowerVR3 KYRO II, released later in the same year, likely had a lengthened pipeline to attain higher clock speeds<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/735|title=STMicroelectronics Kyro II 64MB|first=Matthew|last=Witheiler|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref> and was able to rival the more expensive ATI [[Radeon]] DDR and NVIDIA [[GeForce 2]] GTS in some benchmarks of the time, despite its modest specifications on paper and lack of hardware [[transform and lighting]] (T&L), a fact that Nvidia especially tried to capitalize on in a confidential paper they sent out to reviewers.<ref>http://dumpster.hardwaretidende.dk/dokumenter/nvidia_on_kyro.pdf</ref> As games increasingly started to include more geometry with this feature in mind, the KYRO II lost its competitiveness.\n\nThe KYRO series had a decent featureset for a budget-oriented GPU in their time, including a few Direct3D 8.1-compliant features such as 8-layer multitexturing (not 8-pass) and Environment Mapped Bump Mapping (EMBM); Full Scene Anti-Aliasing (FSAA) and Trilinear/Anisotropic filtering were also present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/imagination-technologies-powervr-in-stmicroelectronics-kyro-pc-graphics-accelerator-unveiled/|title=Imagination Technologies\u2019 PowerVR\u2122 in STMicroelectronics\u2019 KYRO\u2122 PC Graphics Accelerator Unveiled}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/stmicrolectronics-announces-next-generation-kyro-ii-3d-graphics-accelerator/|title=STMicrolectronics announces next generation KYRO II \u2122 3D Graphics Accelerator}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/powervr-technologies-debuts-kyro-ii-se-graphics-processor-at-cebit-2002/|title=PowerVR Technologies Debuts KYRO II SE\u2122 Graphics Processor at CeBIT 2002}}</ref> KYRO II could also perform Dot Product (Dot3) Bump Mapping at a similar speed as GeForce 2 GTS in benchmarks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202062747/https://aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=25000237|title=Ace's Hardware|date=February 2, 2002|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Omissions included hardware T&L (an optional feature in Direct3D 7), Cube Environment Mapping and legacy 8-bit paletted texture support.

However, due to its unique concept on the market, the architecture could sometimes exhibit flaws such as missing geometry in games, and therefore the driver had a notable amount of compatibility settings, such as switching off the internal Z-buffer. These settings could cause a negative impact on performance.\n\nA second refresh of the KYRO was planned for 2002, the STG4800 KYRO II SE. Samples of this card were sent to reviewers but it does not appear to have been brought to market. Apart from a clockspeed boost, this refresh was announced with a \"EnT&L\" HW T&L software emulation, which eventually made it into the drivers for the previous KYRO cards starting with version 2.0. The STG5500 KYRO III, based upon the next-generation '''PowerVR4''', was completed and would have included hardware T&L but was shelved due to STMicro closing its graphics division.\n\n* All models support [[DirectX]] 6.0\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Model\n!rowspan=2|Launch\n!rowspan=2|Fab ([[nanometer|nm]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory ([[Mebibyte|MiB]])\n!rowspan=2|Core clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Core config<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=4|[[Fillrate]]\n!colspan=3|Memory\n|-\n!MOperations/s\n!MPixels/s\n!MTexels/s\n!MPolygons/s\n!Bandwidth ([[Gigabyte|GB]]/s)\n!Bus type\n!Bus width ([[bit]])\n|-\n!STG4000 KYRO\n|2001\n|250\n|32/64\n|115\n|115\n|2:2\n|230\n|230\n|230\n|0\n|1.84\n|SDR\n|128\n|-\n!STG4500 KYRO II\n|2001\n|180\n|32/64\n|175\n|175\n|2:2\n|350\n|350\n|350\n|0\n|2.8\n|SDR\n|128\n|-\n!STG4800 KYRO II SE\n|2002\n|180\n|64\n|200\n|200\n|2:2\n|400\n|400\n|400\n|0\n|3.2\n|SDR\n|128\n|-\n!STG5500 KYRO III\n|Never Released\n|130\n|64\n|250\n|250\n|4:4\n|1000\n|1000\n|1000\n|0\n|8\n|DDR\n|128\n|-\n|}\n\n* <sup>1</sup> [[Texture mapping unit]]s: [[render output unit]]s\n\n===Series4 (STMicro)===\nPowerVR achieved great success in the mobile graphics market with its low power '''PowerVR MBX'''.

companies]]\n[[Category:Graphics processing units]]\n[[Category:Video cards]]\n", "text_old": "'''PowerVR''' is a division of [[Imagination Technologies]] (formerly VideoLogic) that develops hardware and software for 2D and [[3D rendering]], and for [[video encoding]], [[video decoding|decoding]], associated [[image processing]] and [[DirectX]], [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenVG]], and [[OpenCL]] acceleration. PowerVR also develops [[AI accelerator]]s called Neural Network Accelerator (NNA).\n\nThe PowerVR product line was originally introduced to compete in the desktop PC market for [[Graphics card|3D hardware accelerators]] with a product with a better [[price\u2013performance ratio]] than existing products like those from [[3dfx Interactive]]. Rapid changes in that market, notably with the introduction of [[OpenGL]] and [[Direct3D]], led to rapid consolidation. PowerVR introduced new versions with [[low-power electronics]] that were aimed at the [[laptop computer]] market. Over time, this developed into a series of designs that could be incorporated into [[system-on-a-chip]] architectures suitable for [[handheld device]] use.\n\nPowerVR accelerators are not manufactured by PowerVR, but instead their [[integrated circuit]] designs and [[patent]]s are licensed to other companies, such as [[Texas Instruments]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Renesas Electronics|Renesas]], [[Samsung]], [[STMicroelectronics]], [[Freescale]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors)]], and many others.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe PowerVR chipset uses a method of 3D rendering known as ''[[tile-based deferred rendering]]'' (often abbreviated as TBDR) which is tile-based rendering combined with PowerVR's proprietary method of Hidden Surface Removal (HSR) and Hierarchical Scheduling Technology (HST). As the polygon generating program feeds triangles to the PowerVR (driver), it stores them in memory in a [[triangle strip]] or an indexed format. Unlike other architectures, polygon rendering is (usually) not performed until all polygon information has been collated for the current [[Video frame|frame]]. Furthermore, the expensive operations of texturing and shading of pixels (or fragments) is delayed, whenever possible, until the visible surface at a pixel is determined \u2014 hence rendering is deferred.\n\nIn order to render, the display is split into rectangular sections in a grid pattern. Each section is known as a tile. Associated with each tile is a list of the triangles that visibly overlap that tile. Each tile is rendered in turn to produce the final image.\n\nTiles are rendered using a process similar to [[ray-casting]]. Rays are numerically simulated as if cast onto the triangles associated with the tile and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. The PowerVR hardware typically calculates the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle.{{dubious|date=April 2013}}\n\nThis method has the advantage that , unlike a more traditional early Z rejection based hierarchical systems, no calculations need to be made to determine what a polygon looks like in an area where it is obscured by other geometry. It also allows for correct rendering of partially transparent polygons, independent of the order in which they are processed by the polygon producing application. (This capability was only implemented in Series 2 including Dreamcast and one MBX variant. It is generally not included for lack of API support and cost reasons.)\nMore importantly, as the rendering is limited to one tile at a time, the whole tile can be in fast on-chip memory, which is flushed to video memory before processing the next tile. Under normal circumstances, each tile is visited just once per frame.\n\nPowerVR is a pioneer of tile based deferred rendering. Microsoft also conceptualized the idea with their abandoned [[Microsoft Talisman|Talisman]] project. Gigapixel, a company that developed IP for tile-based 3D graphics, was purchased by [[3dfx]], which in turn was subsequently purchased by [[Nvidia]]. Nvidia has now been shown to use tile rendering in the Maxwell and Pascal microarchitectures for a limited amount of geometry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/10536/nvidia-maxwell-tile-rasterization-analysis|title=Hidden Secrets: Investigation Shows That NVIDIA GPUs Implement Tile Based Rasterization for Greater Efficiency|first=Ryan|last=Smith|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref>\n\n[[ARM Holdings|ARM]] began developing another major tile based architecture known as [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]] after their acquisition of [[Falanx]].\n\nIntel uses a similar concept in their integrated graphics products. However, its method, called zone rendering, does not perform full [[hidden surface removal]] (HSR) and deferred texturing, therefore wasting fillrate and texture bandwidth on pixels that are not visible in the final image.\n\nRecent advances in hierarchical Z-buffering have effectively incorporated ideas previously only used in deferred rendering, including the idea of being able to split a scene into tiles and of potentially being able to accept or reject tile sized pieces of polygon.\n\nToday, the PowerVR software and hardware suite has ASICs for [[video encoding]], [[video decoding|decoding]] and associated [[image processing]]. It also has virtualisation, and [[Direct X|DirectX]], [[OpenGL ES]], [[OpenVG]], and [[OpenCL]] acceleration.<ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/02/texas-instruments-announces-multi-core-1-8ghz-omap4470-arm-proc/ Texas Instruments announces multi-core, 1.8GHz OMAP4470 ARM processor for Windows 8], By Amar Toor, June 2, 2011, Engadget</ref>\nNewest PowerVR Wizard GPUs have [[graphics pipeline|fixed-function]] [[Ray-tracing hardware|Ray Tracing]] Unit (RTU) hardware and support hybrid rendering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/graphics-processors/|title=PowerVR - embedded graphics processors powering iconic products}}</ref>\n\n==PowerVR Graphics==\n{{See also|List of PowerVR products}}\n\n===Series1 (NEC)===\n[[File:VideoLogic Apocalypse 3Dx.jpg|thumb|VideoLogic Apocalypse 3Dx (NEC PowerVR PCX2 chip)]]\n[[File:NEC D62011GD (PowerVR PCX2).png|thumb|NEC D62011GD (PowerVR PCX2)]]\nThe first series of PowerVR cards was mostly designed as 3D-only accelerator boards that would use the main 2D video card's memory as framebuffer over PCI. Videologic's first PowerVR PC product to market was the 3-chip Midas3, which saw very limited availability in some OEM [[Compaq]] PCs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Compaq Selects PowerVR 3D Graphics Architecture for Next- Generation, High-Performance Presarios Home PCs|url=http://www.pure.com/press-release/compaq-selects-powervr-3d-graphics-architecture-for-next-generation-high-performance-presarios-home-pcs-7/|publisher=Imagination Technologies Limited|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=VideoLogic Targets PC OEMs with PowerVR 3D Accelerator Card|url=http://www.pure.com/press-release/videologic-targets-pc-oems-with-powervr-3d-accelerator-card-8/|publisher=Imagination Technologies Limited}}</ref> This card had very poor compatibility with all but the first Direct3D games, and even most SGL games did not run.

This was followed by the further refined PCX2, which clocked 6&nbsp;MHz higher, offloaded some driver work by including more chip functionality<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/blog/back-to-the-start-powervr-25/|title=Back to the start: PowerVR 25|date=August 23, 2017}}</ref> and added bilinear filtering, and was released in retail on the Matrox M3D<ref>{{cite web|title=Matrox Graphics Inc.

There was also the Videologic Apocalypse 5D Sonic, which combined the PCX2 accelerator with a [[Tseng Labs|Tseng]] ET6100 2D core and ESS Agogo sound on a single PCI board.\n\nThe PowerVR PCX cards were placed in the market as budget products and performed well in the games of their time, but weren't quite as fully featured as the [[3DFX Voodoo]] accelerators (due to certain blending modes being unavailable, for instance). However, the PowerVR approach of rendering to the 2D card's memory meant that much higher 3D rendering resolutions could be possible in theory, especially with PowerSGL games that took full advantage of the hardware.\n\n* All models support [[DirectX]] 3.0 and PowerSGL, MiniGL drivers available for select games\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Model\n!rowspan=2|Launch\n!rowspan=2|Fab ([[nanometer|nm]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory ([[Mebibyte|MiB]])\n!rowspan=2|Core clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Core config<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=4|[[Fillrate]]\n!colspan=3|Memory\n|-\n!MOperations/s\n!MPixels/s\n!MTexels/s\n!MPolygons/s\n!Bandwidth ([[Gigabyte|GB]]/s)\n!Bus type\n!Bus width ([[bit]])\n|-\n!Midas3\n|1996\n|?\n|2\n|66\n|66\n|1:1\n|66\n|66\n|66\n|0\n|0.24<sup>2</sup>\n|SDR+FPM<sup>2</sup>\n|32+16<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n!PCX1\n|1996\n|500\n|4\n|60\n|60\n|1:1\n|60\n|60\n|60\n|0\n|0.48\n|SDR\n|64\n|-\n!PCX2\n|1997\n|350\n|4\n|66\n|66\n|1:1\n|66\n|66\n|66\n|0\n|0.528\n|SDR\n|64\n|-\n|}\n\n* <sup>1</sup> [[Texture mapping unit]]s: [[render output unit]]s\n*<sup>2</sup> Midas3 is 3-chip (vs. single-chip PCX series) and uses a split memory architecture: 1 MB 32-bit SDRAM (240 MB/s peak bandwidth) for textures and 1 MB 16-bit FPM DRAM for geometry data (and presumably for PCI communication).

The refresh STM PowerVR3 KYRO II, released later in the same year, likely had a lengthened pipeline to attain higher clock speeds<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/735|title=STMicroelectronics Kyro II 64MB|first=Matthew|last=Witheiler|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref> and was able to rival the more expensive ATI [[Radeon]] DDR and NVIDIA [[GeForce 2]] GTS in some benchmarks of the time, despite its modest specifications on paper and lack of hardware [[transform and lighting]] (T&L), a fact that Nvidia especially tried to capitalize on in a confidential paper they sent out to reviewers.<ref>http://dumpster.hardwaretidende.dk/dokumenter/nvidia_on_kyro.pdf</ref> As games increasingly started to include more geometry with this feature in mind, the KYRO II lost its competitiveness.\n\nThe KYRO series had a decent featureset for a budget-oriented GPU in their time, including a few Direct3D 8.1-compliant features such as 8-layer multitexturing (not 8-pass) and Environment Mapped Bump Mapping (EMBM); Full Scene Anti-Aliasing (FSAA) and Trilinear/Anisotropic filtering were also present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/imagination-technologies-powervr-in-stmicroelectronics-kyro-pc-graphics-accelerator-unveiled/|title=Imagination Technologies\u2019 PowerVR\u2122 in STMicroelectronics\u2019 KYRO\u2122 PC Graphics Accelerator Unveiled}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/stmicrolectronics-announces-next-generation-kyro-ii-3d-graphics-accelerator/|title=STMicrolectronics announces next generation KYRO II \u2122 3D Graphics Accelerator}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imgtec.com/news/press-release/powervr-technologies-debuts-kyro-ii-se-graphics-processor-at-cebit-2002/|title=PowerVR Technologies Debuts KYRO II SE\u2122 Graphics Processor at CeBIT 2002}}</ref> KYRO II could also perform Dot Product (Dot3) Bump Mapping at a similar speed as GeForce 2 GTS in benchmarks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020202062747/https://aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=25000237|title=Ace's Hardware|date=February 2, 2002|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Omissions included hardware T&L (an optional feature in Direct3D 7), Cube Environment Mapping and legacy 8-bit paletted texture support. While the chip supported [[S3TC]]/DXTC texture compression, only the (most commonly used) DXT1 format was supported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beyond3d.com/content/reviews/13/4|title=Beyond3D - Imagination Technologies Videologic Vivid! 32MB KYRO|website=www.beyond3d.com}}</ref> Support for the proprietary PowerSGL API was also dropped with this series.\n\n16-bit output quality was excellent compared to most of its competitors, thanks to rendering to its internal 32-bit tile cache and downsampling to 16-bit instead of straight use of a 16-bit framebuffer.<ref>https://www.vogons.org/download/file.php?id=20346</ref> This could play a role in improving performance without losing much image quality, as memory bandwidth was not plentiful. However, due to its unique concept on the market, the architecture could sometimes exhibit flaws such as missing geometry in games, and therefore the driver had a notable amount of compatibility settings, such as switching off the internal Z-buffer. These settings could cause a negative impact on performance.\n\nA second refresh of the KYRO was planned for 2002, the STG4800 KYRO II SE. Samples of this card were sent to reviewers but it does not appear to have been brought to market. Apart from a clockspeed boost, this refresh was announced with a \"EnT&L\" HW T&L software emulation, which eventually made it into the drivers for the previous KYRO cards starting with version 2.0. The STG5500 KYRO III, based upon the next-generation '''PowerVR4''', was completed and would have included hardware T&L but was shelved due to STMicro closing its graphics division.\n\n* All models support [[DirectX]] 6.0\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Model\n!rowspan=2|Launch\n!rowspan=2|Fab ([[nanometer|nm]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory ([[Mebibyte|MiB]])\n!rowspan=2|Core clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Memory clock ([[Hertz|MHz]])\n!rowspan=2|Core config<sup>1</sup>\n!colspan=4|[[Fillrate]]\n!colspan=3|Memory\n|-\n!MOperations/s\n!MPixels/s\n!MTexels/s\n!MPolygons/s\n!Bandwidth ([[Gigabyte|GB]]/s)\n!Bus type\n!Bus width ([[bit]])\n|-\n!STG4000 KYRO\n|2001\n|250\n|32/64\n|115\n|115\n|2:2\n|230\n|230\n|230\n|0\n|1.84\n|SDR\n|128\n|-\n!STG4500 KYRO II\n|2001\n|180\n|32/64\n|175\n|175\n|2:2\n|350\n|350\n|350\n|0\n|2.8\n|SDR\n|128\n|-\n!STG4800 KYRO II SE\n|2002\n|180\n|64\n|200\n|200\n|2:2\n|400\n|400\n|400\n|0\n|3.2\n|SDR\n|128\n|-\n!STG5500 KYRO III\n|Never Released\n|130\n|64\n|250\n|250\n|4:4\n|1000\n|1000\n|1000\n|0\n|8\n|DDR\n|128\n|-\n|}\n\n* <sup>1</sup> [[Texture mapping unit]]s: [[render output unit]]s\n\n===Series4 (STMicro)===\nPowerVR achieved great success in the mobile graphics market with its low power '''PowerVR MBX'''.

Marriage processions, in medieval times, used to be the most vulnerable targets of robbers as they used to return loaded with gold and other riches received as gifts. While deep into the jungle, the marriage party found itself surrounded by robbers. After killing all the men and looting the wealth the robbers turned to the 'doli' or carriage of the bride.  When they unveiled the carriage they found there was no one inside. The bride had magically disappeared.\nThe word went around, history became legend and legend became myth.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} A temple came up at the site where this incident occurred and locals started worshiping the bride as \"Alopi Devi\" or the 'virgin goddess who had disappeared'.\n\nAlopi Devi continues to be worshiped by thousands of people living in the region who share every festival, marriage, birth and death with their guarding deity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.\n\nThough it was always a prominent temple in the neighborhood, its reach and following has seen a significant rise since the 1990s leading to large-scale renovation of the surrounding area.\n\n==Modern history==\nAs per some historical evidences, Great Maratha Warrior '''Shreenath Mahadji Shinde''' had developed the Sangam place during his stay at Allahabad in 1772 AD.\nMaharani Bayzabai Scindia has done some works for renovation of Sangam ghats and temples at Allahabad.\n \n{{coord missing|Uttar Pradesh}}\n{{Hindu temples in Uttar Pradesh}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Uttar Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Allahabad district]]\n\n\n{{india-hindu-temple-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2019}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2017}}\n'''Alopi Devi Mandir''' is a temple situated in Alopibagh in [[Allahabad]] in state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].

While deep into the jungle, the marriage party found itself surrounded by robbers. After killing all the men and looting the wealth the robbers turned to the 'doli' or carriage of the bride.  When they unveiled the carriage they found there was no one inside. The bride had magically disappeared.\nThe word went around, history became legend and legend became myth.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} A temple came up at the site where this incident occurred and locals started worshiping the bride as \"Alopi Devi\" or the 'virgin goddess who had disappeared'. \n\nAlopi Devi continues to be worshiped by thousands of people living in the region who share every festival, marriage, birth and death with their guarding deity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. \n\nThough it was always a prominent temple in the neighborhood, its reach and following has seen a significant rise since the 1990s leading to large-scale renovation of the surrounding area.\n\n==Modern history==\nAs per some historical evidences, Great Maratha Warrior '''Shreenath Mahadji Shinde''' had developed the Sangam place during his stay at Allahabad in 1772 AD.\nMaharani Bayzabai Scindia has done some works for renovation of Sangam ghats and temples at Allahabad.\n \n{{coord missing|Uttar Pradesh}}\n{{Hindu temples in Uttar Pradesh}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Uttar Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Allahabad district]]\n\n\n{{india-hindu-temple-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Titodutta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopi_Devi_Mandir"}

Note the preparatory crouched posture which [[Power training#Isometric presses and explosive power movements|preloads]] the legs and core; this helps to increase the power of the throw.]]\n'''Ballistic training''', also called '''power training''', is a form of training which involves throwing weights, and jumping with weights, in order to increase explosive power. The intention in ballistic exercises is to maximise the acceleration phase of an object's movement and minimise the deceleration phase. For instance, throwing a [[medicine ball]] maximises the acceleration of the ball; this can be contrasted with a standard weight training exercise where there would be a pronounced deceleration phase at the end of the repetition i.e. at the end of a bench press exercise the barbell is decelerated and brought to a halt. Similarly, an athlete jumping whilst holding a [[trap bar]] maximises the acceleration of the weight through the process of holding it whilst they jump; where as they would decelerate it at the end of a standard trap bar [[deadlift]].<ref>Fleck, Steven J. & Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280</ref> \n\n==History==\n{{see|Throwing}}\n[[File:Schilling (Swiss) mercenary throwing the stone.jpg|thumb|150px|Depiction of a [[stone put]] training method from the Swiss ''[[Lucerne Chronicle]]'',  1513. Note the [[Power training#Isometric presses and explosive power movements|preloading]] of the back leg.]]\nThe word ballistic comes from the Greek word \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''ballein''), which means \u201cto throw\u201d. Evidence of ballistic training can be seen throughout recorded history, especially in depictions which show the throwing of a large stone ([[stone put]]). Other ballistic disciplines from antiquity include the [[javelin throw]] and the [[discus throw]]. The [[hammer throw]] is a younger discipline, known from the 15th century.\n\nSuch throws have been both a popular sporting pastime, and a training method employed by soldiers. Ballistic training was first used in the modern day by [[Sport of athletics|elite athletes]] when they were looking to enhance their ability to perform explosively.   Commonly used modern ballistic training exercises are medicine ball throws, bench throws, jump squats, cleans, snatches, and [[push press|push presses]].\n\n==Focus and effects==\n{{See also|Power training}}\nBallistic training forces the athlete's body to recruit and trigger [[fast twitch muscle|fast twitch]] [[muscle fiber]]s.  This is important because these muscle fibers have the greatest potential for growth and strength.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmaunderground.info/Pages/XFWorkout.aspx|title=XTREME CAGE FIGHTER WORKOUTS|website=MMA UNDERGROUND INC|publisher=MMA UNDERGROUND INC|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>  Ballistic training requires the muscles to adapt to contracting very quickly and forcefully.  This training requires the [[central nervous system]] to coordinate and produce the greatest amount of force in the shortest time possible.\n\nIn traditional weight training the athlete accelerates the weight on the concentric portion over the first third of the lift. During the other two-thirds of the lift, the weight is being slowed\u2014decelerated\u2014and then stopped. With ballistic training, the weight is accelerated through the whole range of motion and only starts to decelerate after the athlete has released the bar. The National Strength and Conditioning Association's ''Basic Guidelines for the Resistance Training of Athletes'' states that \"performing speed repetitions as fast as possible with light weight (e.g., 30\u201345% of [[1-RM]]) in exercises in which the bar is held on to and must be decelerated at the end of the joint\u2019s range of motion (e.g., bench press) to protect the joint does not produce power or speed training but teaches the body how to decelerate, or slow down. If the load can be released into the air (i.e., the bar be let go at the end of the range of motion) the negative effects are eliminated.\"\n\nAdditional research has shown that as much as 75% of a movement can be devoted to slowing the bar down. Elliot, ''et al.'' (1989) reported that during 1-RM bench presses, the bar decelerates for the final 24% of the range of motion. At 81% of 1-RM, the bar decelerates for the final 52% of the range of motion. Research has shown that for best results it is important to load the bar with the amount of weight that allows for positive acceleration to be maintained through the full range of motion for the lift. An effective ballistic lift develops speed throughout the entire range of motion of the lift until the moment of release.\n\n==Criteria==\n1. '''Muscle recruitment principles'''. Ballistic lifts force the muscles to produce the greatest amount of force in the shortest amount of time. In accordance with [[Henneman's size principle]] muscle fibers are recruited from a low to a high threshold as force requirements increase.\n\n2. '''Speed of the movement'''.  To ensure full muscle fiber recruitment the speed of the lift must be propulsive through the entire range of the movement up until release.\n\n3. '''Intensity of the exercise'''. The duration of the lift should be measured by repetitions or time. The lift should be stopped when the bar decelerates. Research has shown the 6-8 repetitions or 20\u201330 seconds produces the best results.\n\n4. '''Cardiovascular benefits'''. Ballistic exercises performed continuously for a minimum of 20 seconds followed by a 30-second rest period and then repeated until deceleration occurs has been proven to elevate the heart rate to training zone level.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010|reason=need to cite the research study that \"proved\" this.}} \n\n5. '''Co-ordination'''. Research at the University of Connecticut found that high-intensity training has profound effects on the nervous system. The exercise had to be of an intensity that elevate the heart rate to 90% of maximum rate and had to sustain that rate for at least 20 seconds.\n\n6. '''Electronic measurement'''. There are several electronic measurement systems that measure the velocity, power, and effectiveness of a lift. The athlete should stop the lift when the speed of a lift has fallen to 90% of their previous lift. The 90% number signals that there has been a significant change in the recruitment of the fast-twitch muscle fibers. Below the 90% number the lift is no longer ballistic\n\n7. '''Specificity of training'''. Ballistic training emphasizes throwing and jumping with a weighted object. Research has resulted in positive increases in vertical jump, throwing velocity, and running speed. There is limited transfer to a specific sport.\n\n==Use in metabolic conditioning==\nBallistic exercises have traditionally been left out of metabolic conditioning workouts and training programs. This may be due to the fact that they are often ''technical lifts,'' or lifts/exercises for which technique is crucial to safe and effective completion. However, with the extensive availability of information and guidance in learning and developing proficiency in ballistic exercise, this trend is changing.\n\nMany training programs which employ circuit training or metabolic conditioning now include ballistic exercises such as [[Kettlebell lifting|kettlebell cleans and snatches]], Olympic lifts and variations, throws and [[Plyometrics|plyometric]] variations. The benefits of their inclusion in these types of programs include higher levels of motor unit recruitment, higher caloric burn and improvements in a number of measurable athletic outputs.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Calisthenics]]\n*[[Complex training]]\n*[[Plyometrics]]\n*[[Power training]]\n*[[Strength training]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{No footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n*Baechle T.R. and Earle R.W.

The manufacture of first-stage booster constitutes about 60% of the launch price of a single Falcon 9 (and three of them over 80% of the launch price of a Falcon Heavy), which led SpaceX to develop a program dedicated to recovery and reuse of these boosters for a significant decrease in launch costs.<!-- add refs pls --> After multiple attempts, some as early as 2010, at controlling the reentry of the first stage after its separation from the second stage, the first successful controlled landing of a first stage occurred on 22 December 2015, on the first flight of the [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|Full Thrust]] version.  Since then, Falcon 9 first-stage boosters have been landed and recovered {{Falcon rocket statistics|Landingsuccess}} times out of {{Falcon rocket statistics|Landingattempt}} attempts, including synchronized recoveries of the side-boosters of the [[Falcon Heavy test flight]], [[Arabsat-6A]], and [[Space Test Program|STP-2]] missions. One out of three Falcon Heavy center boosters landed softly but it was severely damaged during transport.<!-- UPDATE (or generalize?) after Falcon Heavy flights-->\n\nIn total {{Falcon rocket statistics|Multipleflights}} recovered boosters have been refurbished and subsequently flown a second time including several boosters with three or four missions and one with five missions.<!-- UPDATE after a fifth flight--> SpaceX intentionally limited Block 3 and Block 4 boosters to flying only two missions each,<ref name=nsf20180719>{{cite news|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/07/spacex-five-recoveries-less-two-weeks-fleet-activity/|title=SpaceX to attempt five recoveries in less than two weeks as fleet activity ramps up|work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]|first=Michael|last=Baylor|date=19 July 2018|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=block4retirement/> but the company expects the Block 5 versions to achieve 10 flights each without major refurbishment.<ref name=\"nsf20180517\"/>\n\n== List of boosters ==\n=== Block 5 ===\nBlock 5 is the final iteration of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters. Changes include a stronger [[heat shield]], uprated engines, new [[carbon composite]] sections (landing legs, engine sections, [[Raceway (wire molding)|raceways]], [[Reaction control system|RCS thrusters]] and interstage), retractable landing legs, titanium grid fins, and other additions that simplify refurbishment and allow for easier reusability.

Changes included a larger fuel tank, uprated engines and superchilled propellant and oxidizer to increase performance. Also included in this list is the upgraded version of the full thrust variant called Falcon 9 block 4. Block 4 was a test version that included new hardware like titanium grid fins later used for the next and final major version of the Falcon 9, aka Block 5. Flights of all Falcon 9 rockets up to Block 4 were limited to 2 flights only, with a total of 14-second flights of these variants. The boosters were either retired or expended after that second launch.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width: 100%;\"\n! Core\n! Version\n!

Version 1.0 of the falcon 9 was the very first version. The Falcon 9 looked very different from what it does today and it was much smaller and had much less power. On the maiden flight and second flight of V 1.0, SpaceX included basic recovery hardware (parachutes) to try and recover the 1st stages. Unfortunetly, because the 1st stage broke up on re-entry due to aerodynamic forces both times, SpaceX gave up on parachutes and decided to pursue propulsive landings instead. First came some controlled water landings, then came the attempts on the Droneship \"Just Read the Instructions 1\". None of these boosters were recovered or survived landing after an orbital launch. Two test devices made several short flights each.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width: 100%;\"\n! Core\n! Version\n!

The manufacture of first-stage booster constitutes about 60% of the launch price of a single Falcon 9 (and three of them over 80% of the launch price of a Falcon Heavy), which led SpaceX to develop a program dedicated to recovery and reuse of these boosters for a significant decrease in launch costs.<!-- add refs pls --> After multiple attempts, some as early as 2010, at controlling the reentry of the first stage after its separation from the second stage, the first successful controlled landing of a first stage occurred on 22 December 2015, on the first flight of the [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|Full Thrust]] version.  Since then, Falcon 9 first-stage boosters have been landed and recovered {{Falcon rocket statistics|Landingsuccess}} times out of {{Falcon rocket statistics|Landingattempt}} attempts, including synchronized recoveries of the side-boosters of the [[Falcon Heavy test flight]], [[Arabsat-6A]], and [[Space Test Program|STP-2]] missions.

Changes included a larger fuel tank, uprated engines and superchilled propellant and oxidizer to increase performance. Also included in this list is the upgraded version of the full thrust variant called Falcon 9 block 4. Block 4 was a test version that included new hardware like titanium grid fins later used for the next and final major version of the Falcon 9, aka Block 5. Flights of all Falcon 9 rockets up to Block 4 were limited to 2 flights only, with a total of 14-second flights of these variants. The boosters were either retired or expended after that second launch.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width: 100%;\"\n! Core\n! Version\n!

Version 1.0 of the falcon 9 was the very first version. The Falcon 9 looked very different from what it does today and it was much smaller and had much less power. On the maiden flight and second flight of V 1.0, SpaceX included basic recovery hardware (parachutes) to try and recover the 1st stages. Unfortunetly, because the 1st stage broke up on re-entry due to aerodynamic forces both times, SpaceX gave up on parachutes and decided to pursue propulsive landings instead. First came some controlled water landings, then came the attempts on the Droneship \"Just Read the Instructions 1\". None of these boosters were recovered or survived landing after an orbital launch. Two test devices made several short flights each.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width: 100%;\"\n! Core\n! Version\n!

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] both executive and judicial officials for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\". Impeachment is a ''formal accusation'' of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the [[defendant]] be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only three presidents have ever been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2020.  All three [[trial (law)|trials]] ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In 1974, [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the [[House Judiciary Committee]] indicated he would eventually be removed from office.\n\nThe Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials, judges, and other high officers \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate\". It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, [[Hillary Clinton]], urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010.<ref name=tws2010Sep11rr>{{cite news |author= Charles Wolfson |title= Clinton Presses Senate to Ratify Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia\n|publisher= CBS News |date= August 11, 2010 |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20013329-503544.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> The House of Representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials, other than in [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy|filling a vacancy]] in the office of the vice president; in such a case, a majority vote in each House is required to confirm a president's nomination of a vice president.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nIn 1803, the Supreme Court established [[judicial review]] of federal legislation in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws [[unconstitutional]] was envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in [[Federalist No. 78]]. [[Originalism|Originalists]] on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legal_issues/legal_updates/us_supreme_court/scalia-constitutional-speech.htm |title=Constitutional Interpretation the Old Fashioned Way |publisher=Center For Individual Freedom |accessdate=September 15, 2007}}</ref> Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its [[Dred Scott]] decision.<ref name=tws2010Sep11ss>{{cite news |title= Decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott Case |newspaper= The New York Times |date= March 6, 1851 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0306.html\n|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.\n\nThe congressional inquiry into [[St. Clair's Defeat]] of 1791 was the first congressional investigation of the executive branch.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/remembering-st-clairs-defeat |title=Remembering St. Clair's Defeat |first=Matthew |last=Waxman |publisher=[[Lawfare (blog)|Lawfare]] |date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> Investigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation, to test the effectiveness of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches.

Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the [[Government Accountability Office]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\n\n===Committees===\n[[File:The United States Legislative Process - Committee Consideration (3) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|Library of Congress video explanation of committees in the United States Congress]] \n[[File:Congress Hall committee room 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a table with chairs.|Second committee room in [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n{{Main|United States congressional committee}}\n\n====Specializations====\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely.

While procedures, such as the House [[discharge petition]] process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, yet they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called ''independent fiefdoms''. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and [[United States congressional subcommittee|subcommittees]] which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> In addition, they perform the function of ''oversight'' by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.<ref name=\"House_Rules\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162313/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/98-241.pdf Committee Types and Roles], [[Congressional Research Service]], April 1, 2003</ref>\n\n====Officer====\nAt the start of each two-year session the House elects a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]] who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the vice president is the [[ex officio]] ''president'' of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]]. ''Pro tempore'' means ''for the time being'' and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\n\n===Support services===\n====Library of Congress====\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson Building Aerial by Carol M.

Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the [[War of 1812]], but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private library. One of the library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public.

The period after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was marked by partisanship, as is the case today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some [[Political science|political scientists]] speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades, but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14cc577>{{cite book |author1=Steven S.

A new session commences on January 3 each year, unless Congress decides differently. The Constitution requires Congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n===Joint sessions===\n{{Main|Joint session of the United States Congress}}\nJoint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both House and Senate. These sessions include counting [[electoral votes]] after a presidential election and the president's [[State of the Union]] address. The [[State of the Union|constitutionally mandated report]], normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's [[Speech from the Throne]], was written by most presidents after [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] in 1913. Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.\n\n===Bills and resolutions===\n{{See also|Act of Congress|List of United States federal legislation}}\n[[File:Private Law 86-407.jpg|An [[Act of Congress]] from 1960.|thumb]]\n[[File:US House Committee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House Financial Services committee]] meets. Committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs, while those testifying and audience members sit below.]]\n\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills. Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\n\n* '''Bills''' are laws in the making. A House-originated bill begins with the letters \"H.R.\" for \"House of Representatives\", followed by a number kept as it progresses.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Joint resolutions'''. There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly; a joint resolution originating from the House, for example, begins \"H.J.Res.\" followed by its number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Concurrent Resolutions''' affect only both the House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later. In the House, they begin with \"H.Con.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Simple resolutions''' concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with \"H.Res.\" or \"S.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n\nRepresentatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the ''hopper'' on the Clerk's desk.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> It is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Drafting statutes requires \"great skill, knowledge, and experience\" and sometimes take a year or more.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]]. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" While the Senate cannot originate [[revenue]] and [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bills]], it has power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nEach chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a [[U.S. House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]] guides legislation; in the Senate, a [[Standing Rules of the Senate|Standing Rules]] committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting \"unanimous consent\" for noncontroversial matters.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/> Members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper Congressional procedures.<ref name=tws2010Sep11nn>{{cite news |author= Partnership for Public Service |title= Walter Oleszek: A Hill Staffer's Guide to Congressional History and Habit |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= March 29, 2009 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701563.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the [[Government Accountability Office]].<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Most legislation is considered by [[standing committee]]s which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A committee might call for public hearings on important bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Each committee is led by a [[chairperson|chair]] who belongs to the majority party and a [[ranking minority member|ranking member]] of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Then, a bill may go to what is called a ''mark-up'' session, where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is ''tabled'' then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called ''clean bill'' with a new number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.<ref name=tws2010Sep11qq/>\n\nA bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> and begins with an [[enacting formula]] such as \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.\" Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a ''rule'' which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate\u2014time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Sometimes opponents seek to ''recommit'' a bill which means to change part of it.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Generally, discussion requires a ''quorum'', usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11mm>{{cite news |title= News from Washington |newspaper= The New York Times |date= December 3, 1861 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FA38541A7493C1A91789D95F458684F9 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010131909/http://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/03/news/washington-meeting-thirty-seventh-congress-quorum-present-both-houses-business.html |url-status = dead|archive-date= October 10, 2017 |accessdate= September 11, 2010 }}</ref> The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ. A final vote on the bill follows.\n\nOnce a bill is approved by one house, it is sent to the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], an ''ad hoc'' committee that includes both senators and representatives<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> sometimes by using a ''reconciliation process'' to limit budget bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as ''pay-as-you-go'' or ''paygo'' which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.\n\nThe Constitution specifies that a majority of members, known as a ''[[quorum]],'' be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a [[quorum call]] demonstrates the contrary and debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.\n\nVoting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout \"aye\" or \"no\" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|recorded vote]] if demanded by one-fifth of the members present or when voting to override a presidential veto. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll-call voting]], in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating \"aye\" or \"no\" when their name is announced. In the Senate, the Vice President may cast the tie-breaking vote if present when the Senators are equally divided.\n\nThe House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' or ''present'' or ''open''.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Members insert a voting ''ID card'' and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions\u2014''yea'' indicated by green and ''nay'' by red.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> One member cannot cast a [[proxy vote]] for another.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.<ref name=tws2010Sep11gg>{{cite news |author= United States government |title= Recent Votes |publisher= United States Senate |year= 2010 |url= https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=tws2010Sep11t7>{{cite news|title=The U.S. Congress \u2013 Votes Database \u2013 Members of Congress / Robert Byrd |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110035120/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |archivedate=November 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAfter passage by both houses, a bill is [[Enrolled bill|enrolled]] and sent to the president for approval.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with the president's objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing\u2014neither signing nor vetoing the bill\u2014and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution. But if Congress is adjourned during this period, presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it; the maneuver is known as a [[pocket veto]], and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.\n\n==Congress and the public==\n{{Main|U.S. Congress and citizens}}\n\n===Advantage of incumbency===\n====Citizens and representatives====\nSenators face reelection every six years, and representatives every two.

The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the Constitution that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place\". Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for [[slander]] because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress.\n\nObstructing the work of Congress is a crime under [[federal law]] and is known as [[contempt of Congress]]. Each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation\u2014the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe [[franking]] privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense.

The Congress meets in the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Both senators and representatives are chosen through [[direct election]], though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a [[Governor (United States)|gubernatorial]] appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 435 representatives and 100 senators. In addition, the House of Representatives currently has six [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting members]], bringing the total membership of the US Congress to 541<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45583|title=Membership of the 116th Congress: A Profile|page=4|website=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=5 March 2020|quote=Congress is composed of 541 individuals from the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico.}}</ref> or fewer in the case of vacancies.\n\nThe members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a single constituency, known as a ''district''. [[Congressional districts of the United States|Congressional districts]] are [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] to [[U.S. state|states]] by [[Representation by population|population]] using the [[United States Census]] results, provided that each state has at least ''one congressional representative. Each state'', regardless of population or size, has two senators. Currently, there are 100 senators representing the 50 states. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with [[Staggered elections|terms staggered]], so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election.\n\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution]] requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old (House) or 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the United States for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the [[U.S. state|state]] which they represent. A small number of senators in the 19th century were [[List of youngest members of the United States Congress|under 30 years old]] and therefore did not meet the constitutional age requirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref>\n\nThe Congress was created by the [[Constitution of the United States]] and first met in 1789, replacing in its legislative function the [[Congress of the Confederation]]. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with the [[Republican party (United States)|Republican Party]] or with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and only rarely with a [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|third party]] or [[Independent (politician)|independents]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The United States Legislative Process Overview (1) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|left|Overview of the United States legislative process, as explained by the [[Library of Congress]]]]\n[[File:Johnson Impeachment Committee.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Seven men wearing suits posing for a group picture.|In 1868, this committee of representatives prosecuted President [[Andrew Johnson]] in his impeachment trial, but the Senate did not convict him.]]\n[[Article One of the United States Constitution]] states, \"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\" The House and Senate are equal partners in the legislative process\u2014legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers. However, the Constitution grants each chamber some unique powers.

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe Constitution concentrates removal powers in the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeach]] both executive and judicial officials for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\". Impeachment is a ''formal accusation'' of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the [[defendant]] be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only three presidents have ever been impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2020.  All three [[trial (law)|trials]] ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In 1974, [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the [[House Judiciary Committee]] indicated he would eventually be removed from office.\n\nThe Senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] officials, judges, and other high officers \"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate\". It confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon. Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to take effect. As a result, presidential arm-twisting of senators can happen before a key vote; for example, President Obama's secretary of state, [[Hillary Clinton]], urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with Russia in 2010.<ref name=tws2010Sep11rr>{{cite news |author= Charles Wolfson |title= Clinton Presses Senate to Ratify Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia\n|publisher= CBS News |date= August 11, 2010 |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20013329-503544.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> The House of Representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials, other than in [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 2: Vice Presidential vacancy|filling a vacancy]] in the office of the vice president; in such a case, a majority vote in each House is required to confirm a president's nomination of a vice president.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nIn 1803, the Supreme Court established [[judicial review]] of federal legislation in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws [[unconstitutional]] was envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in [[Federalist No. 78]]. [[Originalism|Originalists]] on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legal_issues/legal_updates/us_supreme_court/scalia-constitutional-speech.htm |title=Constitutional Interpretation the Old Fashioned Way |publisher=Center For Individual Freedom |accessdate=September 15, 2007}}</ref> Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its [[Dred Scott]] decision.<ref name=tws2010Sep11ss>{{cite news |title= Decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott Case |newspaper= The New York Times |date= March 6, 1851 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0306.html\n|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref> At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.\n\nThe congressional inquiry into [[St. Clair's Defeat]] of 1791 was the first congressional investigation of the executive branch.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/remembering-st-clairs-defeat |title=Remembering St. Clair's Defeat |first=Matthew |last=Waxman |publisher=[[Lawfare (blog)|Lawfare]] |date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> Investigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation, to test the effectiveness of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches.

Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the [[Government Accountability Office]] and the [[Library of Congress]] to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\n\n===Committees===\n[[File:The United States Legislative Process - Committee Consideration (3) - Library of Congress.webm|thumb|Library of Congress video explanation of committees in the United States Congress]] \n[[File:Congress Hall committee room 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a table with chairs.|Second committee room in [[Congress Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n{{Main|United States congressional committee}}\n\n====Specializations====\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely.

While procedures, such as the House [[discharge petition]] process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, yet they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called ''independent fiefdoms''. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and [[United States congressional subcommittee|subcommittees]] which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.<ref name=\"House_Rules\"/> In addition, they perform the function of ''oversight'' by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.<ref name=\"House_Rules\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162313/http://www.rules.house.gov/archives/98-241.pdf Committee Types and Roles], [[Congressional Research Service]], April 1, 2003</ref>\n\n====Officer====\nAt the start of each two-year session the House elects a [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]] who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the vice president is the [[ex officio]] ''president'' of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]]. ''Pro tempore'' means ''for the time being'' and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\n\n===Support services===\n====Library of Congress====\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson Building Aerial by Carol M.

Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices. The Library had mostly law books when it was burned by a British raiding party during the [[War of 1812]], but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private library. One of the library's missions is to serve the Congress and its staff as well as the American public.

Committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs, while those testifying and audience members sit below.]]\n\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies. Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills. Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well. The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\n\n* '''Bills''' are laws in the making. A House-originated bill begins with the letters \"H.R.\" for \"House of Representatives\", followed by a number kept as it progresses.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Joint resolutions'''. There is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly; a joint resolution originating from the House, for example, begins \"H.J.Res.\" followed by its number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Concurrent Resolutions''' affect only both the House and Senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later. In the House, they begin with \"H.Con.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n* '''Simple resolutions''' concern only the House or only the Senate and begin with \"H.Res.\" or \"S.Res.\"<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/>\n\nRepresentatives introduce a bill while the House is in session by placing it in the ''hopper'' on the Clerk's desk.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> It is assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Drafting statutes requires \"great skill, knowledge, and experience\" and sometimes take a year or more.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction. Joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have the force of law but express the opinion of Congress or regulate [[Parliamentary procedure|procedure]]. Bills may be introduced by any member of either house. However, the Constitution states, \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" While the Senate cannot originate [[revenue]] and [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriation bills]], it has power to amend or reject them. Congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/>\n\nEach chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a [[U.S. House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]] guides legislation; in the Senate, a [[Standing Rules of the Senate|Standing Rules]] committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting \"unanimous consent\" for noncontroversial matters.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law.<ref name=tws2010Sep11t14aa/> Members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper Congressional procedures.<ref name=tws2010Sep11nn>{{cite news |author= Partnership for Public Service |title= Walter Oleszek: A Hill Staffer's Guide to Congressional History and Habit |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= March 29, 2009 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032701563.html |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the [[Government Accountability Office]].<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Most legislation is considered by [[standing committee]]s which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> A committee might call for public hearings on important bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Each committee is led by a [[chairperson|chair]] who belongs to the majority party and a [[ranking minority member|ranking member]] of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Then, a bill may go to what is called a ''mark-up'' session, where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is ''tabled'' then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called ''clean bill'' with a new number.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.<ref name=tws2010Sep11qq/>\n\nA bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> and begins with an [[enacting formula]] such as \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.\" Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a ''rule'' which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate\u2014time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Sometimes opponents seek to ''recommit'' a bill which means to change part of it.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> Generally, discussion requires a ''quorum'', usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.<ref name=tws2010Sep11mm>{{cite news |title= News from Washington |newspaper= The New York Times |date= December 3, 1861 |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FA38541A7493C1A91789D95F458684F9 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010131909/http://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/03/news/washington-meeting-thirty-seventh-congress-quorum-present-both-houses-business.html |url-status = dead|archive-date= October 10, 2017 |accessdate= September 11, 2010 }}</ref> The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ. A final vote on the bill follows.\n\nOnce a bill is approved by one house, it is sent to the other which may pass, reject, or amend it. For the bill to become law, both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> If the second house amends the bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]], an ''ad hoc'' committee that includes both senators and representatives<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> sometimes by using a ''reconciliation process'' to limit budget bills.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as ''pay-as-you-go'' or ''paygo'' which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> If both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee, the bill passes, otherwise it fails.\n\nThe Constitution specifies that a majority of members, known as a ''[[quorum]],'' be present before doing business in each house. However, the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a [[quorum call]] demonstrates the contrary and debate often continues despite the lack of a majority.\n\nVoting within Congress can take many forms, including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout \"aye\" or \"no\" and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, requires a [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|recorded vote]] if demanded by one-fifth of the members present or when voting to override a presidential veto. If the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial, a recorded vote usually happens. The Senate uses [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll-call voting]], in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator stating \"aye\" or \"no\" when their name is announced. In the Senate, the Vice President may cast the tie-breaking vote if present when the Senators are equally divided.\n\nThe House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote ''yea'' or ''nay'' or ''present'' or ''open''.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Members insert a voting ''ID card'' and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasions\u2014''yea'' indicated by green and ''nay'' by red.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> One member cannot cast a [[proxy vote]] for another.<ref name=tws2010Sep11bb/> Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.<ref name=tws2010Sep11gg>{{cite news |author= United States government |title= Recent Votes |publisher= United States Senate |year= 2010 |url= https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/a_three_sections_with_teasers/votes.htm |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=tws2010Sep11t7>{{cite news|title=The U.S. Congress \u2013 Votes Database \u2013 Members of Congress / Robert Byrd |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110035120/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/k000105/ |archivedate=November 10, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAfter passage by both houses, a bill is [[Enrolled bill|enrolled]] and sent to the president for approval.<ref name=tws2010Sep11cc/> The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with the president's objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing\u2014neither signing nor vetoing the bill\u2014and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution. But if Congress is adjourned during this period, presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it; the maneuver is known as a [[pocket veto]], and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.\n\n==Congress and the public==\n{{Main|U.S. Congress and citizens}}\n\n===Advantage of incumbency===\n====Citizens and representatives====\nSenators face reelection every six years, and representatives every two.

The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, providing in the [[Speech or Debate Clause]] of the Constitution that \"for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place\". Accordingly, a member of Congress may not be sued in court for [[slander]] because of remarks made in either house, although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress.\n\nObstructing the work of Congress is a crime under [[federal law]] and is known as [[contempt of Congress]]. Each member has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation\u2014the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress may be imprisoned for up to one year.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe [[franking]] privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense.
