The right vagus then crosses anterior to the right subclavian artery, runs posterior to the [[superior vena cava]], descends posterior to the [[right main bronchus]], and contributes to [[cardiac plexus|cardiac]], [[pulmonary plexus|pulmonary]], and [[esophageal plexus]]es.

It gives rise to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which hooks around the aortic arch to the left of the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] and ascends between the trachea and esophagus.

Vagal and spinal ganglionic nerves mediate the lowering of the [[heart rate]]. The right vagus branch innervates the [[sinoatrial node]]. In healthy people, parasympathetic tone from these sources are well-matched to sympathetic tone. Hyperstimulation of parasympathetic influence promotes [[bradyarrhythmias]]. When hyperstimulated, the left vagal branch predisposes the heart to [[heart block|conduction block]] at the [[atrioventricular node]].\n\nAt this location, neuroscientist [[Otto Loewi]] first demonstrated that nerves secrete substances called [[neurotransmitters]], which have effects on receptors in target tissues. In his experiment, Loewi electrically stimulated the vagus nerve of a frog heart, which slowed the heart. Then he took the fluid from the heart and transferred it to a second frog heart without a vagus nerve. The second heart slowed down without an electrical stimulation. Loewi described the substance released by the vagus nerve as [[vagusstoff]], which was later found to be [[acetylcholine]]. Drugs that inhibit the [[muscarinic receptor]]s ([[anticholinergic]]s) such as [[atropine]] and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], are called vagolytic because they inhibit the action of the vagus nerve on the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.  Anticholinergic drugs increase heart rate and are used to treat [[bradycardia]].\n\n=== Physical and emotional effects ===\nExcessive activation of the vagal nerve during [[emotional stress]], which is a parasympathetic overcompensation for a strong [[sympathetic nervous system]] response associated with stress, can also cause [[Reflex syncope|vasovagal syncope]] due to a sudden drop in [[cardiac output]], causing [[Brain ischemia|cerebral hypoperfusion]]. Vasovagal syncope affects young children and women more than other groups. It can also lead to temporary [[urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]] under moments of extreme fear.\n\nResearch has shown that women having had complete [[spinal cord injury]] can experience [[orgasm]]s through the vagus nerve, which can go from the [[uterus]] and [[cervix]] to the brain.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | work=Wired | title=Exploring the Mind-Body Orgasm | date=2007-01-10 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919100602/http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | archive-date=19 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Komisaruk BR, Whipple B, Crawford A, Liu WC, Kalnin A, Mosier K | title = Brain activation during vaginocervical self-stimulation and orgasm in women with complete spinal cord injury: fMRI evidence of mediation by the vagus nerves | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1024 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 77\u201388 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15451368 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.07.029 }}</ref>\n\n[[Insulin]] signaling activates the [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the [[arcuate nucleus]], decreases AgRP release, and through the vagus nerve, leads to decreased glucose production by the liver by decreasing gluconeogenic enzymes: [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], [[Glucose 6-phosphatase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pocai A, Lam TK, Gutierrez-Juarez R, Obici S, Schwartz GJ, Bryan J, Aguilar-Bryan L, Rossetti L | title = Hypothalamic K(ATP) channels control hepatic glucose production | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036 | pages = 1026\u201331 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15846348 | doi = 10.1038/nature03439 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagotto U | title = Where does insulin resistance start?

The right vagus then crosses anterior to the right subclavian artery, runs posterior to the [[superior vena cava]], descends posterior to the [[right main bronchus]], and contributes to [[cardiac plexus|cardiac]], [[pulmonary plexus|pulmonary]], and [[esophageal plexus]]es.  It forms the [[posterior vagal trunk]] at the lower part of the esophagus and enters the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] through the [[esophageal hiatus]].\n\nThe left vagus nerve enters the thorax between [[left common carotid artery]] and left subclavian artery and descends on the [[aortic arch]].  It gives rise to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which hooks around the aortic arch to the left of the [[ligamentum arteriosum]] and ascends between the trachea and esophagus.

Vagal and spinal ganglionic nerves mediate the lowering of the [[heart rate]]. The right vagus branch innervates the [[sinoatrial node]]. In healthy people, parasympathetic tone from these sources are well-matched to sympathetic tone. Hyperstimulation of parasympathetic influence promotes [[bradyarrhythmias]]. When hyperstimulated, the left vagal branch predisposes the heart to [[heart block|conduction block]] at the [[atrioventricular node]].\n\nAt this location, neuroscientist [[Otto Loewi]] first demonstrated that nerves secrete substances called [[neurotransmitters]], which have effects on receptors in target tissues. In his experiment, Loewi electrically stimulated the vagus nerve of a frog heart, which slowed the heart. Then he took the fluid from the heart and transferred it to a second frog heart without a vagus nerve. The second heart slowed down without an electrical stimulation. Loewi described the substance released by the vagus nerve as [[vagusstoff]], which was later found to be [[acetylcholine]]. Drugs that inhibit the [[muscarinic receptor]]s ([[anticholinergic]]s) such as [[atropine]] and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], are called vagolytic because they inhibit the action of the vagus nerve on the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.  Anticholinergic drugs increase heart rate and are used to treat [[bradycardia]].\n\n=== Physical and emotional effects ===\nExcessive activation of the vagal nerve during [[emotional stress]], which is a parasympathetic overcompensation for a strong [[sympathetic nervous system]] response associated with stress, can also cause [[Reflex syncope|vasovagal syncope]] due to a sudden drop in [[cardiac output]], causing [[Brain ischemia|cerebral hypoperfusion]]. Vasovagal syncope affects young children and women more than other groups. It can also lead to temporary [[urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]] under moments of extreme fear.\n\nResearch has shown that women having had complete [[spinal cord injury]] can experience [[orgasm]]s through the vagus nerve, which can go from the [[uterus]] and [[cervix]] to the brain.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | work=Wired | title=Exploring the Mind-Body Orgasm | date=2007-01-10 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919100602/http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/01/72325 | archive-date=19 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Komisaruk BR, Whipple B, Crawford A, Liu WC, Kalnin A, Mosier K | title = Brain activation during vaginocervical self-stimulation and orgasm in women with complete spinal cord injury: fMRI evidence of mediation by the vagus nerves | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1024 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 77\u201388 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15451368 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2004.07.029 }}</ref>\n\n[[Insulin]] signaling activates the [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the [[arcuate nucleus]], decreases AgRP release, and through the vagus nerve, leads to decreased glucose production by the liver by decreasing gluconeogenic enzymes: [[Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], [[Glucose 6-phosphatase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pocai A, Lam TK, Gutierrez-Juarez R, Obici S, Schwartz GJ, Bryan J, Aguilar-Bryan L, Rossetti L | title = Hypothalamic K(ATP) channels control hepatic glucose production | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036 | pages = 1026\u201331 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15846348 | doi = 10.1038/nature03439 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagotto U | title = Where does insulin resistance start?

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

The scenegraph corresponds to what is on screen and the Wayland compositor understands the transformations that it may have applied to the elements in the scenegraph. Thus, the Wayland compositor can pick the right window and transform the screen coordinates to window local coordinates, by applying the inverse transformations. The types of transformation that can be applied to a window is only restricted to what the compositor can do, as long as it can compute the inverse transformation for the input events.\n| As in the X case, when the client receives the event, it updates the UI in response. But in the Wayland case, the rendering happens by the client via [[EGL (API)|EGL]], and the client just sends a request to the compositor to indicate the region that was updated.\n| The Wayland compositor collects damage requests from its clients and then re-composites the screen. The compositor can then directly issue an [[ioctl]] to schedule a pageflip with [[KMS (Linux kernel)|KMS]].}}]]\n\nStarting around 2010, Linux desktop graphics has moved from having \"a pile of [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] interfaces... all talking to the [[display server|X server]], which is at the center of the universe\" towards putting the Linux kernel and its components (i.e. [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)]], [[Direct Rendering Manager|Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)]]) \"in the middle\", with \"window systems like X and Wayland ... off in the corner\". This will be \"a much-simplified graphics system offering more flexibility and better performance\".{{r|Corbet 2010}}\n\nKristian H\u00f8gsberg could have added an [[Xdmx|extension to X]] as many recent projects have done, but preferred to \"[push] X out of the hotpath between clients and the hardware\" for reasons explained in the project's FAQ:{{r|Wayland FAQ}}\n\n{{quote|What\u2019s different now is that a lot of infrastructure has moved from the [[display server|X server]] into the kernel (memory management, command scheduling, [[mode-setting|mode setting]]) or libraries ([[cairo (graphics)|cairo]], pixman, [[freetype]], [[fontconfig]], [[pango]], etc.), and there is very little left that has to happen in a central server process. ... [An X server has] a tremendous amount of functionality that you must support to claim to speak the X protocol, yet nobody will ever use this. ... This includes code tables, glyph rasterization and caching, [[X logical font description|XLFDs]] (seriously, XLFDs!), and the entire core rendering API that lets you draw stippled lines, polygons, wide arcs and many more state-of-the-1980s style graphics primitives. For many things we've been able to keep the X.org server modern by adding extension such as [[XRandR]], [[XRender]] and [[composite (graphics)|COMPOSITE]] ... With Wayland we can move the X server and all its legacy technology to an optional code path. Getting to a point where the X server is a compatibility option instead of the core rendering system will take a while, but we'll never get there if [we] don\u2019t plan for it.}}\n\nWayland consists of a protocol and a reference implementation named [[#Weston|Weston]]. The project is also developing versions of [[GTK]] and [[Qt (software)|Qt]] that render to Wayland instead of to X. Most applications are expected to gain support for Wayland through one of these libraries without modification to the application.\n\nInitial versions of Wayland have not provided [[network transparency]], though H\u00f8gsberg noted in 2010 that network transparency is possible.{{r|H\u00f8gsberg remotewl}}\nIt was attempted as a [[Google Summer of Code]] project in 2011, but was not successful.{{r|Larabel 2011 remote}}\nAdam Jackson has envisioned providing remote access to a Wayland application by either \"pixel-scraping\" (like [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]]) or getting it to send a \"rendering command stream\" across the network (as in [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]], [[SPICE (protocol)|SPICE]] or [[X Window System|X11]]).{{r|Jackson remotewl}} As of early 2013, H\u00f8gsberg is experimenting with network transparency using a proxy Wayland server which sends compressed images to the real compositor.{{r|Stone 2013 LCA}}{{r|Willis 2013}} In August 2017, GNOME saw the first such pixel-scraping VNC server implementation under Wayland.{{r|GNOME Remote Desktop}}\n\n==Software architecture==\n\n===Protocol architecture===\n[[File:Wayland protocol architecture.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|In the Wayland protocol architecture, a client and a compositor communicate through the Wayland protocol using the reference implementation libraries.]]\n\nWayland protocol follows a [[client\u2013server model]] in which clients are the graphical applications requesting the display of pixel buffers on the screen, and the server (compositor) is the service provider controlling the display of these buffers.\n\nThe Wayland reference implementation has been designed as a two-layer protocol:{{r|hellowl}}\n* A low-level layer or ''wire protocol'' that handles the [[inter-process communication]] between the two involved [[Process (computing)|processes]]{{mdashb}}client and compositor{{mdashb}}and the [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshalling]] of the data that they interchange. This layer is message-based and usually implemented using the kernel IPC services, specifically [[Unix domain sockets]] in the case of [[Linux]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems.{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}}\n* A high-level layer built upon it, that handles the information that client and compositor need to exchange to implement the basic features of a [[window system]]. This layer is implemented as \"an asynchronous object-oriented protocol\".{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}}\n\nWhile the low-level layer was written manually in [[C (programming language)|C]], the high-level layer is automatically generated from a description of the elements of the protocol stored in [[XML]] format.{{r|wlprotoxml}} Every time the protocol description of this XML file changes, the C source code that implements such protocol can be regenerated to include the new changes, allowing a very flexible, extensible and error-proof protocol.\n\nThe reference implementation of Wayland protocol is split in two [[Library (computing)|libraries]]: a library to be used by Wayland clients called <code>libwayland-client</code> and a library to be used by Wayland compositors called <code>libwayland-server</code>.{{r|Wayland doc|page=57}}\n\n===Protocol overview===\nThe Wayland protocol is described as an \"asynchronous [[object-oriented]] protocol\".{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}} ''Object-oriented'' means that the services offered by the compositor are presented as a series of ''objects'' living on the same compositor. Each object implements an ''interface'' which has a name, a number of methods (called ''requests'') as well as several associated ''events''. Every request and event has zero or more arguments, each one with a name and a [[data type]]. The protocol is ''asynchronous'' in the sense that requests do not have to wait for synchronized replies or [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|ACKs]], avoiding [[round-trip delay time]] and achieving improved performance.\n\nThe Wayland clients can make a request (a method invocation) on some object if the object's interface supports that request. The client must also supply the required data for the arguments of such request. This is the way the clients request services from the compositor. The compositor in turn sends information back to the client by causing the object to emit events (probably with arguments too). These events can be emitted by the compositor as a response to a certain request, or asynchronously, subject to the occurrence of internal events (such as one from an input device) or state changes. The error conditions are also signaled as events by the compositor.{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}}\n\nFor a client to be able to make a request to an object, it first needs to tell the server the ID number it will use to identify that object.{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}} There are two types of objects in the compositor: global objects and non-global objects. Global objects are advertised by the compositor to the clients when they are created (and also when they are destroyed), while non-global objects are usually created by other objects that already exist as part of their functionality.{{r|Paalanen 2014}}\n\nThe interfaces and their requests and events are the core elements that define the Wayland protocol. Each version of the protocol includes a set of interfaces, along with their requests and events, which are expected to be in any Wayland compositor. Optionally, a Wayland compositor may define and implement its own interfaces that support new requests and events, thereby extending functionality beyond the core protocol.{{r|Wayland doc|page=10}} To facilitate changes to the protocol, each interface contains a \"version number\" attribute in addition to its name; this attribute allows for distinguishing variants of the same interface. Each Wayland compositor exposes not only what interfaces are available, but also the supported versions of those interfaces.{{r|Wayland doc|page=12}}\n\n====Wayland core interfaces====\nThe interfaces of the current version of Wayland protocol are defined in the file <tt>protocol/wayland.xml</tt> of the Wayland source code.{{r|wlprotoxml}} This is an [[XML]] file that lists the existing interfaces in the current version, along with their requests, events and other attributes. This set of interfaces is the minimum required to be implemented by any Wayland compositor.\n\nSome of the most basic interfaces of the Wayland protocol are:{{r|Wayland doc|pages=10-12}}\n* ''wl_display''{{snd}} the core global object, a special object to encapsulate the Wayland protocol itself\n* ''wl_registry''{{snd}} the global registry object, in which the compositor registers all the global objects that it wants to be available to all clients\n* ''wl_compositor''{{snd}} an object that represents the compositor, and is in charge of combining the different surfaces into one output\n* ''wl_surface''{{snd}} an object representing a rectangular area on the screen, defined by a location, size and pixel content\n* ''wl_buffer''{{snd}} an object that, when attached to a ''wl_surface'' object, provides its displayable content\n* ''wl_output''{{snd}} an object representing the displayable area of a screen\n* ''wl_pointer'', ''wl_keyboard'', ''wl_touch''{{snd}} objects representing different input devices like [[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointers]] or [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]]\n* ''wl_seat''{{snd}} an object representing a seat (a set of input/output devices) in [[multiseat configuration]]s\n\nA typical Wayland client session starts by opening a connection to the compositor using the ''wl_display'' object. This is a special local object that represents the connection and does not live within the server. By using its interface the client can request the ''wl_registry'' global object from the compositor, where all the global object names live, and bind those that the client is interested in. Usually the client binds at least a ''wl_compositor'' object from where it will request one or more ''wl_surface'' objects to show the application output on the display.{{r|Paalanen 2014}}\n\n====Wayland extension interfaces====\nA Wayland compositor can define and export its own additional interfaces.{{r|Wayland doc|page=10}} This feature is used to extend the protocol beyond the basic functionality provided by the core interfaces, and has become the standard way to implement Wayland protocol extensions. Certain compositors can choose to add custom interfaces to provide specialized or unique features. The Wayland reference compositor, Weston, used them to implement new experimental interfaces as a testbed for new concepts and ideas, some of which later became part of the core protocol (such as ''wl_subsurface'' interface added in Wayland 1.4{{r|wayland 1.4}}).\n\n===Extension protocols to the core protocol===\n\n====XDG-Shell protocol====\nXDG-Shell protocol (see [[freedesktop.org]] for XDG) is an extended way to manage surfaces under Wayland compositors (not only Weston). The traditional way to manipulate (maximize, minimize, fullscreen, etc.) surfaces is to use the wl_shell_*() functions, which are part of the core Wayland protocol and live in <tt>libwayland-client</tt>. An implementation of the xdg-shell protocol, on the contrary, is supposed to be provided by the Wayland compositor. So you will find the <tt>xdg-shell-client-protocol.h</tt> header in the Weston source tree. Each Wayland compositor is supposed to provide its own implementation.\n\n{{As of|2014|6}}, XDG-Shell protocol was not versioned and still prone to changes.\n\nxdg_shell is a protocol aimed to substitute wl_shell in the long term, but will not be part of the Wayland core protocol. It starts as a non-stable API, aimed to be used as a development place at first, and once features are defined as required by several desktop shells, it can be finally made stable. It provides mainly two new interfaces: xdg_surface and xdg_popup. The xdg_surface interface implements a desktop-style window that can be moved, resized, maximized, etc.; it provides a request for creating child/parent relationship. The xdg_popup interface implements a desktop-style popup/menu; an xdg_popup is always transient for another surface, and also has implicit grab.{{r|xdg-shell}}\n\n====IVI-Shell protocol====\nIVI-Shell is an extension to the Wayland core protocol, targeting [[in-vehicle infotainment]] (IVI) devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/GENIVI/wayland-ivi-extension|title=GENIVI/wayland-ivi-extension|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Rendering model===\n[[File:The Linux Graphics Stack and glamor.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|[[Wayland compositor]] and its clients use [[EGL (API)|EGL]] to draw directly into the [[framebuffer]]; [[X.Org Server]] with [[XWayland]] and [[Glamor (software)|Glamor]].]]\n\nThe Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}}{{r|Wayland FAQ}}{{r|Vervloesem 2012}}{{r|Barnes slides|p=2}} Instead, Wayland follows a ''direct rendering'' model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}} For that purpose, the client can choose to do all the rendering by itself, use a rendering library like [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] or [[OpenGL]], or rely on the rendering engine of high-level widget libraries with Wayland support, such as [[Qt (software)|Qt]] or [[GTK]]. The client can also optionally use other specialized libraries to perform specific tasks, such as [[Freetype]] for [[Font rasterization|font rendering]].\n\nThe resulting buffer with the rendered window contents are stored in a ''wl_buffer'' object. The internal type of this object is implementation dependent. The only requirement is that the content data must be shareable between the client and the compositor. If the client uses a software (CPU) renderer and the result is stored in the [[Main memory|system memory]], then client and compositor can use [[shared memory]] to implement the buffer communication without extra copies. The Wayland protocol already natively provides this kind of shared memory buffer through the ''wl_shm'' and ''wl_shm_pool'' interfaces.{{r|Wayland doc|page=11, 20-21}} The drawback of this method is that the compositor may need to do additional work (usually to copy the shared data to the GPU) to display it, which leads to slower graphics performance.\n\nThe most typical case is for the client to render directly into a [[video memory]] buffer using a hardware (GPU) accelerated API such as [[OpenGL]], [[OpenGL ES]] or [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]]. Client and compositor can share this GPU-space buffer using a special handler to reference it.{{r|Paalanen 2012}} This method allows the compositor to avoid additional copies of data to the GPU, resulting in faster graphics performance than using shm buffers, and is therefore the preferred one. The compositor can further optimize the composition of the final scene to be shown on the display by using the same hardware acceleration API as the client.\n\nWhen rendering is completed in a shared buffer, the Wayland client should instruct the compositor to present the rendered contents of the buffer on the display. For this purpose, the client binds the buffer object that stores the rendered contents to the surface object, and sends a \"commit\" request to the surface, transferring the effective control of the buffer to the compositor.{{r|hellowl}} Then the client waits for the compositor to release the buffer (signaled by an event) if it wants to reuse the buffer to render another frame, or it can use another buffer to render the new frame, and, when the rendering is finished, bind this new buffer to the surface and commit its contents.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}} The procedure used for rendering, including the number of buffers involved and their management, is entirely under the client control.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}}\n\n==Comparison with other window systems==\n{{See also|Mir (software)#Software architecture|label 1=Mir software architecture|Mir (software)#Controversy|label 2=Controversy around Mir}}\n\n===Differences between Wayland and X===\nThere are several differences between Wayland and X in regards to performance, code maintainability, and security:{{r|Griffith 2013}}\n\n; Architecture : The [[Compositing window manager|composition manager]] is a separate, additional feature in X, while Wayland merges display server and compositor as a single function.{{r|Wayland architecture}}{{r|Vervloesem 2012}} Also, it incorporates some of the tasks of the [[window manager]], which in X is a separate client-side process.{{r|Edge 2012}}\n\n; Compositing : Compositing is optional in X, but mandatory in Wayland. Compositing in X is \"active\"; that is, the compositor must fetch all pixel data, which introduces latency. In Wayland, compositing is \"passive\", which means the compositor receives pixel data directly from clients.{{r|Wayland Compositor|pages=8-11}}\n\n; Rendering : The X server itself is able to perform rendering, although it can also be instructed to display a rendered window sent by a client. In contrast, Wayland does not expose any API for rendering, but delegates to clients such tasks (including the rendering of fonts, widgets, etc.).{{r|Wayland architecture}}{{r|Vervloesem 2012}} Window decorations can be rendered on the client side (e.g., by a graphics toolkit) or on the server side (by the compositor).{{r|Graesslin 2013 decorations}}\n\n; Security : Wayland isolates the input and output of every window, achieving confidentiality, integrity and availability in both cases; the original X design lacks these important security features,{{r|Kerrisk 2012}}{{r|Peres 2014}}{{r|Graesslin 2015 security}} although some extensions have been developed trying to mitigate it.{{r|X.Org Security}}{{r|X11 Security extension}}{{r|XACE}} Also, with the vast majority of the code running in the client, less code needs to run with ''root'' privileges, improving security,{{r|Kerrisk 2012}} although multiple popular Linux distributions now allow X to be run without root privileges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Debian-Non-Root-X|title=Debian Moves To Non-Root X.Org Server By Default - Phoronix|website=www.phoronix.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Non_root_Xorg|title=Non root Xorg - Gentoo Wiki|website=wiki.gentoo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Rootless|title=X/Rootless - Ubuntu Wiki|website=wiki.ubuntu.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1078902|title=1078902 \u2013 Xorg without root rights|website=bugzilla.redhat.com}}</ref>\n\n; Inter-process communication : The X server provides a basic communication method between X clients, later extended by [[ICCCM]] conventions. This X client-to-client communication is used by window managers and also to implement [[X session manager|X sessions]], [[X Window selection|selections and drag-and-drop]], and other features. The Wayland core protocol does not support communication between wayland clients at all, and the corresponding functionality (if needed) should be implemented by the [[desktop environments]] (like KDE or GNOME), or by a third party (for example, by using native [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] of the underlying operating system).\n\n; Networking : The X Window System is an [[X Window System protocols and architecture|architecture]] that was designed at its core to run over a network. Wayland does not offer network transparency by itself;{{r|Wayland FAQ}} however, a compositor can implement any [[List of remote desktop protocols|remote desktop protocol]] to achieve remote display. In addition, there is research into Wayland image streaming and compression that would provide remote frame buffer access similar to that of [[VNC]].{{r|Willis 2013}}\n\n===Compatibility with X===\n[[File:XWayland.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A screenshot showing xwayland]]\n\n[[XWayland]] is an [[X Window System|X Server]] running as a Wayland client, and thus is capable of displaying native X11 client applications in a Wayland compositor environment.{{r|xwayland}} This is similar to the way [[XQuartz]] runs X applications in [[macOS]]\u2019s native windowing system. The goal of XWayland is to facilitate the transition from X Window System to Wayland environments, providing a way to run unported applications in the meantime. XWayland was mainlined into [[X.Org Server]] version 1.16.{{r|xorg 1.16}}\n\nWidget toolkits such as [[Qt (software)|Qt]]5 and [[GTK]]3 can switch their graphical back-end at run time,{{r|H\u00f8gsberg 2011 GTK}} allowing users to choose at [[load time]] whether they want to run the application over X or over Wayland.

It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and published under the [[MIT License]]. Weston has official support for only the [[Linux]] operating system due to Weston's dependence on certain features of the [[Linux kernel]], such as [[KMS driver|kernel mode-setting]], [[Graphics Execution Manager]] (GEM), and [[udev]], which have not been implemented in other Unix-like operating systems.{{r|wayland README}} When running on Linux, handling of the input hardware relies on [[evdev]], while the handling of buffers relies on [[Generic Buffer Management]] (GBM). However, in 2013 a prototype port of Weston to [[FreeBSD]] was announced.{{r|Larabel 2013 freebsd}}\n\nWeston supports [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/merge_requests/48/diffs?commit_id=05dc6b86431fe040f91ca7b4cf122fa9dc4dd8dd|title=Adding Content protection support in drm-backend (!48) \u00b7 Merge Requests \u00b7 wayland / weston|website=GitLab|language=en|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n\nWeston relies on GEM to share application buffers between the compositor and applications. It contains a plug-in system of \"shells\" for common desktop features like docks and panels.{{r|Willis 2013}} Clients are responsible for the drawing of their window borders and their decorations. For rendering, Weston can use [[OpenGL ES]]{{r|Paalanen 2012 EGL}} or the pixman library to do [[software rendering]].{{r|Larabel 2013 pixman}} The full OpenGL implementation is not used, because on most current systems, installing the full OpenGL libraries would also install [[GLX]] and other [[X Window System]] support libraries as dependencies.{{r|H\u00f8gsberg wayland GL}}\n\nA remote access interface for Weston was proposed in October 2013 by a [[RealVNC]] employee.{{r|RealVNC remote}}\n\n====Maynard====\n''Maynard'' is a [[graphical shell]] and has been written as a plug-in for Weston, just as the [[GNOME Shell]] has been written as a plug-in to [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]].{{r|maynard}}\n\n===libinput===\n[[File:Libinput for Wayland compositors.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|libinput was created to consolidate the input stack across multiple Wayland compositors.]]\n\nThe Weston code for handling input devices (keyboards, pointers, touch screens, etc.) was split into its own separate library, called ''libinput'', for which support was first merged in Weston&nbsp;1.5.{{r|wayland 1.5}}{{r|libinput announce}}\n\nLibinput handles input devices for multiple Wayland compositors and also provides a generic [[X.Org Server]] input driver. It aims to provide one implementation for multiple Wayland compositors with a common way to handle input events while minimizing the amount of custom input code compositors need to include. libinput provides device detection{{clarify|reason=both input and output devices?|date=December 2016}} (via [[udev]]), device handling, input device event processing and abstraction.{{r|libinput}}{{r|XDC2014 libinput}}\n\nVersion 1.0 of libinput followed version 0.21, and included support for tablets, button sets and touchpad gestures. This version will maintain stable API/ABI.{{r|libinput stable API}}\n\nAs GNOME/GTK and [[KDE Frameworks 5]]{{r|autoref0004}} have mainlined the required changes, Fedora&nbsp;22 will replace X.Org's evdev and Synaptics drivers with libinput.{{r|libinput fedora 22}}\n\nWith version 1.16, the [[X.Org Server]] obtained support for the [[libinput]] library in form of a wrapper called <tt>xf86-input-libinput</tt>.{{r|Hutterer 2014}}{{r|libinputfosdem15}}\n\n===Wayland Security Module===\nWayland Security Module is a proposition that resembles the [[Linux Security Module]] interface found in the [[Linux kernel]].{{r|XDC2014 wayland security}}\n\nSome applications (especially the ones related to [[accessibility]]) require privileged capabilities that should work across different Wayland compositors. Currently,{{When|date=October 2014}} applications under Wayland are generally unable to perform any sensitive tasks such as taking screenshots or injecting input events. Wayland developers are actively looking for feasible ways to handle privileged clients securely and then designing privileged interfaces for them.\n\nWayland Security Module is a way to delegate security decisions within the compositor to a centralized security decision engine.{{r|XDC2014 wayland security}}\n\n==Adoption==\nThe Wayland protocol is designed to be simple so that additional protocols and interfaces need to be defined and implemented to achieve a holistic windowing system. As of July 2014 these additional interfaces were being worked on. So, while the toolkits already fully support Wayland, the developers of the [[graphical shell]]s are cooperating with the Wayland developers creating the necessary additional interfaces.\n\n===Desktop Linux distributions===\n{{Outdated section|date=March 2020}}\nIn general, out-of-the-box support for a full desktop running Wayland in major Linux distributions is still in early stages.{{When?|date=April 2019}} Most Linux distributions that ship version 3.20 or newer of the Gnome desktop environment support manually installing a Wayland session, and in case of Gnome 3.22 or newer might default to Wayland.

transparency argument|last=H\u00f8gsberg|first=Kristian|date=9 November 2010|quote=Wayland isn't a remote rendering API like X, but that doesn't exclude network transparency. Clients render into a shared buffer and then have to tell the compositor (...) what they changed. The compositor can then send the new pixels in that region out over the network. The Wayland protocol is already violently asynchronous, so it should be able to handle a bit of network lag gracefully. Remote fullscreen video viewing or gaming isn't going to work well, [but] I don't know any other display system that handles that well and transparently.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Jackson remotewl\">{{cite

the communication between a [[display server]] and its clients, as well as a [[C (programming language)|C]] library implementation of that protocol.{{r|Wayland homepage}} A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a ''[[#Wayland compositors|Wayland compositor]]'', because it additionally performs the task of a [[compositing window manager]].\n\nWayland is developed by a group of volunteers initially led by Kristian H\u00f8gsberg as a [[free software|free]] and [[Open-source software|open-source]] community-driven project with the aim of replacing the [[X Window System]] with a modern, secure, simpler [[windowing system]] in [[Linux]] and other [[Unix-like]] operating systems.{{r|Wayland homepage}} The project's source code is published under the terms of the [[MIT License]], a [[permissive free software licence]].{{r|Wayland FAQ}}{{r|License}}\n\nAs part of its efforts, the Wayland project also develops a [[reference implementation]] of a Wayland compositor called ''[[#Weston|Weston]]''.{{r|Wayland homepage}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Wayland display server protocol.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|{{ordered list\n| The [[evdev]] module of the [[Linux kernel]] gets an event and sends it to the [[Wayland compositor]].\n| The Wayland compositor looks through its [[scenegraph]] to determine which window should receive the event. The scenegraph corresponds to what is on screen and the Wayland compositor understands the transformations that it may have applied to the elements in the scenegraph. Thus, the Wayland compositor can pick the right window and transform the screen coordinates to window local coordinates, by applying the inverse transformations. The types of transformation that can be applied to a window is only restricted to what the compositor can do, as long as it can compute the inverse transformation for the input events.\n| As in the X case, when the client receives the event, it updates the UI in response. But in the Wayland case, the rendering happens by the client via [[EGL (API)|EGL]], and the client just sends a request to the compositor to indicate the region that was updated.\n| The Wayland compositor collects damage requests from its clients and then re-composites the screen. The compositor can then directly issue an [[ioctl]] to schedule a pageflip with [[KMS (Linux kernel)|KMS]].}}]]\n\nStarting around 2010, Linux desktop graphics has moved from having \"a pile of [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] interfaces... all talking to the [[display server|X server]], which is at the center of the universe\" towards putting the Linux kernel and its components (i.e. [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)]], [[Direct Rendering Manager|Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)]]) \"in the middle\", with \"window systems like X and Wayland ... off in the corner\". This will be \"a much-simplified graphics system offering more flexibility and better performance\".{{r|Corbet 2010}}\n\nKristian H\u00f8gsberg could have added an [[Xdmx|extension to X]] as many recent projects have done, but preferred to \"[push] X out of the hotpath between clients and the hardware\" for reasons explained in the project's FAQ:{{r|Wayland FAQ}}\n\n{{quote|What\u2019s different now is that a lot of infrastructure has moved from the [[display server|X server]] into the kernel (memory management, command scheduling, [[mode-setting|mode setting]]) or libraries ([[cairo (graphics)|cairo]], pixman, [[freetype]], [[fontconfig]], [[pango]], etc.), and there is very little left that has to happen in a central server process. ... [An X server has] a tremendous amount of functionality that you must support to claim to speak the X protocol, yet nobody will ever use this. ... This includes code tables, glyph rasterization and caching, [[X logical font description|XLFDs]] (seriously, XLFDs!), and the entire core rendering API that lets you draw stippled lines, polygons, wide arcs and many more state-of-the-1980s style graphics primitives. For many things we've been able to keep the X.org server modern by adding extension such as [[XRandR]], [[XRender]] and [[composite (graphics)|COMPOSITE]] ... With Wayland we can move the X server and all its legacy technology to an optional code path. Getting to a point where the X server is a compatibility option instead of the core rendering system will take a while, but we'll never get there if [we] don\u2019t plan for it.}}\n\nWayland consists of a protocol and a reference implementation named [[#Weston|Weston]]. The project is also developing versions of [[GTK]] and [[Qt (software)|Qt]] that render to Wayland instead of to X. Most applications are expected to gain support for Wayland through one of these libraries without modification to the application.\n\nInitial versions of Wayland have not provided [[network transparency]], though H\u00f8gsberg noted in 2010 that network transparency is possible.{{r|H\u00f8gsberg remotewl}}\nIt was attempted as a [[Google Summer of Code]] project in 2011, but was not successful.{{r|Larabel 2011 remote}}\nAdam Jackson has envisioned providing remote access to a Wayland application by either \"pixel-scraping\" (like [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]]) or getting it to send a \"rendering command stream\" across the network (as in [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]], [[SPICE (protocol)|SPICE]] or [[X Window System|X11]]).{{r|Jackson remotewl}} As of early 2013, H\u00f8gsberg is experimenting with network transparency using a proxy Wayland server which sends compressed images to the real compositor.{{r|Stone 2013 LCA}}{{r|Willis 2013}} In August 2017, GNOME saw the first such pixel-scraping VNC server implementation under Wayland.{{r|GNOME Remote Desktop}}\n\n==Software architecture==\n\n===Protocol architecture===\n[[File:Wayland protocol architecture.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|In the Wayland protocol architecture, a client and a compositor communicate through the Wayland protocol using the reference implementation libraries.]]\n\nWayland protocol follows a [[client\u2013server model]] in which clients are the graphical applications requesting the display of pixel buffers on the screen, and the server (compositor) is the service provider controlling the display of these buffers.\n\nThe Wayland reference implementation has been designed as a two-layer protocol:{{r|hellowl}}\n* A low-level layer or ''wire protocol'' that handles the [[inter-process communication]] between the two involved [[Process (computing)|processes]]{{mdashb}}client and compositor{{mdashb}}and the [[Marshalling (computer science)|marshalling]] of the data that they interchange. This layer is message-based and usually implemented using the kernel IPC services, specifically [[Unix domain sockets]] in the case of [[Linux]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems.{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}}\n* A high-level layer built upon it, that handles the information that client and compositor need to exchange to implement the basic features of a [[window system]]. This layer is implemented as \"an asynchronous object-oriented protocol\".{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}}\n\nWhile the low-level layer was written manually in [[C (programming language)|C]], the high-level layer is automatically generated from a description of the elements of the protocol stored in [[XML]] format.{{r|wlprotoxml}} Every time the protocol description of this XML file changes, the C source code that implements such protocol can be regenerated to include the new changes, allowing a very flexible, extensible and error-proof protocol.\n\nThe reference implementation of Wayland protocol is split in two [[Library (computing)|libraries]]: a library to be used by Wayland clients called <code>libwayland-client</code> and a library to be used by Wayland compositors called <code>libwayland-server</code>.{{r|Wayland doc|page=57}}\n\n===Protocol overview===\nThe Wayland protocol is described as an \"asynchronous [[object-oriented]] protocol\".{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}} ''Object-oriented'' means that the services offered by the compositor are presented as a series of ''objects'' living on the same compositor. Each object implements an ''interface'' which has a name, a number of methods (called ''requests'') as well as several associated ''events''. Every request and event has zero or more arguments, each one with a name and a [[data type]]. The protocol is ''asynchronous'' in the sense that requests do not have to wait for synchronized replies or [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|ACKs]], avoiding [[round-trip delay time]] and achieving improved performance.\n\nThe Wayland clients can make a request (a method invocation) on some object if the object's interface supports that request. The client must also supply the required data for the arguments of such request. This is the way the clients request services from the compositor. The compositor in turn sends information back to the client by causing the object to emit events (probably with arguments too). These events can be emitted by the compositor as a response to a certain request, or asynchronously, subject to the occurrence of internal events (such as one from an input device) or state changes. The error conditions are also signaled as events by the compositor.{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}}\n\nFor a client to be able to make a request to an object, it first needs to tell the server the ID number it will use to identify that object.{{r|Wayland doc|page=9}} There are two types of objects in the compositor: global objects and non-global objects. Global objects are advertised by the compositor to the clients when they are created (and also when they are destroyed), while non-global objects are usually created by other objects that already exist as part of their functionality.{{r|Paalanen 2014}}\n\nThe interfaces and their requests and events are the core elements that define the Wayland protocol. Each version of the protocol includes a set of interfaces, along with their requests and events, which are expected to be in any Wayland compositor. Optionally, a Wayland compositor may define and implement its own interfaces that support new requests and events, thereby extending functionality beyond the core protocol.{{r|Wayland doc|page=10}} To facilitate changes to the protocol, each interface contains a \"version number\" attribute in addition to its name; this attribute allows for distinguishing variants of the same interface. Each Wayland compositor exposes not only what interfaces are available, but also the supported versions of those interfaces.{{r|Wayland doc|page=12}}\n\n====Wayland core interfaces====\nThe interfaces of the current version of Wayland protocol are defined in the file <tt>protocol/wayland.xml</tt> of the Wayland source code.{{r|wlprotoxml}} This is an [[XML]] file that lists the existing interfaces in the current version, along with their requests, events and other attributes. This set of interfaces is the minimum required to be implemented by any Wayland compositor.\n\nSome of the most basic interfaces of the Wayland protocol are:{{r|Wayland doc|pages=10-12}}\n* ''wl_display''{{snd}} the core global object, a special object to encapsulate the Wayland protocol itself\n* ''wl_registry''{{snd}} the global registry object, in which the compositor registers all the global objects that it wants to be available to all clients\n* ''wl_compositor''{{snd}} an object that represents the compositor, and is in charge of combining the different surfaces into one output\n* ''wl_surface''{{snd}} an object representing a rectangular area on the screen, defined by a location, size and pixel content\n* ''wl_buffer''{{snd}} an object that, when attached to a ''wl_surface'' object, provides its displayable content\n* ''wl_output''{{snd}} an object representing the displayable area of a screen\n* ''wl_pointer'', ''wl_keyboard'', ''wl_touch''{{snd}} objects representing different input devices like [[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)|pointers]] or [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]]\n* ''wl_seat''{{snd}} an object representing a seat (a set of input/output devices) in [[multiseat configuration]]s\n\nA typical Wayland client session starts by opening a connection to the compositor using the ''wl_display'' object. This is a special local object that represents the connection and does not live within the server. By using its interface the client can request the ''wl_registry'' global object from the compositor, where all the global object names live, and bind those that the client is interested in. Usually the client binds at least a ''wl_compositor'' object from where it will request one or more ''wl_surface'' objects to show the application output on the display.{{r|Paalanen 2014}}\n\n====Wayland extension interfaces====\nA Wayland compositor can define and export its own additional interfaces.{{r|Wayland doc|page=10}} This feature is used to extend the protocol beyond the basic functionality provided by the core interfaces, and has become the standard way to implement Wayland protocol extensions. Certain compositors can choose to add custom interfaces to provide specialized or unique features. The Wayland reference compositor, Weston, used them to implement new experimental interfaces as a testbed for new concepts and ideas, some of which later became part of the core protocol (such as ''wl_subsurface'' interface added in Wayland 1.4{{r|wayland 1.4}}).\n\n===Extension protocols to the core protocol===\n\n====XDG-Shell protocol====\nXDG-Shell protocol (see [[freedesktop.org]] for XDG) is an extended way to manage surfaces under Wayland compositors (not only Weston). The traditional way to manipulate (maximize, minimize, fullscreen, etc.) surfaces is to use the wl_shell_*() functions, which are part of the core Wayland protocol and live in <tt>libwayland-client</tt>. An implementation of the xdg-shell protocol, on the contrary, is supposed to be provided by the Wayland compositor. So you will find the <tt>xdg-shell-client-protocol.h</tt> header in the Weston source tree. Each Wayland compositor is supposed to provide its own implementation.\n\n{{As of|2014|6}}, XDG-Shell protocol was not versioned and still prone to changes.\n\nxdg_shell is a protocol aimed to substitute wl_shell in the long term, but will not be part of the Wayland core protocol. It starts as a non-stable API, aimed to be used as a development place at first, and once features are defined as required by several desktop shells, it can be finally made stable. It provides mainly two new interfaces: xdg_surface and xdg_popup. The xdg_surface interface implements a desktop-style window that can be moved, resized, maximized, etc.; it provides a request for creating child/parent relationship. The xdg_popup interface implements a desktop-style popup/menu; an xdg_popup is always transient for another surface, and also has implicit grab.{{r|xdg-shell}}\n\n====IVI-Shell protocol====\nIVI-Shell is an extension to the Wayland core protocol, targeting [[in-vehicle infotainment]] (IVI) devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/GENIVI/wayland-ivi-extension|title=GENIVI/wayland-ivi-extension|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Rendering model===\n[[File:The Linux Graphics Stack and glamor.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|[[Wayland compositor]] and its clients use [[EGL (API)|EGL]] to draw directly into the [[framebuffer]]; [[X.Org Server]] with [[XWayland]] and [[Glamor (software)|Glamor]].]]\n\nThe Wayland protocol does not include a rendering API.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}}{{r|Wayland FAQ}}{{r|Vervloesem 2012}}{{r|Barnes slides|p=2}} Instead, Wayland follows a ''direct rendering'' model, in which the client must render the window contents to a buffer shareable with the compositor.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}} For that purpose, the client can choose to do all the rendering by itself, use a rendering library like [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] or [[OpenGL]], or rely on the rendering engine of high-level widget libraries with Wayland support, such as [[Qt (software)|Qt]] or [[GTK]]. The client can also optionally use other specialized libraries to perform specific tasks, such as [[Freetype]] for [[Font rasterization|font rendering]].\n\nThe resulting buffer with the rendered window contents are stored in a ''wl_buffer'' object. The internal type of this object is implementation dependent. The only requirement is that the content data must be shareable between the client and the compositor. If the client uses a software (CPU) renderer and the result is stored in the [[Main memory|system memory]], then client and compositor can use [[shared memory]] to implement the buffer communication without extra copies. The Wayland protocol already natively provides this kind of shared memory buffer through the ''wl_shm'' and ''wl_shm_pool'' interfaces.{{r|Wayland doc|page=11, 20-21}} The drawback of this method is that the compositor may need to do additional work (usually to copy the shared data to the GPU) to display it, which leads to slower graphics performance.\n\nThe most typical case is for the client to render directly into a [[video memory]] buffer using a hardware (GPU) accelerated API such as [[OpenGL]], [[OpenGL ES]] or [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]]. Client and compositor can share this GPU-space buffer using a special handler to reference it.{{r|Paalanen 2012}} This method allows the compositor to avoid additional copies of data to the GPU, resulting in faster graphics performance than using shm buffers, and is therefore the preferred one. The compositor can further optimize the composition of the final scene to be shown on the display by using the same hardware acceleration API as the client.\n\nWhen rendering is completed in a shared buffer, the Wayland client should instruct the compositor to present the rendered contents of the buffer on the display. For this purpose, the client binds the buffer object that stores the rendered contents to the surface object, and sends a \"commit\" request to the surface, transferring the effective control of the buffer to the compositor.{{r|hellowl}} Then the client waits for the compositor to release the buffer (signaled by an event) if it wants to reuse the buffer to render another frame, or it can use another buffer to render the new frame, and, when the rendering is finished, bind this new buffer to the surface and commit its contents.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}} The procedure used for rendering, including the number of buffers involved and their management, is entirely under the client control.{{r|Wayland doc|page=7}}\n\n==Comparison with other window systems==\n{{See also|Mir (software)#Software architecture|label 1=Mir software architecture|Mir (software)#Controversy|label 2=Controversy around Mir}}\n\n===Differences between Wayland and X===\nThere are several differences between Wayland and X in regards to performance, code maintainability, and security:{{r|Griffith 2013}}\n\n; Architecture : The [[Compositing window manager|composition manager]] is a separate, additional feature in X, while Wayland merges display server and compositor as a single function.{{r|Wayland architecture}}{{r|Vervloesem 2012}} Also, it incorporates some of the tasks of the [[window manager]], which in X is a separate client-side process.{{r|Edge 2012}}\n\n; Compositing : Compositing is optional in X, but mandatory in Wayland. Compositing in X is \"active\"; that is, the compositor must fetch all pixel data, which introduces latency. In Wayland, compositing is \"passive\", which means the compositor receives pixel data directly from clients.{{r|Wayland Compositor|pages=8-11}}\n\n; Rendering : The X server itself is able to perform rendering, although it can also be instructed to display a rendered window sent by a client. In contrast, Wayland does not expose any API for rendering, but delegates to clients such tasks (including the rendering of fonts, widgets, etc.).{{r|Wayland architecture}}{{r|Vervloesem 2012}} Window decorations can be rendered on the client side (e.g., by a graphics toolkit) or on the server side (by the compositor).{{r|Graesslin 2013 decorations}}\n\n; Security : Wayland isolates the input and output of every window, achieving confidentiality, integrity and availability in both cases; the original X design lacks these important security features,{{r|Kerrisk 2012}}{{r|Peres 2014}}{{r|Graesslin 2015 security}} although some extensions have been developed trying to mitigate it.{{r|X.Org Security}}{{r|X11 Security extension}}{{r|XACE}} Also, with the vast majority of the code running in the client, less code needs to run with ''root'' privileges, improving security,{{r|Kerrisk 2012}} although multiple popular Linux distributions now allow X to be run without root privileges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Debian-Non-Root-X|title=Debian Moves To Non-Root X.Org Server By Default - Phoronix|website=www.phoronix.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Non_root_Xorg|title=Non root Xorg - Gentoo Wiki|website=wiki.gentoo.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Rootless|title=X/Rootless - Ubuntu Wiki|website=wiki.ubuntu.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1078902|title=1078902 \u2013 Xorg without root rights|website=bugzilla.redhat.com}}</ref>\n\n; Inter-process communication : The X server provides a basic communication method between X clients, later extended by [[ICCCM]] conventions. This X client-to-client communication is used by window managers and also to implement [[X session manager|X sessions]], [[X Window selection|selections and drag-and-drop]], and other features. The Wayland core protocol does not support communication between wayland clients at all, and the corresponding functionality (if needed) should be implemented by the [[desktop environments]] (like KDE or GNOME), or by a third party (for example, by using native [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] of the underlying operating system).\n\n; Networking : The X Window System is an [[X Window System protocols and architecture|architecture]] that was designed at its core to run over a network. Wayland does not offer network transparency by itself;{{r|Wayland FAQ}} however, a compositor can implement any [[List of remote desktop protocols|remote desktop protocol]] to achieve remote display. In addition, there is research into Wayland image streaming and compression that would provide remote frame buffer access similar to that of [[VNC]].{{r|Willis 2013}}\n\n===Compatibility with X===\n[[File:XWayland.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A screenshot showing xwayland]]\n\n[[XWayland]] is an [[X Window System|X Server]] running as a Wayland client, and thus is capable of displaying native X11 client applications in a Wayland compositor environment.{{r|xwayland}} This is similar to the way [[XQuartz]] runs X applications in [[macOS]]\u2019s native windowing system. The goal of XWayland is to facilitate the transition from X Window System to Wayland environments, providing a way to run unported applications in the meantime. XWayland was mainlined into [[X.Org Server]] version 1.16.{{r|xorg 1.16}}\n\nWidget toolkits such as [[Qt (software)|Qt]]5 and [[GTK]]3 can switch their graphical back-end at run time,{{r|H\u00f8gsberg 2011 GTK}} allowing users to choose at [[load time]] whether they want to run the application over X or over Wayland.

Currently,{{When|date=October 2014}} applications under Wayland are generally unable to perform any sensitive tasks such as taking screenshots or injecting input events. Wayland developers are actively looking for feasible ways to handle privileged clients securely and then designing privileged interfaces for them.\n\nWayland Security Module is a way to delegate security decisions within the compositor to a centralized security decision engine.{{r|XDC2014 wayland security}}\n\n==Adoption==\nThe Wayland protocol is designed to be simple so that additional protocols and interfaces need to be defined and implemented to achieve a holistic windowing system. As of July 2014 these additional interfaces were being worked on. So, while the toolkits already fully support Wayland, the developers of the [[graphical shell]]s are cooperating with the Wayland developers creating the necessary additional interfaces.\n\n===Desktop Linux distributions===\n{{Outdated section|date=March 2020}}\nIn general, out-of-the-box support for a full desktop running Wayland in major Linux distributions is still in early stages.{{When?|date=April 2019}} Most Linux distributions that ship version 3.20 or newer of the Gnome desktop environment support manually installing a Wayland session, and in case of Gnome 3.22 or newer might default to Wayland.

Clients render into a shared buffer and then have to tell the compositor (...) what they changed. The compositor can then send the new pixels in that region out over the network. The Wayland protocol is already violently asynchronous, so it should be able to handle a bit of network lag gracefully. Remote fullscreen video viewing or gaming isn't going to work well, [but] I don't know any other display system that handles that well and transparently.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Jackson remotewl\">{{cite

The word ''''Sood'''' finds a mention in the Vedas at 23 places (15 places in the Rig Ved, 6 places in the Yajur Ved and twice in the Atharva Ved). Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Madhusudan' \u2013 (Sudan means 'sanharak' \u2013 killer of demon Madhu). The Sood community is a very ancient fraternity and some Sood/Sud gotras are merchants as well. \n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Brahmin Rishis were perturbed by the spread of Buddhism across India, because the old Vedic Hindu Dharma was getting a great set back. Hence, the Rishis performed a sacred Yajna at Mount Abu to revive old Hindu Dharma based on the Vedic traditions. The sacred flames of this Agni Kund, incarnated and baptised four Kshatriyas namely \u2013 the Parmar, the Parihar, the Solanki and the Chouhan. These four took a holy vow to re-establish the ancient glory of Hindu Dharma by fighting against the mass change of faith from Hinduism to Buddhism. These four Kshatriyas spread four new branches of Hinduism all over the country. The second son born to Parmar was named Sood and his descendents formed the Sood community. A reference of 44 descendants of Parmar is also available. These sood descendents formed the Sood Dynasty and the capital city of the Sood Dynasty for eight generations was Patten in Sind, now in Pakistan. The capital was later shifted to Alwar and finally King Jai Singh, (son of King Dahar) shifted his capital to Amar Kot, now in Pakistan. There is a reference of 101 Sood Kings or Rajas ruling in different parts of India. The Soods established themselves in the North and later got concentrated at Soodpur, now renamed Sirhind.  \n\nDue to the seven invasions of India by Ahmed Shah Abdali between 1748 and 1757 A.D., at Soodpur and gradually into Rajasthan and later of entire India, the Soods fled to different villages and towns in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.<ref name=\"originHistory\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#2|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Gotras or Sub Castes==\nBoth the Punjab section and the Hill section of the Sood community have 52 Gotras or Sub Castes each, many of which are named after the villages they settled in. <ref name=\"Gotras or Sub Castes\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#8|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Punjab section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Badhoo, Balgan, Baranwal, Behal, Beri, Bharak, Bhokaha (or Bhokhi), Bhola, Bodhi, Bourie, Brahmi, Dadan, Dauli (or Deli), Dhalli (or Dhati), Dhanda, Dhaunchak, Dhiri, Dhookhi, Dhoop, Dosaj, Gajri, Gajja (or Gajjey), Gondal (Gandel), Gopal, Goyal, Jandpal (or Janpal), Jari, Kajla (or Kajley), Lau, Mahidhar, Mahiyar (or Mayor), Makaura (or Makaurey), Mandal, Mohindra, Mohni, Mukandi, Momman, Nandoo, Nehra, Paal, Phakka, Pharwaha, Phassi, Poora, Rora, Rohnir, Rodher, Sanwal, Sulhan, Tagaley, Teji, Udhar, Ugal-Virk or Virk and Vassan.\n\nThe Hill section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Bahil, Bajwaria, Banta, Bhagley, Bhagra, Basohal, Basalia, Butail, Chakahria, Chakaseday, Chamib, Chaudhri, Chaukand, Chaujar, Chehray, Chimia, Cheemrey, Chhabb, Chonolia, Dagan, Didi, Dhophmal, Doddal, Dogan, Dorela, Dunyal, Indoria, Harail, Haraloo, Indoria, Jallundhroo, Jaiswal, Jandranglu, Jhalya, Jhangra, Jehelghat, Kalandar, Kandal, Karol, Kataway, Kaunsal, Kutharia, Kuthiala, Lahespar, Lakhanty, Lamsay, Lama, Langey, Lasaria, Laserday, Lauriya, Ling, Mahdoodia, Mangwalich, Mariya, Mand, Masoob, Mehtay, Mithoo, Naggal, Nehdal, Pabba, Panbalia, Paptopay, Patopa, Pulkaha, Phagdey, Phalkolia, Sabloria, Sah, Saraup, Sawali, Shall, Takalo and Udhwal.\n\nThe Soods are organized into city specific chapters of their organization in many countries.
