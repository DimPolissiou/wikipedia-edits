It was [[Species description|described]] by [[Tryon Reakirt]] in 1867. Other common names for this species, depending on the region, include green hairstreak and elfin. ''C. xami'' is considered to be a very rare species of butterfly, and its typical range is in southern [[Arizona]] and [[Texas]] including down south to [[Guatemala]]. The [[Callophrys gryneus|juniper hairstreak]] and the [[Chlorostrymon simaethis|silver-banded hairstreak]] butterflies are similar species, but both differ significantly from ''C. xami'' in regards to the postmedian white line running across the butterfly wings.\n\n==Description==\n''C. xami'' is a tailed species of butterfly that has a wingspan range of 2.38 to 2.86&nbsp;cm. In appearance, the underside of the [[Insect wing|hindwing]] is yellowish green; the wing also contains the postmedian white line, which is the discernible colored line located [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] to the middle of the wing, that forms a W-shape toward the tails of the butterfly. Some species that appear similar to ''C. xami'' include the [[Callophrys gryneus|juniper hairstreak]] and the [[Chlorostrymon simaethis|silver-banded hairstreak]]. The major differences are that the juniper species lacks the sharp W mark in the postmedian white band while the silver-banded species has a broader silver-white postmedian line on the underside of the hindwing.<ref name=\"field guide to butterfly\">{{cite book|last1=Opler|first1=Paul A.|title=A Field Guide to Western Butterflies|date=1999|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0395791516|pages=218\u2013219|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ilL_XX1rbNoC&pg=PA5&dq=xami+hairstreak#v=onepage&q=xami%20hairstreak&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Geographic range and habitat==\n''C. xami'' is found primarily in the [[southern U.S.]], specifically the southern and southeastern parts of [[Arizona]] and [[central Texas]], and as far south as [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].

Another reason that males may leave their given territory is to search for better territory, such as territories that provide better resources or better access to mates.

Throughout the first developmental stage of the first instar, larvae body length ranges from 0.8 to 1.0&nbsp;mm. The larvae are variable in color based on age; in the case of the first instar, the body of the larvae, which is covered in tiny brownish hair follicles, is pale yellow in color with some shade of brown coloring the head portion. In the case of the second instar, the body of the larvae, now covered in tiny pinkish-red hair follicles, can range from yellow-green to pale pink in color.

Furthermore, [[Polygynandry|multiple mating]] is generally advantageous for male insects to increase the likelihood of producing more offspring.

After the female passes by, the male flies around and follows the female and a courtship flight dance in the air begins; at some point in this courtship flight, which lasts approximately 30 seconds, the male flies closely behind and slightly above the simultaneously flying female butterfly. Together, the male and female perch closely together on a plant, most likely the host plant ''Echeveria'', and the male butterfly assumes a position in front of the female with their heads facing each other. In terms of motion, the male continuously and aggressively flutters his wings while the female remains still with her wings closed. Eventually, the male butterfly moves into a position right next to the female, with the heads and tails of both butterflies aligned, and makes [[Lepidoptera genitalia|genital contact]] with the female. After copulation ends, which may last several hours, the male may return to perch on the plant whereas the female may leave the area, thus ending this cycle of the courtship process.<ref name=\"courtship\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Capinera|first1=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|date=Aug 11, 2008|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|location=Gale virtual reference library|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC|isbn=9781402062421}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q21249997}}\n\n[[Category:Callophrys|xami]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| image = \n| image_caption = \n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Arthropod]]a\n| classis = [[Insect]]a\n| ordo = [[Lepidoptera]]\n| familia = [[Lycaenidae]]\n| genus = ''[[Callophrys]]''\n| species = '''''C. xami'''''\n| binomial = ''Callophrys xami''\n| binomial_authority = [[Tryon Reakirt|Reakirt]], 1867\n}}\n'''''Callophrys xami''''', commonly referred to as the '''xami hairstreak''' or '''green hairstreak''', is a [[butterfly]] included in the subgenus ''Xamia'' and the genus ''[[Callophrys]]'' in the family [[Lycaenidae]].

As male-male competition is high, the exact nature of the relationship between male fitness and frequency of matings may be unclear due to [[sperm competition]], [[cryptic female choice]], and [[courtship display|cost to benefit ratio of mating]].<ref name=\"male territory\" /><ref name=\"courtship\">{{cite journal|last1=Cordero|first1=Carlos|title=The courtship behavior of Callophrys xami (Lycaenidae)|journal=J3o2u:r9n9a-1l 0o6f ,R1es9e9a3rch on the Lepidoptera|date=1993|volume=32|pages=99\u2013106|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267692912}}</ref><ref name=\"spermatophore\">{{cite journal|last1=Cordero|first1=Carlos|title=Is Spermatophore Number a Good Measure of Mating Frequency in Female Callophrys xami (Lycaenidae)?|journal=Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society|date=1999|volume=53|issue=4|pages=169\u2013170|url=http://images.peabody.yale.edu/lepsoc/jls/1990s/1999/1999-53(4)169-Cordero.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Typical courtship process===\nThe general process for a typical [[courtship display|courtship interaction]] begins when a female flies near a [[Perch (equilibristic)|perching]] male, who is most likely perched on the typical host plant of ''Echeveria gibbiflora''. After the female passes by, the male flies around and follows the female and a courtship flight dance in the air begins; at some point in this courtship flight, which lasts approximately 30 seconds, the male flies closely behind and slightly above the simultaneously flying female butterfly. Together, the male and female perch closely together on a plant, most likely the host plant ''Echeveria'', and the male butterfly assumes a position in front of the female with their heads facing each other. In terms of motion, the male continuously and aggressively flutters his wings while the female remains still with her wings closed. Eventually, the male butterfly moves into a position right next to the female, with the heads and tails of both butterflies aligned, and makes [[Lepidoptera genitalia|genital contact]] with the female. After copulation ends, which may last several hours, the male may return to perch on the plant whereas the female may leave the area, thus ending this cycle of the courtship process.<ref name=\"courtship\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Capinera|first1=John L.|title=Encyclopedia of Entomology|date=Aug 11, 2008|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|location=Gale virtual reference library|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC|isbn=9781402062421}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q21249997}}\n\n[[Category:Callophrys|xami]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHost plants:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callophrys_xami"}

One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy. When pressed, Peter suggests that the game is real. Noticing the time, Simone leaves the diner but is accosted by two men outside.

The two take the fish, which introduces itself as Clara, to [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]]. They follow the clues and eventually are lead up to a roof, where \"Clara\" encourages them to reveal something scary to each other. Peter admits to Simone that he likes her, but Simone is unable to reciprocate, leaving Peter devastated. Simone meets Fredwynn and Janice at the diner, where they discover that each partnership was presented with contradictory information. They are given the choice of going to the Elsewhere Society's protest or the Jejune Institute's shareholders' meeting.

Janice volunteers to demonstrate \"The I.D.E.A\", an invention apparently created by Clara before her disappearance. The device takes Janice back to the day of her wedding, showing her a version of her younger self expressing disdain for Janice's lack of independence. Suddenly, Commander 14 and the Elsewhere Society protesters crash the meeting and scuffle with the audience. Janice leaves with Simone and Peter and find Fredwynn outside the theater, who insists that Jejune and the Elsewhere Society are the same and that the whole game is scripted, though the other three are unconvinced.

The others quickly get irritated by his suspicions and tell him to go home and wait for the next clue. Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

The writing recounts Clara's life in Fishtown and the early days of the Elsewhere Society, originally made up of Clara and three friends. The Society worked to improve Fishtown and make it beautiful, garnering the attention of the Jejune Institute. The next day, Janice finds out Fredwynn hid urgent messages from her husband's nurse. Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion.

One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy.

Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Cave of Kelpies\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480007 |title=Cave of Kelpies |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|6}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = Lee\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480008 |title=Lee |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson & Bianca Ursillo|t=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|13}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |Title = The Creator\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480009 |title=The Creator |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Mark Friedman|t=Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |Title = The Boy\n |RTitle = <ref>{{cite web |url=http://showcase.onthedemo.com/newyorkcity/en/program/17815571/1/EP034155480010 |title=The Boy |website=[[Gracenote]] |accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref>\n |DirectedBy = \n |WrittenBy = Jason Segel\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|27}}\n |Viewers = \n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series has an 83% rating with an average score of 7.15 out of 10 based on 30 reviews.

{"title_page": "Carrickfergus (song)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\"'''Carrickfergus'''\" is an Irish [[folk music|folk song]], named after the town of [[Carrickfergus]] in [[County Antrim]],  [[Northern Ireland]]. Most of the story seems to occur in and around Kilkenny; indeed the \"Ballygran\" referred to in the song may be the local Ballingarry coal mines. \"Marble...black as ink\" is also mined locally.  It was first recorded, under the name \"The Kerry Boatman\", by [[Dominic Behan]] on an LP called ''The Irish Rover'', released in 1965.<ref>\"The Irish Rover\", published by Doug Dobell, no. F-LEUT-2</ref> An almost identical version was recorded afterwards by the Clancy brothers.\n\n==Origins==\nThe origins of the song are unclear, but the melody has been traced to an [[Irish language|Irish-language]] song, \"Do Bh\u00ed Bean Uasal\" (\"There Was a Noblewoman\"), which is attributed to the poet [[Cathal Bu\u00ed Mac Giolla Ghunna]], who died in 1756 in [[County Clare]]. Music collector [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]] obtained two settings of this melody from fellow collector [[Patrick Weston Joyce|Patrick Joyce]]. Joyce came from [[Ballyogan|Ballyorgan]] in the [[Ballyhoura Mountains]], on the borders of counties [[County Limerick|Limerick]] and [[County Cork|Cork]]. Petrie wrote that he believed \"Do Bh\u00ed Bean Uasal\" came from either County Clare or County Limerick, and was in any case a Munster song.<ref name=geo>George Petrie: ''Ancient Music of Ireland'', M. H. Gill, Dublin, 1855 (re-printed 2005, University of Leeds, {{ISBN|978-1-85918-398-4}})</ref>\n\nA version of the song appeared on a ballad sheet in [[Cork (city)|Cork City]] in the mid nineteenth century in [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] form.<ref name=geo/> The Irish lyrics were about a man being [[Cuckold|cuckolded]], a bawdy and humorous ditty. By contrast, the English lyrics are nostalgic.\n\nRobert Gogan<ref>''50 Great Irish Love Songs''. Music Ireland, 2008</ref> suggests Carrickfergus may have evolved from at least two separate songs, which would explain why it does not have a consistent narrative. For example, the ''Ancient Music of Ireland'', published by George Petrie in 1855, contained an Irish-language song called \"An Bhean Uasal\" which featured many but not all of the sentiments used in Carrickfergus. Gogan also refers to a recording of a song called \"Sweet Maggie Gordon\" which is kept in the Music for the Nation section of the US [[Library of Congress]]. It was published by Mrs Pauline Lieder in New York in 1880. It contains verses which are similar to Carrickfergus, but the chorus is closer to another Irish/Scottish folk song called \"Peggy Gordon\".\n\nIn modern times, \"Carrickfergus\" became known after actor [[Peter O'Toole]] related it to Dominic Behan, who put it in print and made a recording in 1965. In his book, \"Ireland Sings\" (London, 1965), Behan gives three verses of which he says, that he obtained two verses from O'Toole and wrote the middle one himself. It is also referenced in the song, \"[[Galway Girl (Ed Sheeran song)|Galway Girl]]\" written and performed by [[Ed Sheeran]] on the album \"Divide\".\n\n==Performances==\nThe song has been recorded by many well known performers. It is a popular request at folk festivals and concerts, and was played at the 1999 funeral of [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] The song was more recently performed by [[Loudon Wainwright III]] over the closing credits of an episode of [[HBO]]'s series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20151226055910/http://www.hbo.com/boardwalk-empire/episodes/01/05-nights-in-ballygran/music.html</ref> Furthermore, the Russian singer-songwriter Aleksandr Karpov (a.k.a. \"Aleksandr O'Karpov\") translated the lyrics into Russian, recording a Russian version of \"Carrickfergus\", also titled {{lang|rus|italic=no|\"\u0417\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043c, \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c\"}} ({{transl|rus|italic=no|Za sinim morem, za okeanom}} - \"Beyond the blue sea, beyond the ocean\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://karpov.hole.ru/songs/karrick.htm|title=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041e'\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0432 {{!}} \u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0438 {{!}} \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0441|website=karpov.hole.ru|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[The Water Is Wide (song)|The Water is Wide]]\" has a similar tune and very similar lyrics in some lines.
