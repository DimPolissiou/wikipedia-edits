Although she did some good things in her time, she was merciless about the unions. I'm not too happy about [[Falklands War|the Falklands]] either. We lost men, we took injuries and [[ARA General Belgrano|we blew up a ship]]. I suppose we need it for a base, but my common sense tells me that it does belong more to Argentina than it does to us. Lots of people may throw things at me for saying that about Thatcher, but hopefully not during the performance. She was a powerful figure, but she did damn all for empowering women. She didn\u2019t surround herself with any women whatsoever or encourage women to come into politics or do anything in particular. She could have been a quite wonderful role model.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/10379911.Honor_Blackman_on_her_life_story__Sean_Connery_and_living_in_Bournemouth
