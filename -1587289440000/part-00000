It aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from July 9, 2005 to February 10, 2007.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=117 }}</ref> It was a loose adaptation of TenNapel's graphic novel, ''[[Gear (Image Comics)|Gear]]'', which in the series is also the name of the cats' [[monster truck]]. The series features music composed by longtime TenNapel collaborator, [[Terry Scott Taylor]]. Catscratch's first DVD appearance was on Nick Picks Vol. 3, which came out on February 7, 2006 (though the DVD contained only \"Bringin' Down the Mouse\").\n\n==Description==\nThe series revolves around a trio of [[anthropomorphic]] feline brothers. After their wealthy owner Edna Cramdilly died, she left her riches to them, along with a menacing, oversized [[monster truck]] named Gear and a dignified [[butler]] named Hovis.  The program commonly chronicles their wealthy lifestyles and action-packed, sometimes paranormal experiences. Other characters include the sweet young neighbor girl, Kimberly, with whom Gordon is obsessed, and the cats' competitive rivals the Chumpy Chump Brothers.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n\n* Mr. Blik (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]): The [[De facto|self-appointed]] [[Bombay cat]] leader of the group who's confident, pampered and vain. He often gets himself into major trouble and is prone to near-death injuries. Mr. Blik is proud of his newly inherited riches and spends his money on anything and everything that spells respect and power. Mr. Blik always insults his two brothers. Mr. Blik's catch phrases are, \"Yeah!\" and \"Suckers!\" He is the oldest of the three.\n* Gordon Quid (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): An outspoken member of the Highland Quid clan and acts like he's from [[Scotland]] despite the fact that he is not. However, he speaks with a thick stereotypical [[Scottish people|Scottish]] accent. He is kind-hearted, has a soft spot for \"Human\" Kimberly and loves to sing, which quite regularly angers his older brother, Mr. Blik. He is also an excellent cook, usually cooking [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish recipes]], which a lot of people don't find edible. He has an orange patch on his right eye. The episode \"Lovesick\" shows he is allergic to both broccoli and chocolate, which cause disastrous effects upon contact. At first, the reaction seems to consist of typical allergic symptoms, such as sneezing, but he eventually into a [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Mr. Hyde]]-like monster, similar to a cat-like monster they were watching in a movie. Gordon's catch phrases are, \"In the name of the Highland Quid Clan\", \"Feel my sting.\", \"Great gopher\", \"Cheer\", and sometimes \"Pop a Wheelie!\". He is the shortest of the three, younger than Mr. Blik and older than Waffle.\n* Waffle (voiced by [[Kevin McDonald]]): An extremely enthusiastic, gullible and childish cat. He has an affinity for [[newt]]s, and can speak their language of Newtuguese as if he were a newt himself. Waffle is a lover of life who is overly optimistic. His catch phrases are \"Spleee!\" or \"Woohoo!\" when he's happy and gets super-excited about all things silly. Waffle has been wowed by revolving doors, fingers, bubble wrap and newts. He also wishes roller coasters were public transportation, would eat donuts straight from \"donut trees\", loves zero gravity basketball and smelling the pictures of flowers on shirts. Waffle also likes doing flatulent sounds with his underarms. He is a gray [[American Curl]] with long, floppy ears and a long tail with dark periwinkle stripes like his right ear. He is the tallest but the youngest of the three.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Hovis (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) Mrs. Cramdilly's butler, who looks after the cats and collects her measly paychecks (which Mr. Blik signs). He's not exactly thrilled about his new situation, but he hails from a long line of butlers who have served in the house and he honestly believes he has nowhere else to go. Therefore, Hovis puts up with the fact that the former pets have become his masters. Blik barks out orders constantly, Gordon treats him as an equal and Waffle hasn't quite figured out that he's not a pet anymore (he still asks Hovis to be let out and scratched behind his ears). His birthday is April 14, 1982, as seen in \"Love Jackal\".\n* Kimberly (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): Kimberly is an 8-year-old girl with a good-natured personality, a gap in her teeth, and an obsession with [[unicorn]]s. She is one of the few human friends the cats have. She doesn't think they are greedy, and just accepts her feline neighbors for who they are and sees the good in their hearts. She is also completely unaware of the fact that Gordon has a complete infatuation with her. She has three human friends named Kaitlin, Kaitlyn and Charlotte.\n* Randall the Bear (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): An antagonistic brown [[Grizzly bear]] who is constantly on the hunt for the three cat brothers. He knows where the cats live, and will sometimes be at their door to eat them up as soon as it is opened.\n\n==Production==\n''Catscratch'' went into production in early 2005. Production continued on ''Catscratch'' until the final episode, \"Spindango Fundulation/Duck and Cover\" aired on February 10, 2007. After the initial run concluded, [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] continued to show re-runs of the cartoon until January 2, 2009. It was briefly shown again on December 19, 2015.\n\n==Episodes==\n'''Note:''' All episodes were directed by Michael Girard, with only two episodes being co-directed by:\n*Doug TenNapel in \"A Line in the Litterbox\"\n*Christine Kolosov-Pitt in \"King of Clubs\"\n{{Episode table|background=C878DA|overall=|title=|writer=|aux3=|aux3T=Storyboard by|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1a\n| Title           = To the Moon\n| WrittenBy       = Peter Hastings\n| Aux3            = Luther McLaurin\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|9}}<ref name=\"tv.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/catscratch/episodes/ |title=Catscratch \u2013 Episode Guide |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Mr. Blik tries to win a barbecue contest by going to the moon for moon rocks after Gordon tells him a story about Duke Eark Splee.\n| LineColor       = C878DA\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1b\n| Title           = Bringin' Down the Mouse\n| WrittenBy       = Peter Hastings\n| Aux3            = Luther McLaurin and Guy Vasilovich\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|9}}\n| ShortSummary    = Mr. Blik won't let Waffle join him and Gordon on the Mouse Hunters' Ball, simply because he never caught a mouse.

The show is a by-the-book program, but that doesn't mean it's not sometimes funny or even touching. Many kids will get a kick out of it, although you may not be as tolerant. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but nothing terribly right, either.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/catscratch | title=Catscratch review | date=9 July  2005 | author=Wenk, Sarah | publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nomination\n!Result\t\n|-\n|2006\n|Annie Best Character Design in an Animated Television Production Luther McLaurin\nCasting Society of America\n|Nominated\n|-\n|2006\n| Nominated Artios Best Animated Voice-Over Television Casting Sarah Noonan Meredith Layne\nMotion Picture Sound Editors\n|Nominated\n|-\n|2006  \n|Golden Reel Award Best Sound Editing in Television Animated\n|Nominated\n|-\n|2008\n|Golden Reel Award Best Sound Editing - SFX, Foley, Dialogue, ADR & Music\n|Nominated\n|-\n|}\n\n==Comics==\nConfirmed by an e-mail from Doug TenNapel, there were a few 2-page ''Catscratch'' comics in the works for [[Nickelodeon Magazine]].

It aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from July 9, 2005 to February 10, 2007.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=117 }}</ref> It was a loose adaptation of TenNapel's graphic novel, ''[[Gear (Image Comics)|Gear]]'', which in the series is also the name of the cats' [[monster truck]]. The series features music composed by longtime TenNapel collaborator, [[Terry Scott Taylor]]. Catscratch's first DVD appearance was on Nick Picks Vol. 3, which came out on February 7, 2006 (though the DVD contained only \"Bringin' Down the Mouse\").\n\n==Description==\nThe series revolves around a trio of [[anthropomorphic]] feline brothers. After their wealthy owner Edna Cramdilly died, she left her riches to them, along with a menacing, oversized [[monster truck]] named Gear and a dignified [[butler]] named Hovis.  The program commonly chronicles their wealthy lifestyles and action-packed, sometimes paranormal experiences. Other characters include the sweet young neighbor girl, Kimberly, with whom Gordon is obsessed, and the cats' competitive rivals the Chumpy Chump Brothers.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n\n* Mr. Blik (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]): The [[De facto|self-appointed]] [[Bombay cat]] leader of the group who's confident, pampered and vain. He often gets himself into major trouble and is prone to near-death injuries. Mr. Blik is proud of his newly inherited riches and spends his money on anything and everything that spells respect and power. Mr. Blik always insults his two brothers. Mr. Blik's catch phrases are, \"Yeah!\" and \"Suckers!\" He is the oldest of the three.\n* Gordon Quid (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): An outspoken member of the Highland Quid clan and acts like he's from [[Scotland]] despite the fact that he is not. However, he speaks with a thick stereotypical [[Scottish people|Scottish]] accent. He is kind-hearted, has a soft spot for \"Human\" Kimberly and loves to sing, which quite regularly angers his older brother, Mr. Blik. He is also an excellent cook, usually cooking [[Scottish cuisine|Scottish recipes]], which a lot of people don't find edible. He has an orange patch on his right eye. The episode \"Lovesick\" shows he is allergic to both broccoli and chocolate, which cause disastrous effects upon contact. At first, the reaction seems to consist of typical allergic symptoms, such as sneezing, but he eventually into a [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Mr. Hyde]]-like monster, similar to a cat-like monster they were watching in a movie. Gordon's catch phrases are, \"In the name of the Highland Quid Clan\", \"Feel my sting.\", \"Great gopher\", \"Cheer\", and sometimes \"Pop a Wheelie!\". He is the shortest of the three, younger than Mr. Blik and older than Waffle.\n* Waffle (voiced by [[Kevin McDonald]]): An extremely enthusiastic, gullible and childish cat. He has an affinity for [[newt]]s, and can speak their language of Newtuguese as if he were a newt himself. Waffle is a lover of life who is overly optimistic. His catch phrases are \"Spleee!\" or \"Woohoo!\" when he's happy and gets super-excited about all things silly. Waffle has been wowed by revolving doors, fingers, bubble wrap and newts. He also wishes roller coasters were public transportation, would eat donuts straight from \"donut trees\", loves zero gravity basketball and smelling the pictures of flowers on shirts. Waffle also likes doing flatulent sounds with his underarms. He is a gray [[American Curl]] with long, floppy ears and a long tail with dark periwinkle stripes like his right ear. He is the tallest but the youngest of the three.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Hovis (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) Mrs. Cramdilly's butler, who looks after the cats and collects her measly paychecks (which Mr. Blik signs). He's not exactly thrilled about his new situation, but he hails from a long line of butlers who have served in the house and he honestly believes he has nowhere else to go. Therefore, Hovis puts up with the fact that the former pets have become his masters. Blik barks out orders constantly, Gordon treats him as an equal and Waffle hasn't quite figured out that he's not a pet anymore (he still asks Hovis to be let out and scratched behind his ears). His birthday is April 14, 1982, as seen in \"Love Jackal\".\n* Kimberly (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]): Kimberly is an 8-year-old girl with a good-natured personality, a gap in her teeth, and an obsession with [[unicorn]]s. She is one of the few human friends the cats have. She doesn't think they are greedy, and just accepts her feline neighbors for who they are and sees the good in their hearts. She is also completely unaware of the fact that Gordon has a complete infatuation with her. She has three human friends named Kaitlin, Kaitlyn and Charlotte.\n* Randall the Bear (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): An antagonistic brown [[Grizzly bear]] who is constantly on the hunt for the three cat brothers. He knows where the cats live, and will sometimes be at their door to eat them up as soon as it is opened.\n\n==Production==\n''Catscratch'' went into production in early 2005. Production continued on ''Catscratch'' until the final episode, \"Spindango Fundulation/Duck and Cover\" aired on February 10, 2007. After the initial run concluded, [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] continued to show re-runs of the cartoon until January 2, 2009. It was briefly shown again on December 19, 2015.\n\n==Episodes==\n'''Note:''' All episodes were directed by Michael Girard, with only two episodes being co-directed by:\n*Doug TenNapel in \"A Line in the Litterbox\"\n*Christine Kolosov-Pitt in \"King of Clubs\"\n{{Episode table|background=C878DA|overall=|title=|writer=|aux3=|aux3T=Storyboard by|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1a\n| Title           = To the Moon\n| WrittenBy       = Peter Hastings\n| Aux3            = Luther McLaurin\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|9}}<ref name=\"tv.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/catscratch/episodes/ |title=Catscratch \u2013 Episode Guide |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Mr. Blik tries to win a barbecue contest by going to the moon for moon rocks after Gordon tells him a story about Duke Eark Splee.\n| LineColor       = C878DA\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1b\n| Title           = Bringin' Down the Mouse\n| WrittenBy       = Peter Hastings\n| Aux3            = Luther McLaurin and Guy Vasilovich\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|9}}\n| ShortSummary    = Mr. Blik won't let Waffle join him and Gordon on the Mouse Hunters' Ball, simply because he never caught a mouse.

The show is a by-the-book program, but that doesn't mean it's not sometimes funny or even touching. Many kids will get a kick out of it, although you may not be as tolerant. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but nothing terribly right, either.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/catscratch | title=Catscratch review | date=9 July  2005 | author=Wenk, Sarah | publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Nomination\n!Result\t\n|-\n|2006\n|Annie Best Character Design in an Animated Television Production Luther McLaurin\nCasting Society of America\n|Nominated\n|-\n|2006\n| Nominated Artios Best Animated Voice-Over Television Casting Sarah Noonan Meredith Layne\nMotion Picture Sound Editors\n|Nominated\n|-\n|2006  \n|Golden Reel Award Best Sound Editing in Television Animated\n|Nominated\n|-\n|2008\n|Golden Reel Award Best Sound Editing - SFX, Foley, Dialogue, ADR & Music\n|Nominated\n|-\n|}\n\n==Comics==\nConfirmed by an e-mail from Doug TenNapel, there were a few 2-page ''Catscratch'' comics in the works for [[Nickelodeon Magazine]].

{"title_page": "Bible translations into Esperanto", "text_new": "The initiator of Esperanto, [[L. L. Zamenhof]], translated the entire [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Esperanto]]. His translation has been much admired by Esperantists and is widely held up as a model or exemplar for other Esperanto authors and translators. Other translators have also edited and published Esperanto versions of the New Testament and Apocrypha.\n<!--[[File:Biblio.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Complete edition of the Bible in Esperanto, jointly edited by Catholic and Protestant Esperantists and published by Kava-Pech in 2006.]] not currently active because it will display the wrong image due to a naming conflict between the English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons; once the conflict is resolved by a file mover, we can remove this comment code and allow the image to display.-->\n\n==Historical development==\n===New Testament===\nA committee led by British clergy and scholars (J.C. Rust, B.J. Beveridge and C.G. Wilkinson) was formed to translate the [[New Testament]] and to review [[L. L. Zamenhof]]'s translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] for eventual publication by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. The New Testament was completed in 1910 and published in 1912. The translation of the New Testament is influenced by the English ''[[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]'', so it closely follows the ''textus receptus'' rather than the more modern accepted text based on the most ancient Greek manuscripts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Old Testament===\nZamenhof translated the entire Masoretic Bible (known to Christians as the [[Old Testament]]) into Esperanto, completing the work in March 1915. However, Zamenhof was prevented from sending the completed manuscript to the Bible committee in Great Britain, informing the committee's president, Esperantist Rev. John Cyprian Rust, of the major obstacle which had arisen. Writing in French, which was permitted by postal censorship rules, Zamenhof wrote: \"Unfortunately I cannot at the present time send you the translation, because our postal service does not forward anything which is written in Esperanto; therefore, I must wait until the end of the war.\" Only after the First World War \u2014 and two years after the death of Zamenhof \u2014 did the translation arrive in Britain.\n\nAccording to Arieh ben Guni, in preparing his Esperanto version, Zamenhof appears to have relied primarily on the 1783 German [[Pentateuch]] translation and commentary by [[Moses Mendelssohn]], \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 (''Sefer Netivot ha-shalom - \u1e7fe-hu \u1e25ibur kolel \u1e25amishah \u1e25umshe torah \u02bbim targum askhenazi u-ve\u02bcur'' \u2014 in which the German was written in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew characters]]; and the [[Russian Synodal Bible]] (''\u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434'')<ref name=\"benGuni\">Arieh ben Guni, \"[http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr55/testamento.html Recenzo: La Esperanta traduko de la Malnova Testamento] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516063806/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr55/testamento.html |date=2010-05-16 }}\" (\"Review: The Esperanto translation of the Old Testament\") in ''La nica literatura revuo'' no. 5, pp. 194-197.

Two [[Quakers]], the sisters [[Priscilla Hannah Peckover]] (1833-1931) and Algerina Peckover (1841-1927) supported the project financially. A translation of the entire Christian canon as recognized by Protestants, often referred to in Esperanto as the ''Londona Biblio'', was published in 1926.

However, Dr. Berveling, a [[Remonstrants|Dutch Free Church]] theologian and classical linguist, has translated most of a new version of the New Testament, eschewing the syntactically overliteral tendencies of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] version, which is perhaps most akin to the English [[Revised Version]] of 1881.\n\nThe Brazilian publisher Fonto has issued Berveling's gospel translations according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in four slim volumes as ''La bona mesa\u011do de Jesuo'' (\"The good message of Jesus\", 1992); the fourth volume includes a concordance to the four gospels. The first volume of his projected New Testament appeared as ''Leteroj de Pa\u016dlo kaj lia skolo'' (\"Letters of Paul and his school\", 2004), which contained the entire [[Pauline epistles|Pauline canon]].

Rust, B.J. Beveridge and C.G. Wilkinson) was formed to translate the [[New Testament]] and to review [[L. L. Zamenhof]]'s translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] for eventual publication by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. The New Testament was completed in 1910 and published in 1912. The translation of the New Testament is influenced by the English ''[[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]'', so it closely follows the ''textus receptus'' rather than the more modern accepted text based on the most ancient Greek manuscripts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Old Testament===\nZamenhof translated the entire Masoretic Bible (known to Christians as the [[Old Testament]]) into Esperanto, completing the work in March 1915. However, Zamenhof was prevented from sending the completed manuscript to the Bible committee in Great Britain, informing the committee's president, Esperantist Rev. John Cyprian Rust, of the major obstacle which had arisen. Writing in French, which was permitted by postal censorship rules, Zamenhof wrote: \"Unfortunately I cannot at the present time send you the translation, because our postal service does not forward anything which is written in Esperanto; therefore, I must wait until the end of the war.\" Only after the First World War -- and two years after the death of Zamenhof -- did the translation arrive in Britain.\n\nAccording to Arieh ben Guni, in preparing his Esperanto version, Zamenhof appears to have relied primarily on the 1783 German [[Pentateuch]] translation and commentary by [[Moses Mendelssohn]], \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05dd \u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 (''Sefer Netivot ha-shalom - \u1e7fe-hu \u1e25ibur kolel \u1e25amishah \u1e25umshe torah \u02bbim targum askhenazi u-ve\u02bcur'' -- in which the German was written in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew characters]]; and the [[Russian Synodal Bible]] (''\u0421\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434'')<ref name=\"benGuni\">Arieh ben Guni, \"[http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr55/testamento.html Recenzo: La Esperanta traduko de la Malnova Testamento] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516063806/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr55/testamento.html |date=2010-05-16 }}\" (\"Review: The Esperanto translation of the Old Testament\") in ''La nica literatura revuo'' no. 5, pp. 194-197.

Two [[Quakers]], the sisters [[Priscilla Hannah Peckover]] (1833-1931) and Algerina Peckover (1841-1927) supported the project financially. A translation of the entire Christian canon as recognized by Protestants, often referred to in Esperanto as the ''Londona Biblio'', was published in 1926.
