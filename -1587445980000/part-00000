After securing a drummer and bassist the band proceeded to write an eight-song demo which came out in early 2002. After a few short tours down the west coast Blue Monday entered the studio again in mid-2002 and recorded the ''War Wounds'' 7\" EP which came out in early 2003 on the now defunct For The Core Records from California.\n\nIn early 2003, the original bassist and drummer left the band.  With these departures Adam Mitchell and Jason Kehoe joined on bass and drums respectively. Adam's brother Dave joined at the end of 2003.  In 2003, Blue Monday released their second EP,'' What's Done Is Done'' on Stab And Kill Records from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Blue Monday spent the bulk of 2003 and 2004 touring throughout the US. They toured with fellow hardcore bands such as Mental, Desperate Measures, Far From Breaking, Lights Out, Final Word, Internal Affairs, The Distance, and Allegiance during this time.\n\n''What's Done Is Done'' and the subsequent touring brought Blue Monday to the attention of seminal modern hardcore label Bridge Nine Records who signed them after playing the now defunct Summer Hardcore Festival Posi-Numbers in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]].  In December, Blue Monday entered Atomic Studios in Brooklyn, New York and recorded their debut album for Bridge Nine engineered Dean Baltulonis. With the release of ''Rewritten'' in the spring of 2005 Blue Monday toured with label mates Champion, Terror and completed a full US tour with fellow Vancouver band Go It Alone and Allegiance from the bay area.  In October 2005, Blue Monday co-headlined a tour in Europe with friends Go It Alone.\n\n==Former members==\n* Dave Mac \u2014 [[Singing|vocals]]\n* Kyle De Ville \u2014 [[guitar]]\n* Dave Mitchell \u2014 guitar\n* Jason Kehoe \u2014 [[drum kit|drums]]\n* Adam Mitchell \u2014 [[Bass guitar|bass]]\n* Tony Patrick -

Gender bending can also be achieved through [[cross-dressing]] and [[androgyny]], both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of [[biological]] or [[physiological]] sex. Thus, gender bending protests gender [[essentialism]]. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well \u2013 for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Gender bending is based in [[gender performativity]]: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are \"masculine\" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are \"feminine\" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this \"dress code\" and the opportunity for a resistance: \"The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkes |first1=Gail L. |title=Dressing\u2010up \u2014 cross\u2010dressing and sexual dissonance |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=1995 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=261\u2013270 |doi=10.1080/09589236.1995.9960612}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-dressing and androgyny===\nCross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to \"fuck with gender\" roles and presentation. [[Androgyny]] is not specifically gender bending, but it can be considered as such if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The origin of the word \"[[androgynous]]\" is from the Greek ''androgynos'': \"male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: androgynous|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> Androgyny, as a form of gender expression. may present as a blended unification of masculine and feminine traits, with the goal of making one's sex indiscernible, or as a dichotomous mix juxtaposing male and female phenotypes, with the goal of transgressing gender norms. <ref name=\"Stitt\">{{Cite book|title=ACT For Gender Identity: The Comprehensive Guide |last=Stitt|first=Alex|pages =42-43|date=2020|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1785927997|location=London|oclc=1089850112}}</ref>\n\nThere have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. [[Eddie Izzard]] started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.\n\n[[Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1900|loc=55}}</ref> and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in [[Antony and Cleopatra]], Portia in [[The Merchant of Venice]], Rosalind in [[As You Like It]], Viola in [[Twelfth Night]].\n\nGender bending is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].\n\n===Drag===\n[[Drag (clothing)|Drag shows]] are stage performances where people perform in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" gender stereotypes of the person's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves [[drag king]]s or [[drag queen]]s. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or [[lip sync]].\n\nA faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a [[faux queen]] or the other way around for a faux king.\n\n\"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rupp |first=Leila |author2=Taylor, Verta |author3=Shapiro, Eve |title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings: The Difference Gender Makes |journal=Sexualities |date=June 8, 2010 |volume=13 |issue=275 |pages=278 |doi=10.1177/1363460709352725 }}<!--|accessdate=June 4, 2012--></ref>\n\n===Literature===\nLiterature, in particular [[erotica]], is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to [[Carol Queen]]'s short story ''The Leather Daddy and the Femme'', where a lesbian [[butch and femme|femme]] uses a [[strap-on dildo]] to have sex with a gay leather [[daddy (gay slang)|daddy]] as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leibetseder|first=Doris|title=Queer Tracks: Subversive Strategies in Rock and Pop Music|year=2013|publisher=Ash gate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1409472032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1cxkUZNMKwC}}</ref>\n\n==Non-political gender bending==\nGender bending is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is [[gender performance|performed]]; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the [[gender binary]] roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally [[political radicalism]].<ref name=Butler /> Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: <blockquote>\nGender-fuck is not intrinsically radical \u2013 otherwise gender-benders such as [[Boy George]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[David Bowie]] etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck \u2013 such as that of [[RuPaul]] or (to a limited extent) [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] \u2013 gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender ''as an axis of power'' that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=Tamsin|title=Lesbian Studies: Setting an Agenda|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415086566|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt/page/109 109]|url=https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt|url-access=registration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Judith Butler and gender as performance==\n[[Judith Butler]] is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of \"[[gender performativity]]\" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, there is a gender binary along with strict social repercussions against those that act against the \"normal\" script. This script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of these are ways to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.<ref name=Butler>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nJudith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.<ref name=Butler />\n\n==Gender and childraising==\nAccording to Susan Witt's 1997 study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more [[androgynous]] gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witt|first=Susan D.|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|publisher=University of Akron School of Home Economics and Family Ecology|accessdate=26 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520230643/http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|archive-date=20 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits [[gender performance]]s that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson and Cristyn Davies report that a parental figure may respond with hostility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Kerry|first2=Cristyn |last2=Davies|title=Tomboys and Sissy Girls: young girls' negotiations of femininity and masculinity |url=https://uws.academia.edu/KerryRobinson/Papers/319023/Tomboys_and_Sissy_Girls_young_girls_negotiations_of_femininity_and_masculinity |journal=International Journal of Equity and Innovation in Early Childhood|volume=5|issue=7|pages=17\u201331|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> According  to Roberts et al. in ''Pediatrics'', people who do not conform to the [[gender binary]] are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community.

Within this cultural expectation, people designated as male are expected to be masculine, while those designated female are expected to be feminine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender Trouble: Tenth Anniversary Edition|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415389550|location=New York, NY|pages=10\u201311|quote=}}</ref> The belief in and subscription to polar gender roles is known as gender binarism.\n\nIn many cultures, for a person to be seen as belonging to a particular gender category, the individual must not only have a particular anatomical (including genital) makeup, but must conform to that culture's ideas of appropriate sex-role stereotypes.

Gender bending can also be achieved through [[cross-dressing]] and [[androgyny]], both of which challenge and contribute to dismantling the gender binary by separating expression or performance of gender from perceptions of [[biological]] or [[physiological]] sex. Thus, gender bending protests gender [[essentialism]]. This concept is protested not only through non-normative appearance, but by challenging normative gender roles, characteristics, or behaviors as well \u2013 for example, a female-bodied individual who is purposefully assertive and nondomestic in order to challenge the notion of essential femininity. Gender bending is based in [[gender performativity]]: the concept of gender as a performance. It can be achieved through physical presentation (e.g. clothing, hair, makeup, and secondary sex characteristics), as well as behavior. Because much of gender performance is expressed through clothing, in societies where a gender binary can be observed, there is an established, widespread notion that some clothes are \"masculine\" and should be worn only by male-bodied individuals, and others are \"feminine\" and should be worn only by female-bodied individuals. Hawkes, sociologist and author, addresses this \"dress code\" and the opportunity for a resistance: \"The universality of [dress] codes and their meanings allows for the [subversion of] the mainstream 'messages' they convey and through this to illuminate the existence of alternative [gender] identities.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkes |first1=Gail L. |title=Dressing\u2010up \u2014 cross\u2010dressing and sexual dissonance |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=1995 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=261\u2013270 |doi=10.1080/09589236.1995.9960612}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-dressing and androgyny===\nCross-dressing would be a form of gender bending because the purpose is to \"fuck with gender\" roles and presentation. [[Androgyny]] is not specifically gender bending, but it can be considered as such if someone is being androgynous on purpose. Many people who are androgynous may not make a conscious effort to look so.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The origin of the word \"[[androgynous]]\" is from the Greek ''androgynos'': \"male and female in one; womanish man; common to men and women\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: androgynous|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> Androgyny, as a form of gender expression. may present as a blended unification of masculine and feminine traits, with the goal of making one's sex indiscernible, or as a dichotomous mix juxtaposing male and female phenotypes, with the goal of transgressing gender norms. <ref name=\"Stitt\">{{Cite book|title=ACT For Gender Identity: The Comprehensive Guide |last=Stitt|first=Alex|pages =42-43|date=2020|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1785927997|location=London|oclc=1089850112}}</ref>\n\nThere have been many famous people who have cross-dressed and many famous people now who are androgynous. The rock star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was very well known for his cross-dressing or androgynous look. [[Eddie Izzard]] started to freely talk about his cross-dressing as early as 1992.\n\n[[Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing in his performances. Over the centuries some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1900|loc=55}}</ref> and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. With this said, Shakespeare had characters in his writings that were considered cross-dressers. The four of the five main female characters in his plays were seen as women who cross-dress as men or boys: Cleopatra in [[Antony and Cleopatra]], Portia in [[The Merchant of Venice]], Rosalind in [[As You Like It]], Viola in [[Twelfth Night]].\n\nGender bending is seen through many forms of life. One of these forms is [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].\n\n===Drag===\n[[Drag (clothing)|Drag shows]] are stage performances where people perform in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. Drag costuming and makeup may in some cases simply involve an actor portraying a character of a sex or gender different from their own, or the performance itself may be a parody or critique of gender and gender roles. Often \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" gender stereotypes of the person's culture are exaggerated for comic or satirical effect. Performers may call themselves [[drag king]]s or [[drag queen]]s. Drag revues typically involve elaborate, glamorous costumes and musical performances. The entertainers may sing, dance, or [[lip sync]].\n\nA faux drag performer is a person who performs as the gender they identify as in day-to-day life, albeit in a usually exaggerated form. For instance a cisgender woman who performs as a drag queen is a [[faux queen]] or the other way around for a faux king.\n\n\"In order to understand the differences and similarities between gay male drag queens and female-bodied and transgender drag kings and bio queens, we consider how the personal gender and sexual identities of drag performers affect and are affected by their gender performances in drag.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rupp |first=Leila |author2=Taylor, Verta |author3=Shapiro, Eve |title=Drag Queens and Drag Kings: The Difference Gender Makes |journal=Sexualities |date=June 8, 2010 |volume=13 |issue=275 |pages=278 |doi=10.1177/1363460709352725 }}<!--|accessdate=June 4, 2012--></ref>\n\n===Literature===\nLiterature, in particular [[erotica]], is another method that has been used to explore genderfuck scenarios. The basis of the literary genre of genderfuck is that it's unimportant whether someone is a man or a woman during the sex act. Doris Libetseder points to [[Carol Queen]]'s short story ''The Leather Daddy and the Femme'', where a lesbian [[butch and femme|femme]] uses a [[strap-on dildo]] to have sex with a gay leather [[daddy (gay slang)|daddy]] as a fitting example of the genderfuck genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leibetseder|first=Doris|title=Queer Tracks: Subversive Strategies in Rock and Pop Music|year=2013|publisher=Ash gate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1409472032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1cxkUZNMKwC}}</ref>\n\n==Non-political gender bending==\nGender bending is not always a purposeful political standpoint. According to Butler, gender is something that is [[gender performance|performed]]; it only holds cultural significance to the extent that this is ascribed to it. Despite the [[gender binary]] roles society imposes, there are many ways for individuals to express gender variation and not all of them are intentionally [[political radicalism]].<ref name=Butler /> Further, in 1995 Tamsin Wilton argued that: <blockquote>\nGender-fuck is not intrinsically radical \u2013 otherwise gender-benders such as [[Boy George]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[David Bowie]] etc. would not get away with it to the extent that they do. A politically aware gender-fuck \u2013 such as that of [[RuPaul]] or (to a limited extent) [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] \u2013 gets much closer to radicalism, but it is only by incorporating a critique of gender ''as an axis of power'' that playing about with gender signifiers can be more than wickedly entertaining<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=Tamsin|title=Lesbian Studies: Setting an Agenda|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415086566|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt/page/109 109]|url=https://archive.org/details/lesbianstudiesse00wilt|url-access=registration}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Judith Butler and gender as performance==\n[[Judith Butler]] is one of the most well-known theorists who believe the idea that gender is something that is performed by individuals. Her concept of \"[[gender performativity]]\" is the idea that people choose to perform gender in a context in which we are given very few socially acceptable choices, but can be explained as being similar to what actors do in front of the camera. Due to the importance we place on the belief that men need to act like men and women need to behave like women, it is often believed that gender is an innate attribute and not a social construct. In her article ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', Butler explains that if gender is something that sexed bodies assimilate to in order to follow the societal codes of what is appropriate behavior, then those actions can be conceptualized in different ways to allow more flexibility for individuals. In the same article, she asserts that in U.S. culture, there is a gender binary along with strict social repercussions against those that act against the \"normal\" script. This script is policed by harassment, parental pressures to fill expectations, and peer influence. All of these are ways to guarantee that the culture will repeat itself from generation to generation.<ref name=Butler>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nJudith Butler's theory about gender roles and their social implications and need for reconstruction is more fully developed in her book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990). She argues that the limited acceptance of variation in gender roles does great harm to individual expression. With the limited options for both men and women, there is little room for their combined forces, because men are constantly focused on becoming the financial supporters of their families which leaves women with the sole option of being the maternal expert she is expected to be. This idea excludes the masculine women or feminine men from being acceptable parental figures for their children because it may lead to a child growing up and conceptualizing the world differently.<ref name=Butler />\n\n==Gender and childraising==\nAccording to Susan Witt's 1997 study, children generally come to their first conclusions about being male or female from their parents since typically they are the first people the child relates to and the nature of the relationship is intense. Besides parents giving children gender specific clothing, toys, and expectations, there are often many subtle messages about what is acceptable or not regarding gender. Witt's study showed that children that grow up with more [[androgynous]] gendered parents are more focused on achievements and typically have a better sense of self.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witt|first=Susan D.|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|publisher=University of Akron School of Home Economics and Family Ecology|accessdate=26 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520230643/http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm|archive-date=20 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Conversely, in cases of gender nonconformity, when a child exhibits [[gender performance]]s that are atypical of their prescribed gender role, Kerry Robinson and Cristyn Davies report that a parental figure may respond with hostility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Kerry|first2=Cristyn |last2=Davies|title=Tomboys and Sissy Girls: young girls' negotiations of femininity and masculinity |url=https://uws.academia.edu/KerryRobinson/Papers/319023/Tomboys_and_Sissy_Girls_young_girls_negotiations_of_femininity_and_masculinity |journal=International Journal of Equity and Innovation in Early Childhood|volume=5|issue=7|pages=17\u201331|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> According  to Roberts et al. in ''Pediatrics'', people who do not conform to the [[gender binary]] are often subject to abuse from society, from within the family and within their community.

By recognizing the power of laughter, Juana appropriated the purpose of humor, and used it as a socially acceptable medium with which to question notions of men and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Julie Greer|title=Humor in Spain's American Colonies: The Case of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz|journal=Studies in American Humor|date=2000|volume=7|pages=35\u201347|publisher=Studies in American Humor, 2000|language=English}}</ref>\n\n'''''Pawns of a House'''''\n\nThe work was first performed on [[October 4]], 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes\u2019 first son\u2019s birth.<ref name=\":3\">Garc\u00eda Vald\u00e9s, p\u00e1g. 45-50.</ref>  Some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop [[Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas]]\u2019 entrance to the capital, but this theory is not considered reliable.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together.

The latter represents an important aspect because, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.\nIn the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Pamela |title=De la m\u00fasica un cuaderno ped\u00eds': Musical Notation in Sor Juana's Works. |journal=Bulletin of Hispanic Studies |date=December 2006 |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=497\u2013507|doi=10.3828/bhs.83.6.4 }}</ref>\n\nPropiedad es de natura<br>\nque entre Dios y el hombre media,<br>\ny del cielo el be cuadrado<br>\njunto al be bemol de la tierra.<br>\n(Villancico 220)\n\nOn the other, Sarah Finley<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finley |first1=Sarah |title=Embodied Sound and Female Voice in Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz's Canon: romance 8 and El divino Narciso |journal=Revista de Estudios Hisp\u00e1nicos |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=191\u2013216 |doi=10.1353/rvs.2016.0007}}</ref> offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana.

In the 1989 book, ''Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith'' (translated from Spanish to English by [[Margaret Sayers Peden]]), Paz examines and contemplates Sor Juana\u2019s poetry and life in the context of the history of [[New Spain]], particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Primarily, Paz aims to explain why Sor Juana chose to become a nun.<ref name=\":7\" /> In Juana Ram\u00edrez, Octavio Paz and Diane Marting find that Sor Juana\u2019s decision to become a nun stemmed from her refusal to marry; joining the convent, according to Paz and Marting, was a way for Juana to obtain authority and freedom without marrying.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn his analyses of Sor Juana's poetry, Octavio Paz traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar of her era, [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Paz interprets Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, \"First Dream\" (\"Primero Sue\u00f1o\") as a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of [[Hermeticism|hermetic symbols]], albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Alicia Gaspar de Alba ====\n[[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]]'s historical novel, ''Sor Juana's Second Dream'' (1999), rejects Paz's view that Sor Juana was ambivalent to sexuality, which he portrays as an explanation of her entering the convent.<ref name=\":13\" /> Instead, Gaspar de Alba interprets Sor Juana as [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]]. It was Sor Juana's attraction to other women, which was repressed by the patriarchal and heteronormative society outside of the convent, that led her to become a nun.<ref name=\":13\" /> She criticizes Paz for his portrayal of what she calls Sorjuanistas, whom she claims stem from a Mexican, rather than Indigenous viewpoint, and are homophobic.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThis work won the Latino Literary Hall of Fame Award for Best Historical Novel in 2000. In 2001, it was translated into Spanish and published as ''El Segundo Sue\u00f1o'' by Grijalbo Mondadori. The novel has also been adapted to a stage play, ''The Nun and the Countess'' by Odalys Nanin; and to a film, ''Juana de Asbaje'', directed by Mexican filmmaker Rene Bueno, with the screenplay co-written by Bueno and Gaspar de Alba and Mexican actress [[Ana de la Reguera]] as the title role. ''Juana,'' an opera based on the novel will be performed by Opera UCLA in November 2019, the music composed by [[Carla Lucero]] and the libretto co-written by Lucero and Gaspar de Alba.\n\n==== Luis Felipe Fabre ====\nLuis Felipe Fabre, a Mexican writer and scholar, ridicules other scholars, whom he collectively calls Sorjuanistas, who idolize Sor Juana.<ref name=\":17\" /> In his book, ''Sor Juana and Other Monsters'', Fabre argues that the appropriation and recontextualization imminent in scholars' interpretations of Sor Juana construct Sor Juana as either a heretic or a lesbian.<ref name=\":17\" /> Fabre suggests that such representations constitute Sor Juana as a monstrosity or abnormality rather than as a complex woman.<ref name=\":17\" /> He suggests that rather than locating Sor Juana in a fixed identity, scholarship on Sor Juana should be a fluctuating and multilayered conversation.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n===== Margaret Sayers Peden =====\nMargaret Sayers Peden's 1982 ''A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz'', was the first English translation of Sor Juana's work.<ref>{{Cite book|id={{ASIN|0915998157|country=ca}}}}</ref> As well, Peden is credited for her 1989 translation of ''Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith''. Unlike other translations, Peden chose to translate the title of Sor Juana\u2019s best known work, ''First Dream'', as First I dream instead.

She also argues that Sor Juana's historic focus on gender and class equality in education (the [[public sphere]]) and the household (the [[private sphere]]), in addition to her advocacy for language rights, and the connection between indigenous religious traditions and ecological protection were paramount in the seventeenth century.

A medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Juana was also found. Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo, the sister of President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] (1976-1982), kept the medallion. During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for safekeeping. She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' a month later.

He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana.  Some [[Literary criticism|literary critics]], such as [[Octavio Paz]],<ref>Paz, Octavio. \u00ab\u00bfAzar o justicia\u00bb, ''La segunda Celestina'', ed. Guillermo Schmidhuber.

Julie Greer Johnson describes how Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. She argues that Juana recognized the negative view of women in comedy which was designed to uphold male superiority at the expense of women. By recognizing the power of laughter, Juana appropriated the purpose of humor, and used it as a socially acceptable medium with which to question notions of men and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Julie Greer|title=Humor in Spain's American Colonies: The Case of Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz|journal=Studies in American Humor|date=2000|volume=7|pages=35\u201347|publisher=Studies in American Humor, 2000|language=English}}</ref>\n\n'''''Pawns of a House'''''\n\nThe work was first performed on [[October 4]], 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes\u2019 first son\u2019s birth.<ref name=\":3\">Garc\u00eda Vald\u00e9s, p\u00e1g. 45-50.</ref>  Some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop [[Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas]]\u2019 entrance to the capital, but this theory is not considered reliable.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This [[comedy]] of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late [[New Spanish Baroque|baroque Spanish-American]] literature.  One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Los empe\u00f1os de una casa|last=de la Cruz|first=Sor Juana In\u00e9s|publisher=Impr\u00e9nta Cl\u00e1sica|year=1921|isbn=9781931010177|location=Madrid, Espa\u00f1a|pages=}}</ref> The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the [[archetype]] perfectly.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIt is often considered the peak of Sor Juana\u2019s work and even the peak of all [[Mexican literature|New-Hispanic literature]].

However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.<ref name=\":4\">Ch\u00e1vez, p\u00e1g. 140-142.</ref>\n\nThe plot takes on the well-known theme in [[Greek mythology]] of [[Theseus]]: a hero from [[Crete]] Island.

Theseus\u2019 triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nBesides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect because, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.\nIn the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Pamela |title=De la m\u00fasica un cuaderno ped\u00eds': Musical Notation in Sor Juana's Works. |journal=Bulletin of Hispanic Studies |date=December 2006 |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=497\u2013507|doi=10.3828/bhs.83.6.4 }}</ref>\n\nPropiedad es de natura<br>\nque entre Dios y el hombre media,<br>\ny del cielo el be cuadrado<br>\njunto al be bemol de la tierra.<br>\n(Villancico 220)\n\nOn the other, Sarah Finley<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finley |first1=Sarah |title=Embodied Sound and Female Voice in Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz's Canon: romance 8 and El divino Narciso |journal=Revista de Estudios Hisp\u00e1nicos |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=191\u2013216 |doi=10.1353/rvs.2016.0007}}</ref> offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.\n\n===Other notable works===\n\nOne musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive of [[Metropolital Cathedral of Guatemala|Guatemala Cathedral]].

In the 1989 book, ''Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith'' (translated from Spanish to English by [[Margaret Sayers Peden]]), Paz examines and contemplates Sor Juana\u2019s poetry and life in the context of the history of [[New Spain]], particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Primarily, Paz aims to explain why Sor Juana chose to become a nun.<ref name=\":7\" /> In Juana Ram\u00edrez, Octavio Paz and Diane Marting find that Sor Juana\u2019s decision to become a nun stemmed from her refusal to marry; joining the convent, according to Paz and Marting, was a way for Juana to obtain authority and freedom without marrying.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn his analyses of Sor Juana's poetry, Octavio Paz traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar of her era, [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Paz interprets Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, \"First Dream\" (\"Primero Sue\u00f1o\") as a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of [[Hermeticism|hermetic symbols]], albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Alicia Gaspar de Alba ====\n[[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]]'s historical novel, ''Sor Juana's Second Dream'' (1999), rejects Paz's view that Sor Juana was ambivalent to sexuality, which he portrays as an explanation of her entering the convent.<ref name=\":13\" /> Instead, Gaspar de Alba interprets Sor Juana as [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]]. It was Sor Juana's attraction to other women, which was repressed by the patriarchal and heteronormative society outside of the convent, that led her to become a nun.<ref name=\":13\" /> She criticizes Paz for his portrayal of what she calls Sorjuanistas, whom she claims stem from a Mexican, rather than Indigenous viewpoint, and are homophobic.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThis work won the Latino Literary Hall of Fame Award for Best Historical Novel in 2000. In 2001, it was translated into Spanish and published as ''El Segundo Sue\u00f1o'' by Grijalbo Mondadori. The novel has also been adapted to a stage play, ''The Nun and the Countess'' by Odalys Nanin; and to a film, ''Juana de Asbaje'', directed by Mexican filmmaker Rene Bueno, with the screenplay co-written by Bueno and Gaspar de Alba and Mexican actress [[Ana de la Reguera]] as the title role. ''Juana,'' an opera based on the novel will be performed by Opera UCLA in November 2019, the music composed by [[Carla Lucero]] and the libretto co-written by Lucero and Gaspar de Alba.\n\n==== Luis Felipe Fabre ====\nLuis Felipe Fabre, a Mexican writer and scholar, ridicules other scholars, whom he collectively calls Sorjuanistas, who idolize Sor Juana.<ref name=\":17\" /> In his book, ''Sor Juana and Other Monsters'', Fabre argues that the appropriation and recontextualization imminent in scholars' interpretations of Sor Juana construct Sor Juana as either a heretic or a lesbian.<ref name=\":17\" /> Fabre suggests that such representations constitute Sor Juana as a monstrosity or abnormality rather than as a complex woman.<ref name=\":17\" /> He suggests that rather than locating Sor Juana in a fixed identity, scholarship on Sor Juana should be a fluctuating and multilayered conversation.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n===== Margaret Sayers Peden =====\nMargaret Sayers Peden's 1982 ''A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz'', was the first English translation of Sor Juana's work.<ref>{{Cite book|id={{ASIN|0915998157|country=ca}}}}</ref> As well, Peden is credited for her 1989 translation of ''Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith''.

However, while Paz establishes Sor Juana's historical relevance, Yugar expands on his work to establish Sor Juana's importance in the twenty-first century.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\nYugar argues that Sor Juana is the first female bibliophile in the New World. She also argues that Sor Juana's historic focus on gender and class equality in education (the [[public sphere]]) and the household (the [[private sphere]]), in addition to her advocacy for language rights, and the connection between indigenous religious traditions and ecological protection were paramount in the seventeenth century. Today's similar advocacy ignores her primal position in that work which is currently exclusively associated with [[ecofeminism]] and [[feminist theology]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Historical influence ==\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Statue of Sor Juana In\u00e9s in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n[[File:Fama y obras p\u00f3stumas del F\u00e9nix de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The first part of Sor Juana's complete works, Madrid, 1689.]]\nThe Sor Juana In\u00e9s Services for Abused Women<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.corasupport.org/about/our-story/|title=Our Story|website=CORA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> was established in 1993 to pay Sor Juana's dedication to helping women survivors of domestic violence forward.

A medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Juana was also found. Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo, the sister of President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] (1976-1982), kept the medallion. During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita L\u00f3pez Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for safekeeping. She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' a month later.

This authoritative stance not only demonstrates a direct counter to misogyny, but was also typically reserved for men.<ref name=\":14\" /> As well, Sor Juana's argument that ideas about women in religious hierarchies are culturally constructed, not divine, echoes ideas about the construction of gender and sex.<ref name=\":14\" /> \n\n==== Modern feminist movements ====\nYugar connects Sor Juana to [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist advocacy]] movements in the twenty-first century, such as [[religious feminism]], [[ecofeminism]], and the [[feminist movement]] in general. \n\nAlthough the current religious feminist movement grew out of the [[Liberation theology|Liberation Theology]] movement of the 1970s,<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-exponent.com/latina-feminist-theology-with-theresa-a-yugar/|title=Latina Feminist Theology with Theresa A.

These ideas, Yugar points out, are commonly associated with modern [[Feminism|feminist]] movements concerned with [[decolonization]]<ref name=\":11\" /> and the protection of the planet.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAlicia Gaspar de Alba connects Sor Juana to the modern [[lesbian movement]] and [[Chicano Movement|Chicana movement.]] She links Sor Juana to the concepts of [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and the lesbian continuum, both of which are credited to well-known feminist writer and advocate [[Adrienne Rich]].<ref name=\":13\" /> As well, Gaspar de Alba locates Sor Juana in the Chicana movement, which has not been accepting of Indigenous lesbians.<ref name=\":13\" /> \n\n=== A symbol ===\n\n==== Colonial and indigenous identities ====\nAs a woman in religion, Sor Juana has become associated with the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]], a religious symbol of Mexican identity, but was also connected to Aztec goddesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hind|first=Emily|date=2006|title=Being Jean Franco: Mastering Reading and \"Plotting Women\"|journal=Letras Femeninas|volume=32|issue=1|pages=329\u2013350|issn=0277-4356|jstor=23024128}}</ref> For example, parts of Sor Juana's ''Villancico 224'' are written in Nahuatl, while others are written in Spanish.<ref name=\":16\" /> The Virgin of Guadalupe is the subject of the ''Villancico'', but depending on the language, the poem refers to both the Virgin of Guadalupe and [[Cihuac\u014d\u0101tl|Cihuacoatl]], an Indigneous goddess.<ref name=\":16\" /> It is ambiguous whether Sor Juana prioritizes the Mexican or indigenous religious figure, or whether her focus is on harmonizing the two.<ref name=\":16\" /> \n\nSor Juana's connection to indigenous religious figures is also prominent in her ''[[Loa to Divine Narcissus]]'', (Spanish \"''El Divino Narciso''\") (see Jauregui [https://www.academia.edu/6991029/_El_plato_m\u00e1s_sabroso_eucarist%C3%ADa_plagio_diab\u00f3lico_y_la_traducci\u00f3n_criolla_del_can%C3%ADbal 2003], [https://www.academia.edu/11767784/_Cannibalism_the_Eucharist_and_Criollo_Subjects_ 2009]).

Paz's accredited scholarship on Sor Juana elevated her to a national symbol as a Mexican woman, writer, and religious authority.<ref name=\":13\" /> On the contrary, Gaspar de Alba emphasized Sor Juana's indigenous identity by inserting her into Chicana discourses.<ref name=\":13\" /> \n\n==== Connection to Frida Kahlo ====\nPaul Allatson emphasizes that women like Sor Juana and Frida Kahlo masculinized their appearances to symbolically complicate the space marked for women in society.<ref name=\":13\" /> Sor Juana's decision to cut her hair as punishment for mistakes she made during learning<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msmagazine.com/2011/03/16/my-favorite-feminist-sor-juana-ines-de-la-cruz/|title=My Favorite Feminist: Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz \u2013 Ms. Magazine|website=msmagazine.com|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref> signified her own autonomy, but was also a way to engage in the masculinity expected of male-dominated spaces, like universities.

One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy. When pressed, Peter suggests that the game is real. Noticing the time, Simone leaves the diner but is accosted by two men outside.

Peter admits to Simone that he likes her, but Simone is unable to reciprocate, leaving Peter devastated.

Janice volunteers to demonstrate \"The I.D.E.A\", an invention apparently created by Clara before her disappearance. The device takes Janice back to the day of her wedding, showing her a version of her younger self expressing disdain for Janice's lack of independence. Suddenly, Commander 14 and the Elsewhere Society protesters crash the meeting and scuffle with the audience. Janice leaves with Simone and Peter and find Fredwynn outside the theater, who insists that Jejune and the Elsewhere Society are the same and that the whole game is scripted, though the other three are unconvinced.

The others quickly get irritated by his suspicions and tell him to go home and wait for the next clue. Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion. Back at the house, the group resumes the story of Clara as she's being recruited by Octavio, who promised her vast resources and the power to change the world.

Peter realizes his former employer's parent company is involved in the game. He and Fredwynn infiltrate his old office and identify an IP address through a playlist containing the songs they've heard on their missions. Meanwhile, Janice and Simone find an apartment with one of Clara's paintings and discover her full name on a lease from 1999, Clara Torres. Through newspaper records, they trace Clara's steps back to a former psychiatric hospital Janice had been admitted to in her past, now an apartment complex. Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator.

Commander 14 shows his real face, identical in appearance to Octavio, and they give everyone a new task: to work together. The group watches a video montage of their sleuthing from earlier that day, and realize that it was still just part of the game. Clara, Octavio, and Commander 14 reveal themselves as actors, devastating Peter. All the participants head over to the game's afterparty. Fredwynn searches for the architect of the game, while Simone and Peter agree to start a relationship. Feeling left out, Janice leaves the party and recognizes a woman as the architect.

After telling Janice the truth, Lee gives her the address of the mausoleum where Clara Torres's urn is kept. There, the four discover a cassette tape in which Clara describes her dream of creating art that changes people's view of the world, the message which first inspired Lee to create the game.  Peter and Simone attempt a first date, but Simone refuses to continue a romantic relationship, insistent that Peter's na\u00efvet\u00e9 would make it impossible for them in the real world. Meanwhile, Janice finds out Lev suffered a second stroke. Fredwynn stays with her at the hospital as she decides to take him off life support.

One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy. When pressed, Peter suggests that the game is real. Noticing the time, Simone leaves the diner but is accosted by two men outside.

The device takes Janice back to the day of her wedding, showing her a version of her younger self expressing disdain for Janice's lack of independence. Suddenly, Commander 14 and the Elsewhere Society protesters crash the meeting and scuffle with the audience. Janice leaves with Simone and Peter and find Fredwynn outside the theater, who insists that Jejune and the Elsewhere Society are the same and that the whole game is scripted, though the other three are unconvinced.

The others quickly get irritated by his suspicions and tell him to go home and wait for the next clue. Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion. Back at the house, the group resumes the story of Clara as she's being recruited by Octavio, who promised her vast resources and the power to change the world.

He and Fredwynn infiltrate his old office and identify an IP address through a playlist containing the songs they've heard on their missions. Meanwhile, Janice and Simone find an apartment with one of Clara's paintings and discover her full name on a lease from 1999, Clara Torres. Through newspaper records, they trace Clara's steps back to a former psychiatric hospital Janice had been admitted to in her past, now an apartment complex. Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator.

Commander 14 shows his real face, identical in appearance to Octavio, and they give everyone a new task: to work together. The group watches a video montage of their sleuthing from earlier that day, and realize that it was still just part of the game. Clara, Octavio, and Commander 14 reveal themselves as actors, devastating Peter. All the participants head over to the game's afterparty. Fredwynn searches for the architect of the game, while Simone and Peter agree to start a relationship. Feeling left out, Janice leaves the party and recognizes a woman as the architect.

After telling Janice the truth, Lee gives her the address of the mausoleum where Clara Torres's urn is kept. There, the four discover a cassette tape in which Clara describes her dream of creating art that changes people's view of the world, the message which first inspired Lee to create the game.  Peter and Simone attempt a first date, but Simone refuses to continue a romantic relationship, insistent that Peter's na\u00efvet\u00e9 would make it impossible for them in the real world. Meanwhile, Janice finds out Lev suffered a second stroke. Fredwynn stays with her at the hospital as she decides to take him off life support.

This tradition is partly in the use of the [[Christian cross]] an emblem from the 11th century, and increasingly during the age of the [[Crusades]]. Many cross variants were developed in the classical tradition of heraldry during the late medieval and early modern periods. Heraldic crosses are inherited in modern iconographic traditions and are used in numerous [[national flag]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{stack|[[File:Seal of Niketas, commander of the Imperial Fleet.jpg|thumb|9th-century Byzantine seal showing a [[patriarchal cross]] (seal of Niketas, commander of the Byzantine imperial fleet)]]\n[[File:Bouchard3.jpg|thumb|upright|Seal of [[Bouchard de Marly]] (attested 1225), ''a cross, quarterly four [[Avalerion|alerions]]''.]]\n[[File:Amadeus5.jpg|thumb|upright|Seal of [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] (1249\u20131323), showing a knight on horseback displaying the Savoy cross on his shield, ''ailets'' (shoulder-pads) and ''caparison'' (horse covering)]]\n[[File:The Segar's Roll.jpg|thumb|<small>A section of ''Segar's Roll'', a 17th-century copy of a late 13th-century English [[roll of arms]]. Crosses are shown on the arms of:<ref>see e.g. ''The Publications of the Harleian Society'', Volume 100 (1950), p. 169.</ref> the legendary [[Prester John]] ([[attributed arms]] showing a full crucifix including the figure of Christ), the [[King of Jerusalem]] (the [[Jerusalem cross]]), the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Emperor of Constantinople]] ([[Byzantine flags and insignia|the Palaiologos dynasty emblem]] with the ''Beta''s interpreted as [[Crescent (heraldry)|crescents]]), the \"[[Principality of Achaea|King of Greece]]\", and King [[Edward the Confessor]] of England ([[attributed arms]] showing a cross and five martlets).</small>]]}}\n\nThe [[Christian cross]] emblem ([[Latin cross]] or [[Greek cross]]) was used from the 5th century, deriving from a [[Tau Cross|T-shape]] representing the [[gibbet]] (''[[stauros]]'', ''crux'') of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] in use from at least the 2nd century. The [[globus cruciger]] and the [[staurogram]] is used in Byzantine coins and seals during the [[Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty|Heraclian period]] (6th century). Under the [[Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty|Heraclian dynasty]] (7th century), coins also depict simply crosses [[cross potent|potent]], [[cross patty|patty]] or [[cross pommy|pommy]].\n\nThe cross was used as a [[field sign]] by the Christian troops during the [[Crusades]]. In 1188, Kings [[Henry II of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] agreed to launch the [[Third Crusade]] together, and that Henry would use a white cross and Philip a red cross. The red-on-white cross came to be used by the [[Knights Templar]], and the white-on-red one by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (also white-on-black); the [[Teutonic Order]] used a black-on white version. Early cross or spiral-like shield decorations, not necessarily with Christian symbolism, are already found on depictions of shields of the 11th century.<ref>[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: \"simple cross\": [[Bayeux Tapestry]], \"flared cross\" Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1 (c.1000-1050).</ref>\n\n[[History of heraldry|Heraldry]] emerged in western Europe at the start of the 13th century out of earlier traditions.

In 1188, Kings [[Henry II of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] agreed to launch the [[Third Crusade]] together, and that Henry would use a white cross and Philip a red cross. The red-on-white cross came to be used by the [[Knights Templar]], and the white-on-red one by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (also white-on-black); the [[Teutonic Order]] used a black-on white version.

When composers from the 17th century wrote pieces, they expected that these works would be performed by whatever group of musicians were available. To give one example, whereas the [[bassline]] in a 19th-century work is scored for [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es and other specific instruments, in a 17th-century work, a [[basso continuo]] part for a sinfonia would not specify which instruments would play the part. A performance of the piece might be done with a basso continuo group as small as a single cello and [[harpsichord]]. However, if a bigger budget was available for a performance and a larger sound was required, a basso continuo group might include multiple chord-playing instruments (harpsichord, [[lute]], etc.) and a range of bass instruments, including cello, double bass, bass viol or even a [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], an early bass wind instrument.\n\n==Galant and classical eras==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[three-movement form]] and [[four-movement form]] -->\nLaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson write in the second edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that \"the symphony was cultivated with extraordinary intensity\" in the 18th century.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.2, citing two scholarly catalogs listing over 13,000 distinct works: {{harvnb|LaRue|1959}} and {{harvnb|LaRue|1988}}}} It played a role in many areas of public life, including church services,{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.2}} but a particularly strong area of support for symphonic performances was the aristocracy. In Vienna, perhaps the most important location in Europe for the composition of symphonies, \"literally hundreds of noble families supported musical establishments, generally dividing their time between Vienna and their ancestral estate [elsewhere in the Empire]\". {{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.10}} Since the normal size of the orchestra at the time was quite small, many of these courtly establishments were capable of performing symphonies. The young [[Joseph Haydn]], taking up his first job as a music director in 1757 for the [[Count Morzin|Morzin family]], found that when the Morzin household was in Vienna, his own orchestra was only part of a lively and competitive musical scene, with multiple aristocrats sponsoring concerts with their own ensembles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carpani |first=Giuseppe |authorlink=Giuseppe Carpani |title=Le Haydine, ovvero Lettere su la vita e le opere del celebre maestro Giuseppe Haydn |year=1823 |edition=Second |page=66}}</ref>\n\nLaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson's article traces the gradual expansion of the symphonic orchestra through the 18th century.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.4}} At first, symphonies were string symphonies, written in just four parts: first violin, second violin, viola, and bass (the bass line was taken by cello(s), double bass(es) playing the part an octave below, and perhaps also a bassoon). Occasionally the early symphonists even dispensed with the viola part, thus creating three-part symphonies. A basso continuo part including a bassoon together with a [[harpsichord]] or other chording instrument was also possible.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.4}}\n\nThe first additions to this simple ensemble were a pair of horns, occasionally a pair of oboes, and then both horns and oboes together. Over the century, other instruments were added to the classical orchestra: flutes (sometimes replacing the oboes), separate parts for bassoons, clarinets, and trumpets and timpani. Works varied in their scoring concerning which of these additional instruments were to appear. The full-scale classical orchestra, deployed at the end of the century for the largest-scale symphonies, has the standard string ensemble mentioned above, pairs of winds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons), a pair of horns, and timpani. A keyboard continuo instrument (harpsichord or [[piano]]) remained an option.\n\nThe \"Italian\" style of symphony, often used as overture and [[entr'acte]] in [[opera house]]s, became a standard three-movement form: a fast movement, a slow movement, and another fast movement. Over the course of the 18th century it became the custom to write four-movement symphonies,<ref>{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Hepokoski |first2=Warren |last2=Darcy |year=2006 |title=Elements of Sonata Theory : Norms, Types, and Deformations in the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fHasTaNQmK0C&dq=mozart+four+movements+three+movements+symphony |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=320 |isbn=0198033451 |ref=harv}}</ref> along the lines described in the next paragraph.

Haydn, Mozart and their contemporaries restricted their use of the four-movement form to orchestral or multi-instrument chamber music such as quartets, though since Beethoven solo sonatas are as often written in four as in three movements.{{sfn|Prout|1895|page=249}}\n\nThe composition of early symphonies was centred on Milan, Vienna, and [[Mannheim]]. The Milanese school centred around [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]] and included [[Antonio Brioschi]], Ferdinando Galimberti and [[Giovanni Battista Lampugnani]]. Early exponents of the form in Vienna included [[Georg Christoph Wagenseil]], [[Wenzel Raimund Birck]] and [[Georg Matthias Monn]], while later significant Viennese composers of symphonies included [[Johann Baptist Wanhal]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] and [[Leopold Hofmann]]. The [[Mannheim school]] included [[Johann Stamitz]].{{sfn|Anon.|n.d.}}\n\nThe most important symphonists of the latter part of the 18th century are Haydn, who wrote at least 107 symphonies over the course of 36 years,{{sfn|Webster|2001}} and Mozart, with at least 47 symphonies in 24 years.{{sfn|Eisen|Sadie|2001}}\n\n==Romantic era==\n{{listen|type=music|header=Beethoven's Symphony No. 5\n|filename=Ludwig van Beethoven - symphony no. 5 in c minor, op. 67 - i. allegro con brio.ogg|title=First movement: Allegro con brio\n|filename2=Ludwig van Beethoven - symphony no. 5 in c minor, op. 67 - ii. andante con moto.ogg|title2=Second movement: Andante con moto\n|filename3=Ludwig van Beethoven - symphony no. 5 in c minor, op. 67 - iii. allegro.ogg|title3=Third movement: Scherzo.

His [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] is perhaps the most famous symphony ever written; its transition from the emotionally stormy [[Beethoven and C minor|C minor]] opening movement to a triumphant major-key finale provided a model adopted by later symphonists such as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]{{sfn|Libbey|1999|page=40}} and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} His [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6]] is a [[program music|programmatic]] work, featuring instrumental imitations of bird calls and a storm; and, unconventionally, a fifth movement (symphonies usually had at most four movements). His [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] includes parts for vocal soloists and choir in the last movement, making it a [[choral symphony]].<ref>Beethoven's Ninth is not the first choral symphony, though it is surely the most celebrated one. Beethoven was anticipated by [[Peter von Winter]]'s ''Schlacht-Sinfonie'' (\"Battle Symphony\"), which includes a concluding chorus and was written in 1814, ten years before Beethoven's Ninth. Source: {{harvnb|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001}}</ref>\n\nOf the symphonies of [[Franz Schubert]], two are core repertory items and are frequently performed. Of the [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Eighth Symphony]] (1822), Schubert completed only the first two movements; this highly Romantic work is usually called by its nickname \"The Unfinished\". His last completed symphony, the [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Ninth]] (1826) is a massive work in the Classical idiom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Charles |year=1997 |title=The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven |edition=expanded |place=London |publisher=Faber and Faber |isbn=9780571192878 |oclc=38185106 |page=521 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nOf the early Romantics, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (five symphonies) and [[Robert Schumann]] (four) continued to write symphonies in the classical mold, though using their own musical language. In contrast, [[Hector Berlioz]] favored programmatic works, including his \"dramatic symphony\" ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (Berlioz)|Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', the viola symphony ''[[Harold en Italie]]'' and the highly original ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''. The latter is also a programme work and has both a march and a [[waltz]] and five movements instead of the customary four. His fourth and last symphony, the ''[[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]]'' (originally titled ''Symphonie militaire'') was composed in 1840 for a 200-piece [[Marching band|marching]] [[military band]], to be performed out of doors, and is an early example of a band symphony. Berlioz later added optional string parts and a choral finale.{{sfn|Macdonald|2001|loc=\u00a73: 1831\u201342}} In 1851, [[Richard Wagner]] declared that all of these post-Beethoven symphonies were no more than an epilogue, offering nothing substantially new. Indeed, after Schumann's last symphony, the \"Rhenish\" composed in 1850, for two decades the [[Franz Liszt|Lisztian]] [[symphonic poem]] appeared to have displaced the symphony as the leading form of large-scale instrumental music.  However, Liszt also composed two programmatic choral symphonies during this time, ''[[Faust Symphony|Faust]]'' and ''[[Dante Symphony|Dante]]''. If the symphony had otherwise been eclipsed, it was not long before it re-emerged in a \"second age\" in the 1870s and 1880s, with the symphonies of [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Alexander Borodin]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]\u2014works which largely avoided the programmatic elements of Berioz and Liszt and dominated the concert repertory for at least a century.<ref name=\"Dahlhaus1989\">{{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1989|page=265}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the 19th century, composers continued to add to the size of the symphonic orchestra. Around the beginning of the century, a full-scale orchestra would consist of the string section plus pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and lastly a set of timpani.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}} This is, for instance, the scoring used in Beethoven's symphonies [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|numbered 1]], [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|2]], [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|4]], [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7]], and [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)|8]]. Trombones, which had previously been confined to church and theater music, came to be added to the symphonic orchestra, notably in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|6th]], and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th]] symphonies. The combination of bass drum, triangle, and cymbals (sometimes also: piccolo), which 18th century composers employed as a coloristic effect in so-called \"[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish music]]\", came to be increasingly used during the second half of the 19th century without any such connotations of genre.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}} By the time of Mahler (see below), it was possible for a composer to write a symphony scored for \"a veritable compendium of orchestral instruments\".{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}} In addition to increasing in variety of instruments, 19th century symphonies were gradually augmented with more string players and more wind parts, so that the orchestra grew substantially in sheer numbers, as concert halls likewise grew.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}}\n\n==Modernist and postmodernist eras==\nTowards the end of the 19th century, [[Gustav Mahler]] began writing long, large-scale symphonies that he continued composing into the early 20th century. His [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]], completed in 1896, is one of the longest regularly performed symphonies at around 100 minutes in length for most performances.  The [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] was composed in 1906 and is nicknamed the \"Symphony of a Thousand\" because of the large number of voices required to perform the work. \n\nThe 20th century saw further diversification in the style and content of works that composers labeled ''symphonies'' (Anon. 2008). Some composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], and [[Carl Nielsen]], continued to write in the traditional four-movement form, while other composers took different approaches: [[Jean Sibelius]]' [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 7]], his last, is in one movement, whereas [[Alan Hovhaness]]'s Symphony No. 9, ''Saint Vartan''\u2014originally op. 80, changed to op. 180\u2014composed in 1949\u201350, is in twenty-four.{{sfn|Tawa|2001|page=352}}\n\nA concern with unification of the traditional four-movement symphony into a single, subsuming formal conception had emerged in the late 19th century. This has been called a \"two-dimensional symphonic form\", and finds its key turning point in [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1]], Op. 9 (1909), which was followed in the 1920s by other notable single-movement German symphonies, including [[Kurt Weill]]'s First Symphony (1921), [[Max Butting]]'s Chamber Symphony, Op. 25 (1923), and [[Paul Dessau]]'s 1926 Symphony.{{sfn|Vande Moortele|2013|loc=269, 284n9}}\n\nThere remained, however, certain tendencies. Designating a work a \"symphony\" still implied a degree of sophistication and seriousness of purpose. The word ''[[Sinfonietta (symphony)|sinfonietta]]'' came into use to designate a work that is shorter, of more modest aims, or \"lighter\" than a symphony, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Sinfonietta (Prokofiev)|Sinfonietta]] for [[orchestra]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006a}}{{sfn|Temperley|2001}}\n\nIn the first half of the century, modernist composers including [[Edward Elgar]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Jean Sibelius]], Carl Nielsen, [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]], [[Roger Sessions]], Sergei Prokofiev, [[Rued Langgaard]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] composed symphonies \"extraordinary in scope, richness, originality, and urgency of expression\".{{sfn|Steinberg|1995|loc=404}} One measure of the significance of a symphony is the degree to which it reflects conceptions of temporal form particular to the age in which it was created. Five composers from across the span of the 20th century who fulfil this measure are Jean Sibelius, Igor Stravinsky, [[Luciano Berio]] (in his [[Sinfonia (Berio)|Sinfonia]], 1968\u201369), [[Elliott Carter]] (in his ''Symphony of Three Orchestras'', 1976), and [[Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen]] (in ''Symphony/Antiphony'', 1980).<ref>\n{{Citation |last=Grimley |first=Daniel M |year=2013 |contribution=Symphony/Antiphony: Formal Strategies in the Twentieth-Century Symphony |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Symphony |editor=Julian Horton |page=287 |series=Cambridge Companions to Music. |location=Cambridge and New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521884983 |oclc=795504217}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-20th century into the 21st there has been a resurgence of interest in the symphony with many postmodernist composers adding substantially to the canon, not least in the United Kingdom: [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] (10),<ref>https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/contemporary-composer-sir-peter-maxwell-davies</ref> [[Robin Holloway]] (1),<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e9bv4f</ref> [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]] (9),<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/05/how-does-david-matthews-get-away-with-writing-symphonies-with-tunes-in-them/</ref> [[James MacMillan]] (4),<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/04/bbcsso-runnicles-review-prom-24-macmillan-mahler</ref> [[Peter Seabourne]] (4),<ref>http://theclassicalreviewer.blogspot.com/2016/07/peter-seabournes-symphony-of-roses-is.html</ref> and Philip Sawyers (3).<ref>https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/sawyers-symphony-no-3-songs-of-loss-and-regret</ref>.\n\n==Symphonies for concert band==\n[[Hector Berlioz]] originally wrote the ''[[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]]'' for [[military band]] in 1840. After that, few symphonies were written for wind bands until the 20th century when more symphonies were written for [[concert band]] than in past centuries. Although examples exist from as early as 1932, the first such symphony of importance is [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s Symphony No. 19, Op. 46, composed in 1939 (Battisti 2002, 42).

We are already more open than Grove by saying \"most often\" before \"written for orchestra\"--> Although the term has had many meanings from its origins in the ancient Greek era, by the late 18th century the word had taken on the meaning common today: a work usually consisting of multiple distinct sections or [[movement (music)|movements]], often four, with the first movement in [[sonata form]]. Symphonies are almost always scored for an orchestra consisting of a [[string section]] ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]]), [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] [[Musical instrument|instruments]] which altogether number about 30 to 100 musicians. Symphonies are notated in a [[Full score|musical score]], which contains all the instrument parts. Orchestral musicians play from parts which contain just the notated music for their own instrument. Some symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]).\n\n==Origins==\nThe word ''symphony'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}} ({{Transl|grc|symphonia}}), meaning \"agreement or concord of sound\", \"concert of vocal or instrumental music\", from {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{Transl|grc|symph\u014dnos}}), \"harmonious\".<ref name=\"OED\">{{Wikicite|ref={{harvid|OED}}|reference={{citation|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=online version|contribution=Symphony|contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/196292?redirectedFrom=symphony#eid}}}}</ref> The word referred to a variety of different concepts before ultimately settling on its current meaning designating a musical form.\n\nIn late Greek and medieval theory, the word was used for [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]], as opposed to {{Lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}} ({{Transl|grc|diaph\u014dnia}}), which was the word for \"dissonance\".<ref name=\"Brown2001\">{{harvnb|Brown|2001}}</ref> In the Middle Ages and later, the Latin form ''symphonia'' was used to describe various instruments, especially those capable of producing more than one sound simultaneously.<ref name=\"Brown2001\"/> [[Isidore of Seville]] was the first to use the word symphonia as the name of a two-headed drum, and from c. 1155 to 1377 the French form ''symphonie'' was the name of the ''organistrum'' or [[hurdy-gurdy]]. In late medieval England, ''symphony'' was used in both of these senses, whereas by the 16th century it was equated with the [[appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]]. In German, ''Symphonie'' was a generic term for [[spinet]]s and [[virginals]] from the late 16th century to the 18th century.{{sfn|Marcuse|1975|page=501}}\n\nIn the sense of \"sounding together,\" the word begins to appear in the titles of some works by 16th- and 17th-century composers including [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]'s ''Sacrae symphoniae'', and ''Symphoniae sacrae, liber secundus'', published in 1597 and 1615, respectively; [[Adriano Banchieri]]'s ''Eclesiastiche sinfonie, dette canzoni in aria francese, per sonare, et cantare'', op. 16, published in 1607; [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana]]'s ''Sinfonie musicali'', op. 18, published in 1610; and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''[[Symphoniae sacrae I|Symphoniae sacrae]]'', op. 6, and ''Symphoniarum sacrarum secunda pars'', op. 10, published in 1629 and 1647, respectively. Except for Viadana's collection, which contained purely instrumental and secular music, these were all collections of sacred vocal works, some with instrumental accompaniment.{{sfn|Bowman|1971|page=7}}{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001}}\n\n==Baroque era==\nIn the 17th century, for most of the Baroque era, the terms ''symphony'' and ''sinfonia'' were used for a range of different compositions, including instrumental pieces used in [[opera]]s, [[sonata]]s and [[concerto]]s\u2014usually part of a larger work. The ''opera sinfonia'', or ''Italian [[overture]]'' had, by the 18th century, a standard structure of three contrasting movements: fast, slow, fast and dance-like. It is this form that is often considered as the direct forerunner of the orchestral symphony. The terms \"overture\", \"symphony\" and \"sinfonia\" were widely regarded as interchangeable for much of the 18th century.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001}}\n\nIn the 17th century, pieces scored for large instrumental ensemble did not precisely designate which instruments were to play which parts, as is the practice from the 19th century to the current period. When composers from the 17th century wrote pieces, they expected that these works would be performed by whatever group of musicians were available. To give one example, whereas the [[bassline]] in a 19th-century work is scored for [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es and other specific instruments, in a 17th-century work, a [[basso continuo]] part for a sinfonia would not specify which instruments would play the part. A performance of the piece might be done with a basso continuo group as small as a single cello and [[harpsichord]]. However, if a bigger budget was available for a performance and a larger sound was required, a basso continuo group might include multiple chord-playing instruments (harpsichord, [[lute]], etc.) and a range of bass instruments, including cello, double bass, bass viol or even a [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], an early bass wind instrument.\n\n==Galant and classical eras==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[three-movement form]] and [[four-movement form]] -->\nLaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson write in the second edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that \"the symphony was cultivated with extraordinary intensity\" in the 18th century.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.2, citing two scholarly catalogs listing over 13,000 distinct works: {{harvnb|LaRue|1959}} and {{harvnb|LaRue|1988}}}} It played a role in many areas of public life, including church services,{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.2}} but a particularly strong area of support for symphonic performances was the aristocracy. In Vienna, perhaps the most important location in Europe for the composition of symphonies, \"literally hundreds of noble families supported musical establishments, generally dividing their time between Vienna and their ancestral estate [elsewhere in the Empire]\". {{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.10}} Since the normal size of the orchestra at the time was quite small, many of these courtly establishments were capable of performing symphonies. The young [[Joseph Haydn]], taking up his first job as a music director in 1757 for the [[Count Morzin|Morzin family]], found that when the Morzin household was in Vienna, his own orchestra was only part of a lively and competitive musical scene, with multiple aristocrats sponsoring concerts with their own ensembles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carpani |first=Giuseppe |authorlink=Giuseppe Carpani |title=Le Haydine, ovvero Lettere su la vita e le opere del celebre maestro Giuseppe Haydn |year=1823 |edition=Second |page=66}}</ref>\n\nLaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson's article traces the gradual expansion of the symphonic orchestra through the 18th century.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.4}} At first, symphonies were string symphonies, written in just four parts: first violin, second violin, viola, and bass (the bass line was taken by cello(s), double bass(es) playing the part an octave below, and perhaps also a bassoon). Occasionally the early symphonists even dispensed with the viola part, thus creating three-part symphonies. A basso continuo part including a bassoon together with a [[harpsichord]] or other chording instrument was also possible.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=\u00a7I.4}}\n\nThe first additions to this simple ensemble were a pair of horns, occasionally a pair of oboes, and then both horns and oboes together. Over the century, other instruments were added to the classical orchestra: flutes (sometimes replacing the oboes), separate parts for bassoons, clarinets, and trumpets and timpani. Works varied in their scoring concerning which of these additional instruments were to appear. The full-scale classical orchestra, deployed at the end of the century for the largest-scale symphonies, has the standard string ensemble mentioned above, pairs of winds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons), a pair of horns, and timpani. A keyboard continuo instrument (harpsichord or [[piano]]) remained an option.\n\nThe \"Italian\" style of symphony, often used as overture and [[entr'acte]] in [[opera house]]s, became a standard three-movement form: a fast movement, a slow movement, and another fast movement. Over the course of the 18th century it became the custom to write four-movement symphonies,<ref>{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Hepokoski |first2=Warren |last2=Darcy |year=2006 |title=Elements of Sonata Theory : Norms, Types, and Deformations in the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fHasTaNQmK0C&dq=mozart+four+movements+three+movements+symphony |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=320 |isbn=0198033451 |ref=harv}}</ref> along the lines described in the next paragraph.

Haydn, Mozart and their contemporaries restricted their use of the four-movement form to orchestral or multi-instrument chamber music such as quartets, though since Beethoven solo sonatas are as often written in four as in three movements.{{sfn|Prout|1895|page=249}}\n\nThe composition of early symphonies was centred on Milan, Vienna, and [[Mannheim]]. The Milanese school centred around [[Giovanni Battista Sammartini]] and included [[Antonio Brioschi]], Ferdinando Galimberti and [[Giovanni Battista Lampugnani]]. Early exponents of the form in Vienna included [[Georg Christoph Wagenseil]], [[Wenzel Raimund Birck]] and [[Georg Matthias Monn]], while later significant Viennese composers of symphonies included [[Johann Baptist Wanhal]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf]] and [[Leopold Hofmann]]. The [[Mannheim school]] included [[Johann Stamitz]].{{sfn|Anon.|n.d.}}\n\nThe most important symphonists of the latter part of the 18th century are Haydn, who wrote at least 107 symphonies over the course of 36 years,{{sfn|Webster|2001}} and Mozart, with at least 47 symphonies in 24 years.{{sfn|Eisen|Sadie|2001}}\n\n==Romantic era==\n{{listen|type=music|header=Beethoven's Symphony No. 5\n|filename=Ludwig van Beethoven - symphony no. 5 in c minor, op. 67 - i. allegro con brio.ogg|title=First movement: Allegro con brio\n|filename2=Ludwig van Beethoven - symphony no. 5 in c minor, op. 67 - ii. andante con moto.ogg|title2=Second movement: Andante con moto\n|filename3=Ludwig van Beethoven - symphony no. 5 in c minor, op. 67 - iii. allegro.ogg|title3=Third movement: Scherzo.

Music courtesy of [[Musopen]]}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] elevated the symphony from an everyday genre produced in large quantities to a supreme form in which composers strove to reach the highest potential of music in just a few works.<ref name=\"Dahlhaus1989\"/> Beethoven began with two works directly emulating his models Mozart and Haydn, then seven more symphonies, starting with the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] (\"Eroica\") that expanded the scope and ambition of the genre. His [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] is perhaps the most famous symphony ever written; its transition from the emotionally stormy [[Beethoven and C minor|C minor]] opening movement to a triumphant major-key finale provided a model adopted by later symphonists such as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]{{sfn|Libbey|1999|page=40}} and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} His [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6]] is a [[program music|programmatic]] work, featuring instrumental imitations of bird calls and a storm; and, unconventionally, a fifth movement (symphonies usually had at most four movements). His [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] includes parts for vocal soloists and choir in the last movement, making it a [[choral symphony]].<ref>Beethoven's Ninth is not the first choral symphony, though it is surely the most celebrated one. Beethoven was anticipated by [[Peter von Winter]]'s ''Schlacht-Sinfonie'' (\"Battle Symphony\"), which includes a concluding chorus and was written in 1814, ten years before Beethoven's Ninth. Source: {{harvnb|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001}}</ref>\n\nOf the symphonies of [[Franz Schubert]], two are core repertory items and are frequently performed. Of the [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Eighth Symphony]] (1822), Schubert completed only the first two movements; this highly Romantic work is usually called by its nickname \"The Unfinished\". His last completed symphony, the [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Ninth]] (1826) is a massive work in the Classical idiom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Charles |year=1997 |title=The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven |edition=expanded |place=London |publisher=Faber and Faber |isbn=9780571192878 |oclc=38185106 |page=521 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nOf the early Romantics, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] (five symphonies) and [[Robert Schumann]] (four) continued to write symphonies in the classical mold, though using their own musical language. In contrast, [[Hector Berlioz]] favored programmatic works, including his \"dramatic symphony\" ''[[Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (Berlioz)|Rom\u00e9o et Juliette]]'', the viola symphony ''[[Harold en Italie]]'' and the highly original ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''. The latter is also a programme work and has both a march and a [[waltz]] and five movements instead of the customary four. His fourth and last symphony, the ''[[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]]'' (originally titled ''Symphonie militaire'') was composed in 1840 for a 200-piece [[Marching band|marching]] [[military band]], to be performed out of doors, and is an early example of a band symphony. Berlioz later added optional string parts and a choral finale.{{sfn|Macdonald|2001|loc=\u00a73: 1831\u201342}} In 1851, [[Richard Wagner]] declared that all of these post-Beethoven symphonies were no more than an epilogue, offering nothing substantially new. Indeed, after Schumann's last symphony, the \"Rhenish\" composed in 1850, for two decades the [[Franz Liszt|Lisztian]] [[symphonic poem]] appeared to have displaced the symphony as the leading form of large-scale instrumental music.  However, Liszt also composed two programmatic choral symphonies during this time, ''[[Faust Symphony|Faust]]'' and ''[[Dante Symphony|Dante]]''. If the symphony had otherwise been eclipsed, it was not long before it re-emerged in a \"second age\" in the 1870s and 1880s, with the symphonies of [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[Alexander Borodin]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]\u2014works which largely avoided the programmatic elements of Berioz and Liszt and dominated the concert repertory for at least a century.<ref name=\"Dahlhaus1989\">{{harvnb|Dahlhaus|1989|page=265}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the 19th century, composers continued to add to the size of the symphonic orchestra. Around the beginning of the century, a full-scale orchestra would consist of the string section plus pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and lastly a set of timpani.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}} This is, for instance, the scoring used in Beethoven's symphonies [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|numbered 1]], [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|2]], [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|4]], [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7]], and [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)|8]]. Trombones, which had previously been confined to church and theater music, came to be added to the symphonic orchestra, notably in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|6th]], and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|9th]] symphonies. The combination of bass drum, triangle, and cymbals (sometimes also: piccolo), which 18th century composers employed as a coloristic effect in so-called \"[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish music]]\", came to be increasingly used during the second half of the 19th century without any such connotations of genre.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}} By the time of Mahler (see below), it was possible for a composer to write a symphony scored for \"a veritable compendium of orchestral instruments\".{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}} In addition to increasing in variety of instruments, 19th century symphonies were gradually augmented with more string players and more wind parts, so that the orchestra grew substantially in sheer numbers, as concert halls likewise grew.{{sfnp|LaRue, Bonds, Walsh, and Wilson|2001|loc=II.1}}\n\n==Modernist and postmodernist eras==\nTowards the end of the 19th century, [[Gustav Mahler]] began writing long, large-scale symphonies that he continued composing into the early 20th century. His [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]], completed in 1896, is one of the longest regularly performed symphonies at around 100 minutes in length for most performances.  The [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] was composed in 1906 and is nicknamed the \"Symphony of a Thousand\" because of the large number of voices required to perform the work. \n\nThe 20th century saw further diversification in the style and content of works that composers labeled ''symphonies'' (Anon. 2008). Some composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], and [[Carl Nielsen]], continued to write in the traditional four-movement form, while other composers took different approaches: [[Jean Sibelius]]' [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 7]], his last, is in one movement, whereas [[Alan Hovhaness]]'s Symphony No. 9, ''Saint Vartan''\u2014originally op. 80, changed to op. 180\u2014composed in 1949\u201350, is in twenty-four.{{sfn|Tawa|2001|page=352}}\n\nA concern with unification of the traditional four-movement symphony into a single, subsuming formal conception had emerged in the late 19th century. This has been called a \"two-dimensional symphonic form\", and finds its key turning point in [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1]], Op. 9 (1909), which was followed in the 1920s by other notable single-movement German symphonies, including [[Kurt Weill]]'s First Symphony (1921), [[Max Butting]]'s Chamber Symphony, Op. 25 (1923), and [[Paul Dessau]]'s 1926 Symphony.{{sfn|Vande Moortele|2013|loc=269, 284n9}}\n\nThere remained, however, certain tendencies. Designating a work a \"symphony\" still implied a degree of sophistication and seriousness of purpose. The word ''[[Sinfonietta (symphony)|sinfonietta]]'' came into use to designate a work that is shorter, of more modest aims, or \"lighter\" than a symphony, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Sinfonietta (Prokofiev)|Sinfonietta]] for [[orchestra]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2006a}}{{sfn|Temperley|2001}}\n\nIn the first half of the century, modernist composers including [[Edward Elgar]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Jean Sibelius]], Carl Nielsen, [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]], [[Roger Sessions]], Sergei Prokofiev, [[Rued Langgaard]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] composed symphonies \"extraordinary in scope, richness, originality, and urgency of expression\".{{sfn|Steinberg|1995|loc=404}} One measure of the significance of a symphony is the degree to which it reflects conceptions of temporal form particular to the age in which it was created. Five composers from across the span of the 20th century who fulfil this measure are Jean Sibelius, Igor Stravinsky, [[Luciano Berio]] (in his [[Sinfonia (Berio)|Sinfonia]], 1968\u201369), [[Elliott Carter]] (in his ''Symphony of Three Orchestras'', 1976), and [[Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen]] (in ''Symphony/Antiphony'', 1980).<ref>\n{{Citation |last=Grimley |first=Daniel M |year=2013 |contribution=Symphony/Antiphony: Formal Strategies in the Twentieth-Century Symphony |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Symphony |editor=Julian Horton |page=287 |series=Cambridge Companions to Music. |location=Cambridge and New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521884983 |oclc=795504217}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-20th century into the 21st there has been a resurgence of interest in the symphony with many postmodernist composers adding substantially to the canon, not least in the United Kingdom: [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] (10),<ref>https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/contemporary-composer-sir-peter-maxwell-davies</ref> [[Robin Holloway]] (1),<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e9bv4f</ref> [[David Matthews (composer)|David Matthews]] (9),<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/05/how-does-david-matthews-get-away-with-writing-symphonies-with-tunes-in-them/</ref> [[James MacMillan]] (4),<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/04/bbcsso-runnicles-review-prom-24-macmillan-mahler</ref> [[Peter Seabourne]] (4),<ref>http://theclassicalreviewer.blogspot.com/2016/07/peter-seabournes-symphony-of-roses-is.html</ref> and Philip Sawyers (3).<ref>https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/sawyers-symphony-no-3-songs-of-loss-and-regret</ref>.\n\n==Symphonies for concert band==\n[[Hector Berlioz]] originally wrote the ''[[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]]'' for [[military band]] in 1840. After that, few symphonies were written for wind bands until the 20th century when more symphonies were written for [[concert band]] than in past centuries. Although examples exist from as early as 1932, the first such symphony of importance is [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s Symphony No. 19, Op. 46, composed in 1939 (Battisti 2002, 42). Some further examples are [[Paul Hindemith]]'s [[Symphony in B-flat for Band (Hindemith)|Symphony in B-flat for Band]], composed in 1951{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!--Source verifying notability needed.-->; [[Morton Gould]]'s Symphony No. 4 \"West Point\", composed in 1952; [[Vincent Persichetti]]'s Symphony No. 6, Op. 69, composed in 1956; [[Vittorio Giannini]]'s Symphony No.3, composed in 1959{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}<!--Source verifying notability needed.-->; Alan Hovhaness's Symphonies No. 4, op.&nbsp;165, No.&nbsp;7, \"Nanga Parvat\", op.&nbsp;175, No.&nbsp;14, \"Ararat\", op.&nbsp;194, and No.&nbsp;23, \"Ani\", op.&nbsp;249, composed in 1958, 1959, 1961, and 1972 respectively{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!--Source verifying notability needed.-->; [[Alfred Reed]]'s 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th symphonies, composed in 1979, 1988, 1992, and 1994 respectively{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!--Source verifying notability needed.-->; and [[Johan de Meij]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 \"The Lord of the Rings\"]], composed in 1988, and his Symphony No. 2 \"The Big Apple\", composed in 1993{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}<!--Source verifying notability needed.-->.\n\n==Other modern usages of \"symphony\"==\nIn some forms of English, for example [[U.S. English]] the word \"symphony\" is also used to refer to the [[orchestra]], the large ensemble that often performs these works. The word \"symphony\" appears in the name of many orchestras, for example, the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], the [[St. Louis Symphony]], the [[Houston Symphony]], or Miami's [[New World Symphony (orchestra)|New World Symphony]]. For some orchestras, \"(city name) Symphony\" provides a shorter version of the full name; for instance, the [[OED]] gives \"Vancouver Symphony\" as a possible abbreviated form of [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfnp|OED||loc=definition 5d |ps=:''ellipt.'' for 'symphony orchestra'}}<ref>{{cite book|year=1926|author1=[[Paul Whiteman]]|author2=[[Mary Margaret McBride]]|title=Jazz|at=xiv. 287|quote=The unknown composer has to pay to get his compositions played by a good symphony.}}</ref> Additionally, in common usage, a person may say they are going out to hear a symphony perform, a reference to the orchestra and not the works on the program.

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

He generally played the small forward position during his NBA career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/08/versatile-nba-players-history/grant-hill|title=The 25 Most Versatile Players in NBA History|last=Sibor|first=Doug|work=Complex.com|date=August 14, 2013|access-date=November 25, 2019}}</ref> In his first season, he averaged 19.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.77 steals per game, and became the first Pistons rookie since [[Isiah Thomas]] in [[1981\u201382 NBA season|1981\u201382]] to score 1000 points. Hill ended up sharing [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] honors with [[Jason Kidd]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]], becoming the first Piston since [[Dave Bing]] in [[1966\u201367 NBA season|1966\u201367]] to win the award. Hill also won the ''[[Sporting News]]'' Rookie of the Year Award. He was named to the all-NBA First Team in 1997, and all-NBA Second Teams in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Hill also regularly played in the [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]], where he made history by being the first rookie to lead an NBA All-Star fan balloting in ([[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395]]) with 1,289,585 votes,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6325252_ITM | work=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service | title=Hill's record 1,289,585 votes will go down in all-star history.

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nGrant was only a Yes man.

Grant also caused a massive title wave title like a book mow tidal. Lets be clear with this Title not tidal. Grant also drank glutton free soda which allowed him to be 15ft tall.  \n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007. On July 5 Hill's agent, [[Lon Babby]], said Hill intended to sign with the [[2007\u201308 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] on July 11 (the first day free agents can officially sign contracts).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2926650 Hill to sign with Phoenix after agreeing to two-year deal] July 5, 2007</ref> Hill earned $1.83 million for [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308]] with a $1.97 million player option for the next year. Hill was named captain along with [[Steve Nash]]. Hill was given permission by [[Phoenix Suns Ring of Honor|Suns Ring of Honor]] member, [[Alvan Adams]], to wear his familiar No. 33 with the Suns. Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season.

After playing [[college basketball]] for [[Duke University]], Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA): The [[Detroit Pistons]], the [[Orlando Magic]], the [[Phoenix Suns]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. For most of his career, he played the small forward position. Hill also co-hosts ''[[NBA Inside Stuff]]'' on [[NBA TV]].\n\nHill played basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] for four years. He was the 1994 [[Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|ACC Player of the Year]], a two-time [[NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American]], and a two-time [[List of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball champions|NCAA champion]]. Hill was touted as one of the best players in Duke history and as one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke in 1994, Hill was selected by the [[Detroit Pistons]] with the third overall pick in the [[1994 NBA draft|NBA draft]]. He was the co-winner of the 1995 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Early in his NBA career, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[assist (basketball)|assists]]. In his first six seasons in the NBA, Hill averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game and made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team five times. However, the trajectory of his career was altered by a 2000 ankle injury. The injury continued to plague him for several years, led to a March 2003 surgery that was followed by life-threatening complications, and forced him to miss the entire 2003\u201304 season. In 2005, Hill made the Eastern Conference All-Star Team as a member of the Magic. He played in the Western Conference Finals in 2010 during his tenure with the Phoenix Suns. In the 12 seasons following his ankle injury, Hill averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. He is a seven-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], a five-time [[All-NBA]] selection, and a three-time winner of the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]]. In 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nAn ownership group including Hill and [[Tony Ressler]] purchased the [[Atlanta Hawks]] on June 24, 2015.\n\n==College basketball career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen the time came to choose a college, Hill's mother told the [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] documentary ''[[Beyond the Glory]]'', that she wanted him to attend [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], while his father preferred the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]]. Hill decided to attend [[Duke University]], playing four years with the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Blue Devils]] and winning national titles in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]]. Duke became the first Division I program to win consecutive titles since [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1973]]. Despite losing two of the biggest contributors on the Blue Devils, [[Christian Laettner]] (in 1992) and [[Bobby Hurley]] (each of whom went on to play in the NBA), Hill led Duke to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] once again in [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994]], but lost to [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] [[1993\u201394 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Razorbacks]]. Hill won the [[Henry Iba Corinthian Award]] as the nation's top defensive player in 1993, and in 1994 he was the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Player of the Year. During his collegiate career, Hill became the first player in ACC history to collect more than 1,900 points, 700 rebounds, 400 assists, 200 steals and 100 blocked shots. As a result of his successful college career, he became the eighth player in Duke history to have his jersey number (33) retired. After his freshman season at Duke, Hill played on the bronze medal-winning U.S. team at the [[1991 Pan American Games]], held in [[Havana]], Cuba.\n\nHill also is widely known for his role in a desperation play in an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] regional final against [[1991\u201392 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 1992, which is considered by many to be [[The Shot (Duke\u2013Kentucky)|one of the greatest college basketball games of all time]]. With Duke down 103\u2013102 in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] and 2.1 seconds remaining after Kentucky's [[Sean Woods]] hit a floater, an unguarded Hill heaved the in-bounds pass 75 feet across the court into the hands of Laettner, who dribbled once and spun before pulling up to make the game-winning jumper from just outside the free-throw line as time expired.\n\nTouted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that Hill was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players of his era.<ref>Brodess, Doug (October 24, 2011).

In addition, he became the first rookie in any of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] to lead all-star fan voting.\n\nIn his second season ([[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]), he once again led the All-Star fan balloting, this time edging [[Michael Jordan]] (Jordan's first All-Star game after returning since retiring in 1993). During the 1995\u201396 season, Hill showcased his all-round abilities by leading the NBA in [[triple-double]]s (10). He also won a [[gold medal]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]] as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team#1996 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team|U.S. men's basketball team]], where he had the team's fifth highest scoring average (9.7) and led the team in steals (18). In [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], Hill averaged 21.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals per game. He became the first player since [[Larry Bird]] in [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]] to average 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a season, an accomplishment that had not been duplicated until [[Russell Westbrook]] averaged a triple-double in the [[2016-17 NBA season]]. Once again, Hill led the league in triple-doubles, where his 13 triple-doubles represented 35 percent of the league's triple-double total that season. He was the league's Player of the Month for January and was also awarded NBA's [[IBM Award]], given to the player with the biggest statistical contributions to his team. He finished third in [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] voting, behind [[Karl Malone]] and Michael Jordan.\n\nMuch like [[Scottie Pippen]] with the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]], Hill assumed the role of a \"[[point forward]]\" in Detroit, running the Pistons' offense. As a result, between the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]] and [[1998\u201399 NBA season]]s, Hill was the league leader in assists per game among non-guards all four seasons. In the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|lockout-shortened 1999 season]], as he led his team in points, rebounds and assists for the third time, Hill joined [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]] as the only players in NBA history to lead their teams in scoring, rebounding and assists more than once. Hill and Chamberlain are the only two players in league history to lead their teams in points, rebounds and assists per game three times. Hill was selected to play in the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]], but in the end no NBA players played in this tournament due to the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].\n\nIn [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], Hill averaged 25.8 points while shooting 49% from the field, the season's third highest scoring average, behind MVP [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Allen Iverson]]. He averaged 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game. However, despite Hill's individual accomplishments in Detroit, the Pistons never made it far in the playoffs, either losing in the first round ([[1996 NBA Playoffs|1996]], [[1997 NBA Playoffs|1997]] and [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]]), or missing the playoffs entirely in the 1994\u201395 and [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 seasons]]. The [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000 playoffs]] would be no different. On April 15, 2000, 7 days before the start of the playoffs, Hill sprained his left ankle in a game against the [[1999\u20132000 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]]. He continued to play until the first round playoff series against the [[1999\u20132000 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], in which his injured ankle got worse and Hill was forced to leave halfway through game 2. Eventually, the Heat swept the Pistons 3\u20130. Hill was initially selected for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] U.S. team, but could not play due to the ankle injury. That ankle injury would prove to be a major liability for many years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/17/grant-hill-on-wfan-ankle-nightmare-would-have-been-avoided-with-knicks/|title=Grant Hill: Ankle Nightmare Would Have Been Avoided With Knicks|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first six seasons of his career, before ankle injury, Hill had amassed a total of 9,393 points, 3,417 rebounds and 2,720 assists. [[Oscar Robertson]], Bird, and [[LeBron James]] are the only three players in league history to eclipse these numbers after their first six seasons.\n\n===Orlando Magic (2000\u20132007)===\nAs an unrestricted free agent, Hill had planned to sign with the [[2000\u201301 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]]. On August 3, 2000, however, a sign-and-trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing him. The Pistons signed Hill to a seven-year, $92.8 million contract and traded him to Orlando for [[Chucky Atkins]] and [[Ben Wallace]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Magic's Strength No Illusion|date = August 3, 2000|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/magics-strength-no-illusion/|work = CBS News|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}</ref> The Magic hoped he would team up with budding superstar [[Tracy McGrady]], who had been signed away from the [[Toronto Raptors]] at that time, to return Orlando among the NBA elite. But Hill was hampered by ankle injuries, playing in only four games in his [[2000\u201301 NBA season|first]] season with the Magic, 14 games in his [[2001\u201302 NBA season|second]] and 29 in his [[2002\u201303 NBA season|third]]. He was forced to sit out his ''entire'' fourth year with Orlando ([[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]]). Meanwhile, the Pistons, who had defeated the Magic in the [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003 Playoffs]], but ended up losing to the New Jersey Nets in the Eastern Conference Finals, won the championship the following year in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]].\n\nIn March 2003, Hill underwent a major surgical procedure in which doctors re-fractured his ankle and realigned it with his leg bone. Five days after the surgery was performed, Hill developed a 104.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (40.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) [[fever]] and [[convulsion]]s, and was rushed to a hospital. Doctors removed the splint around his ankle and discovered that Hill had contracted a potentially fatal [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection. He was hospitalized for a week and had to take [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] for six months.\n\nIn the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] Hill, though hampered by a bruised left shin that caused him to miss several games, started and played 67 games for the Magic. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week for the week between November 15\u201321, 2004. Over the season, Hill averaged 19.7 points per game on a .509 field goal percentage. Fans voted him an All-Star starter again, and he led the Eastern Conference All-Star Team to a victory over the West. In addition, at the conclusion of the season, Hill was awarded the [[Joe Dumars Trophy]] presented to the [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]] Winner.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] Hill was once again injured frequently as nagging groin injuries kept him sidelined for much of the first half of the season, limiting him to 21 games. He got a sports [[hernia]] that was caused by an uneven pressure on Hill's feet while he was running, due to concerns that he could re-aggravate the injury on his left ankle if it got too much pressure. Hill underwent surgery for the hernia and stated that he would consider retirement if he had to get another surgery.\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]] Hill returned from injuries despite numerous rumors surrounding his retirement. Hill received ankle rotation therapy from specialists in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] during the off-season and stated that he had regained much motion in his left ankle. Hill returned to the Magic lineup, starting at the [[shooting guard]] position. Despite having problems with injuries to his left knee and a [[tendon]] in his left ankle, Hill managed to play 65 games, two short of the highest number of games he played over a single season as a member of the Magic. He finished the season with averages of 14.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. This season would see Hill return to the playoffs for the first time since 2000, his first playoff appearance with the Magic. The 8th seed Magic would meet Hill's old team, the [[2006\u201307 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], in the first round. The Pistons' vast playoff experience would prevail over the inexperienced Magic, who had not seen significant post-season action for some years, and despite having some close games, the series would end with a 4\u20130 Pistons sweep, leaving Hill undecided on whether to return for the [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2007\u201308 season]] with the Magic, sign with another team, or retire.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2852728 Beset by injuries in career, Hill considers retirement], updated April 28, 2007</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2007\u20132012)===\n[[File:Grant Hill Phoenix.jpg|thumb|right|Hill with the Phoenix Suns in 2009]]\nHill became an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2007.

Hill adapted well to the Suns' up-tempo style, averaging double figures in points as a key role player for Phoenix in the early months of the 2007\u201308 season. He played in the team's first 34 games before an emergency appendectomy on January 9, 2008, sidelined him for two weeks. Despite being bothered by multiple injuries throughout the season, Hill had his first 70-game season since leaving Detroit, averaging 13.1 ppg, 5.0 rpg and 2.9 apg in the process.\n\nPlaying for the Phoenix Suns in the 2008\u20132009 season, Hill appeared in all 82 games for the first time in his career and averaged 12.0 ppg, 4.90 rpg, and 2.3 apg, scoring 27 points and 10 rebounds in the Suns' season finale.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Hill decided to re-sign with the Phoenix Suns for a 2-year deal, despite an offer from the [[2009\u201310 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] for the full mid-level exception and the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] offering Hill the bi-annual exception.<ref>Aldridge, David.

A Yoda condition places the constant portion of the expression on the left side of the conditional statement.
