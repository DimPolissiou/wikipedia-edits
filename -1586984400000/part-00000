He represented the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national football team]] seven times during his career.\n\nAn [[Arsenal F.C. Academy|Arsenal Academy]] graduate, he made one league appearance in the 1999\u20132000 campaign, before signing with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He spent six years with Cardiff, making 214 appearances in league and cup, helping them to two [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] as the club rose from the fourth to the second tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. Released by the club in 2006, he travelled to Norway to sign with [[Viking FK]], though he only played one game. In 2007, he returned to England with spells at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]. He moved to [[Football in Scotland|Scottish]] club [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in 2010 and captained the side to a second-place finish in the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] in 2011\u201312. In May 2012, he joined [[Football in Iceland|Icelandic]] club [[Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lag Reykjav\u00edkur|KR Reykjav\u00edk]]. Five months later he signed for [[Football in Malaysia|Malaysian]] club [[Sabah FA]]. He returned to England with [[AFC Wimbledon]] in July 2013, and from there was loaned out to [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] in January 2014.

He represented the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national football team]] seven times during his career.\n\nAn [[Arsenal F.C. Academy|Arsenal Academy]] graduate, he made one league appearance in the 1999\u20132000 campaign, before signing with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He spent six years with Cardiff, making 214 appearances in league and cup, helping them to two [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] as the club rose from the fourth to the second tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. Released by the club in 2006, he travelled to Norway to sign with [[Viking FK]], though he only played one game. In 2007, he returned to England with spells at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]. He moved to [[Football in Scotland|Scottish]] club [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in 2010 and captained the side to a second-place finish in the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] in 2011\u201312. In May 2012, he joined [[Football in Iceland|Icelandic]] club [[Knattspyrnuf\u00e9lag Reykjav\u00edkur|KR Reykjav\u00edk]]. Five months later he signed for [[Football in Malaysia|Malaysian]] club [[Sabah FA]]. He returned to England with [[AFC Wimbledon]] in July 2013, and from there was loaned out to [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] in January 2014.
