By 1930, the school's name had changed again to '''East Tennessee State Teacher's College, Johnson City'''. In 1943, East Tennessee State Teacher's College was expanded into a college with a range of [[liberal arts]] offerings, becoming '''East Tennessee State College'''.

Additionally, pediatric palliative care practitioners must assess both the sick child and their family's understanding of complex illness and options for care, and provide accessible, thoughtful education to address knowledge gaps and allow for informed decision making. Finally, practitioners are supporting children and families in the queries, emotional distress, and decision making that ensues from the child's illness.\n\nMany frameworks for communication have been established within the medical literature, but the field of pediatric palliative care is still in relative infancy. Communication considerations and strategies employed in a palliative setting include:\n\n* '''Developing supportive relationships with patients and families.''' An essential component of a provider's ability to provide individualized palliative care is their ability to obtain an intimate understanding of the child and family's preferences and overall character. On initial consultation, palliative care providers often focus on affirming a caring relationship with the pediatric patient and their family by first asking the child how they would describe themself and what is important to them, communicating in an age and developmentally cognizant fashion. The provider may then gather similar information from the child's caregivers. Questions practitioners may ask include 'What does the child enjoy doing? What do they most dislike doing? What does a typical day look like for the child?' Other topics potentially addressed by the palliative care provider may also include familial rituals as well as spiritual and religious beliefs, life goals for the child, and the meaning of illness within the broader context of the child and their family's life.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* '''Developing a shared understanding of the child's condition with the patient and their family.''' The establishment of shared knowledge between medical providers, patients, and families is essential when determining palliative goals of care for pediatric patients. Initially, practitioners often elicit information from the patient ''and'' child to ascertain these parties' baseline understanding of the child's situation.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garwick AW, Patterson J, Bennett FC, Blum RW | title = Breaking the news.

Through this process, families can pursue informed, shared medical decision making regarding their child's care. A framework often employed by pediatric palliative care providers is 'ask, tell, ask' where the provider asks the patient and their family for a question to identify their level of comprehension of the situation, and then subsequently supplements the family's knowledge with additional expert knowledge.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"baile\" /> This information is often conveyed without jargon or euphemism to maintain trust and ensure understanding. Providers iteratively check for comprehension of this knowledge supplementation by asking questions related to previous explanations, as information retention can be challenging when undergoing a stressful experience.<ref name=\":7\" />\n* '''Establishing meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness.''' As part of developing a shared understanding of a child's illness and character, palliative providers will assess both the child and their family's symbolic and emotional relationship to disease. As both the somatic and psychologic implications of illness can be distressing to children, palliative care practitioners look for opportunities to establish meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness by contextualizing disease within a broader framework of the child's life.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Dignity therapy : final words for final days |last=Chochinov | first = Harvey Max | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517621-6|location=Oxford|oclc=714030350}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine |last=Cassell | first = Eric J. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=1-60256-743-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}</ref> Derived from the fields of [[Harvey Chochinov|dignity therapy]] and [[William Breitbart|meaning-centered psychotherapy]], the palliative care provider may explore the following questions with the sick child and their family:\n** What gives your life meaning, worth, or purpose?\n** Where do you find strength and support?\n** What inspires you?\n** How do you like to be thought of?\n** What are you most proud of?\n** What are the particular things you would like your family to know or remember about you?\n** When was the last time you laughed really hard?\n** Are you frightened by all of this?

Do you ever think about why this happened to you?<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n* '''Assessing preferences for decision making.''' Medical decision making in a pediatric setting is unique in that it is often the child's legal guardians, not the patient, who ultimately consent for most medical treatments. Yet within a palliative care setting, it is particularly consequential to incorporate the child's preferences within the ultimate goals of care. Equally important to consider, families may vary in the level of responsibility they want in this decision making process.<ref name=\":11\" /> Their preference may range from wanting to be the child's sole decision makers, to partnering with the medical team in a shared decision making model, to advocating for full deferral of decision-making responsibility to the clinician.<ref name=\":11\" /> Palliative care providers clarify a family's preferences and support needs for medical decision making by providing context, information, and options for treatment and medical palliation.\n* '''Optimizing the environment for effective conversations around prognosis and goals of care.''' Essential to facilitating supportive, clear communication around potentially distressing topics such as prognosis and goals of care for seriously ill pediatric patients is optimizing the setting where this communication will take place and developing informed consensus among the child's caregiving team regarding goals and options for care. Often, these conversations occur within the context of family meetings, which are formal meetings between families and the child's multidisciplinary medical team. Prior to the family meeting, providers often meet to discuss the child's overall case, reasonably expected prognosis, and options for care, in addition to clarifying specific roles each provider will take on during the family meeting. During this meeting, the multidisciplinary medical team may also discuss any legal or ethical considerations related to the case. Palliative care providers often facilitate this meeting and help synthesize its outcome for children and their families. Experts in optimized communication, palliative care providers may opt to hold the family meeting in a quiet space where the providers and family can sit and address concerns during a time when all parties are not constrained. Additionally, parents' preferences regarding information exchange with the sick child present should be clarified.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Grier HE | title = The Day One Talk | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 563\u20136 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14752081 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.078 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Hilden JM, Watterson J, Moore C, Turner B, Grier HE, Weeks JC, Wolfe J | display-authors = 6 | title = Parent and physician perspectives on quality of care at the end of life in children with cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 36 | pages = 9155\u201361 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16172457 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.010 }}</ref> If the child's guardians are resistant to disclosing information in front of their child, the child's provider may explore parental concerns on the topic.

A significant role of the pediatric palliative care provider is to help support children, their families, and their caregiving teams through the emotional stress of illness. Communication strategies the palliative care provider may employ in this role are asking for permission when engaging with potentially distressing conversations, naming emotions witnessed to create opportunities to discuss complex emotional responses to illness, actively listening, and allowing for invitational silence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Back AL, Bauer-Wu SM, Rushton CH, Halifax J | title = Compassionate silence in the patient-clinician encounter: a contemplative approach | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = 1113\u20137 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19698026 | pmc = 2939848 | doi = 10.1089/jpm.2009.0175 }}</ref> The palliative care provider may iteratively assess the child and family's emotional responses and needs during challenging conversations.

In [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and many other countries all palliative care is offered free, either through the [[National Health Service]] or through charities working in partnership with the local health services. Palliative care services in the United States are paid by philanthropy, fee-for service mechanisms, or from direct hospital support while hospice care is provided as a Medicare benefit; similar hospice benefits are offered by Medicaid and most private health insurers. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB), a person signs off their Medicare Part B (acute hospital payment) and enrolls in the MHB through Medicare Part B with direct care provided by a Medicare certified hospice agency. Under terms of the MHB, the hospice agency is responsible for the care plan and may not bill the person for services. The hospice agency, together with the person's primary physician, is responsible for determining the care plan. All costs related to the terminal illness are paid from a per diem rate (~US $126/day) that the hospice agency receives from Medicare \u2013 this includes all drugs and equipment, nursing, social service, chaplain visits, and other services deemed appropriate by the hospice agency; Medicare does not pay for custodial care. People may elect to withdraw from the MHB and return to Medicare Part A and later re-enroll in hospice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Certification and training for services===\nIn most countries, hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of [[physician]]s, [[clinical pharmacy|pharmacists]], [[registered nurses|nurses]], [[nursing assistants]], [[social worker]]s, [[hospice chaplain|chaplain]]s, and caregivers.

In 2015 the UK's palliative care was ranked as the best in the world \"due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the ''[[National Health Service]]'', a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Quality of Death Index 2015: Ranking palliative care across the world|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015|access-date=8 October 2015|work=The Economist Intelligence Unit|date=6 October 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=UK end-of-life care 'best in world'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34415362|access-date=8 October 2015|work=BBC|date=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance===\nThe focus on a person's quality of life has increased greatly since the 1990s.

Additionally, pediatric palliative care practitioners must assess both the sick child and their family's understanding of complex illness and options for care, and provide accessible, thoughtful education to address knowledge gaps and allow for informed decision making. Finally, practitioners are supporting children and families in the queries, emotional distress, and decision making that ensues from the child's illness.\n\nMany frameworks for communication have been established within the medical literature, but the field of pediatric palliative care is still in relative infancy. Communication considerations and strategies employed in a palliative setting include:\n\n* '''Developing supportive relationships with patients and families.''' An essential component of a provider's ability to provide individualized palliative care is their ability to obtain an intimate understanding of the child and family's preferences and overall character. On initial consultation, palliative care providers often focus on affirming a caring relationship with the pediatric patient and their family by first asking the child how they would describe themself and what is important to them, communicating in an age and developmentally cognizant fashion. The provider may then gather similar information from the child's caregivers. Questions practitioners may ask include 'What does the child enjoy doing? What do they most dislike doing? What does a typical day look like for the child?' Other topics potentially addressed by the palliative care provider may also include familial rituals as well as spiritual and religious beliefs, life goals for the child, and the meaning of illness within the broader context of the child and their family's life.<ref name=\":6\" />\n* '''Developing a shared understanding of the child's condition with the patient and their family.''' The establishment of shared knowledge between medical providers, patients, and families is essential when determining palliative goals of care for pediatric patients. Initially, practitioners often elicit information from the patient ''and'' child to ascertain these parties' baseline understanding of the child's situation.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garwick AW, Patterson J, Bennett FC, Blum RW | title = Breaking the news.

Through this process, families can pursue informed, shared medical decision making regarding their child's care. A framework often employed by pediatric palliative care providers is 'ask, tell, ask' where the provider asks the patient and their family for a question to identify their level of comprehension of the situation, and then subsequently supplements the family's knowledge with additional expert knowledge.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"baile\" /> This information is often conveyed without jargon or euphemism to maintain trust and ensure understanding. Providers iteratively check for comprehension of this knowledge supplementation by asking questions related to previous explanations, as information retention can be challenging when undergoing a stressful experience.<ref name=\":7\" />\n* '''Establishing meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness.''' As part of developing a shared understanding of a child's illness and character, palliative providers will assess both the child and their family's symbolic and emotional relationship to disease. As both the somatic and psychologic implications of illness can be distressing to children, palliative care practitioners look for opportunities to establish meaning and dignity regarding the child's illness by contextualizing disease within a broader framework of the child's life.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Dignity therapy : final words for final days |last=Chochinov | first = Harvey Max | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517621-6|location=Oxford|oclc=714030350}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine |last=Cassell | first = Eric J. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=1-60256-743-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}</ref> Derived from the fields of [[Harvey Chochinov|dignity therapy]] and [[William Breitbart|meaning-centered psychotherapy]], the palliative care provider may explore the following questions with the sick child and their family:\n** What gives your life meaning, worth, or purpose?\n** Where do you find strength and support?\n** What inspires you?\n** How do you like to be thought of?\n** What are you most proud of?\n** What are the particular things you would like your family to know or remember about you?\n** When was the last time you laughed really hard?\n** Are you frightened by all of this?

Do you ever think about why this happened to you?<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n* '''Assessing preferences for decision making.''' Medical decision making in a pediatric setting is unique in that it is often the child's legal guardians, not the patient, who ultimately consent for most medical treatments. Yet within a palliative care setting, it is particularly consequential to incorporate the child's preferences within the ultimate goals of care. Equally important to consider, families may vary in the level of responsibility they want in this decision making process.<ref name=\":11\" /> Their preference may range from wanting to be the child's sole decision makers, to partnering with the medical team in a shared decision making model, to advocating for full deferral of decision-making responsibility to the clinician.<ref name=\":11\" /> Palliative care providers clarify a family's preferences and support needs for medical decision making by providing context, information, and options for treatment and medical palliation.\n* '''Optimizing the environment for effective conversations around prognosis and goals of care.''' Essential to facilitating supportive, clear communication around potentially distressing topics such as prognosis and goals of care for seriously ill pediatric patients is optimizing the setting where this communication will take place and developing informed consensus among the child's caregiving team regarding goals and options for care. Often, these conversations occur within the context of family meetings, which are formal meetings between families and the child's multidisciplinary medical team. Prior to the family meeting, providers often meet to discuss the child's overall case, reasonably expected prognosis, and options for care, in addition to clarifying specific roles each provider will take on during the family meeting. During this meeting, the multidisciplinary medical team may also discuss any legal or ethical considerations related to the case. Palliative care providers often facilitate this meeting and help synthesize its outcome for children and their families. Experts in optimized communication, palliative care providers may opt to hold the family meeting in a quiet space where the providers and family can sit and address concerns during a time when all parties are not constrained. Additionally, parents' preferences regarding information exchange with the sick child present should be clarified.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Grier HE | title = The Day One Talk | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 563\u20136 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14752081 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.04.078 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mack JW, Hilden JM, Watterson J, Moore C, Turner B, Grier HE, Weeks JC, Wolfe J | display-authors = 6 | title = Parent and physician perspectives on quality of care at the end of life in children with cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 36 | pages = 9155\u201361 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16172457 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.010 }}</ref> If the child's guardians are resistant to disclosing information in front of their child, the child's provider may explore parental concerns on the topic.

In [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and many other countries all palliative care is offered free, either through the [[National Health Service]] or through charities working in partnership with the local health services. Palliative care services in the United States are paid by philanthropy, fee-for service mechanisms, or from direct hospital support while hospice care is provided as a Medicare benefit; similar hospice benefits are offered by Medicaid and most private health insurers. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit (MHB), a person signs off their Medicare Part B (acute hospital payment) and enrolls in the MHB through Medicare Part B with direct care provided by a Medicare certified hospice agency. Under terms of the MHB, the hospice agency is responsible for the care plan and may not bill the person for services. The hospice agency, together with the person's primary physician, is responsible for determining the care plan. All costs related to the terminal illness are paid from a per diem rate (~US $126/day) that the hospice agency receives from Medicare \u2013 this includes all drugs and equipment, nursing, social service, chaplain visits, and other services deemed appropriate by the hospice agency; Medicare does not pay for custodial care. People may elect to withdraw from the MHB and return to Medicare Part A and later re-enroll in hospice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Certification and training for services===\nIn most countries, hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of [[physician]]s, [[clinical pharmacy|pharmacists]], [[registered nurses|nurses]], [[nursing assistants]], [[social worker]]s, [[hospice chaplain|chaplain]]s, and caregivers. In some countries, additional members of the team may include certified nursing assistants and home healthcare aides, as well as volunteers from the community (largely untrained but some being skilled medical personnel), and housekeepers.

Caregivers and people being treated often form lasting friendships over the course of care. As a consequence caregivers may find themselves under severe emotional and physical strain. Opportunities for caregiver [[respite care|respite]] are some of the services hospices provide to promote caregiver well-being. Respite may last a few hours up to several days (the latter being done by placing the primary person being cared for in a [[nursing home]] or inpatient hospice unit for several days).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thayyil J, Cherumanalil JM | title = Assessment of status of patients receiving palliative home care and services provided in a rural area-kerala, India | journal = Indian Journal of Palliative Care | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 213\u20138 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23440060 | pmc = 3573477 | doi = 10.4103/0973-1075.105693 | series = 18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the US, board certification for physicians in palliative care was through the [[American Board of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]; recently this was changed to be done through any of 11 different speciality boards through an [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]-approved procedure.

Palliative care services are most often provided in acute care hospitals organized around an interdisciplinary consultation service, with or without an acute inpatient palliative care unit. Palliative care may also be provided in the dying person's home as a \"bridge\" program between traditional US home care services and hospice care or provided in long-term care facilities.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/home-palliative-care-allows-more-patients-die-home-leading-higher-satisfaction-and-lower |title=In-Home Palliative Care Allows More Patients to Die at Home, Leading to Higher Satisfaction and Lower Acute Care Utilization and Costs |date=2013-04-03 |access-date=2013-07-09}}</ref> In contrast over 80% of hospice care in the US is provided at home with the remainder provided to people in long-term care facilities or in free standing hospice residential facilities. In the UK hospice is seen as one part of the speciality of palliative care and no differentiation is made between 'hospice' and 'palliative care'.\n\nIn the UK palliative care services offer inpatient care, home care, day care and outpatient services, and work in close partnership with mainstream services. Hospices often house a full range of services and professionals for children and adults. In 2015 the UK's palliative care was ranked as the best in the world \"due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the ''[[National Health Service]]'', a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Quality of Death Index 2015: Ranking palliative care across the world|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015|access-date=8 October 2015|work=The Economist Intelligence Unit|date=6 October 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=UK end-of-life care 'best in world'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34415362|access-date=8 October 2015|work=BBC|date=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Acceptance===\nThe focus on a person's quality of life has increased greatly since the 1990s.
