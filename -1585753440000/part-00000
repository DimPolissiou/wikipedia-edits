The Legion was part of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s dream of creating the Great Islamic State of the [[Sahel]].<ref>S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', p. 127</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nGaddafi, who had come to power in September 1969, was not only a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]], but according to G\u00e9rard Prunier an [[Arabs|Arab]] cultural [[supremacism|supremacist]].<ref>Prunier, G\u00e9rard, Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide, Cornell University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-4450-0}}</ref> His hostility to [[Chad]]'s government of [[President of Chad|President]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]] was at least partly inspired by Tombalbaye's [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] background. It also led Gaddafi to drive the [[Toubou]] of Libya, who were considered 'black', from [[Fezzan]] and across the Chadian border. Gaddafi supported the [[Sudan]]ese government of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], referring to it as an \"Arab Nationalist Revolutionary Movement\", and even offered to merge the two countries at a meeting in late 1971. Gaddafi's plans for the peaceful formation of an \"[[Arab Union]]\" were dashed when Nimeiry turned down his offer and negotiated the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] ending the [[First Sudanese Civil War]], fought with the Black, [[Animism|animist]] and Christian, [[South Sudan|South]].<ref>Prunier, pp. 43-45</ref> Gaddafi's definition of \"Arab\" was broad, including the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], as well as the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] of Chad and Sudan.<ref>Flint and de Waal, ''Darfur: A Short History of a Long War'', p. 23</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gaddafi created the Islamic Legion as a tool to unify and Arabize the region. The priority of the Legion was first Chad, and then Sudan. In [[Darfur]], a western province of Sudan, Gaddafi supported the creation of the Arab Gathering (Tajammu al-Arabi), which according to G\u00e9rard Prunier was \"a militantly racist and pan-Arabist organization which stressed the 'Arab' character of the province.\"<ref name=prunier45/> The two organizations shared members and a source of support, and the distinction between the two is often ambiguous.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==The Legion==\nThis Islamic Legion was mostly composed of immigrants from poorer [[Sahel]]ian countries,<ref name=Nolutshungu220>S. Nolutshungu, p. 220</ref> but also, according to a source, thousands of [[Pakistan]]is and some [[Bangladesh]]is who had been recruited since 1981 with the false promise of civilian jobs once in Libya.<ref>J. Thomson, ''Mercenaries, Pirates and Sovereigns'', p. 91</ref> Generally speaking, the Legion's members were immigrants who had gone to Libya with no thought of fighting wars, and had been provided with inadequate military training and had sparse commitment.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} A French journalist{{who|date=December 2012}}, speaking of the Legion's forces in Chad, observed that they were \"foreigners, Arabs or Africans, [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in spite of themselves, wretches who had come to Libya hoping for a civilian job, but found themselves signed up more or less by force to go and fight in an unknown desert.\"<ref name=Nolutshungu220/>\n\nAccording to the Military Balance published by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], the force was organized into one armored, one infantry, and one paratroop/commando brigade. It had been supplied with [[T-54]] and T-55 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and [[EE-9]] armored cars. The Legion was reported to have been committed during the fighting in Chad in 1980 and was praised by Gaddafi for its success there. However, it was believed that many of the troops who fled the Chadian attacks of March 1987 were members of the Legion.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nGaddafi dispatched legionnaires to [[Uganda]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]],<ref>J.-P. Azam et al., ''Conflict and Growth in Africa'', p. 168</ref> but the Legion was to be mostly associated with the [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict]], where already in 1980 7,000 legionnaires participated to the second battle of N'Djamena,<ref>G. Simons, ''Libya and the West'', p. 57</ref> where its fighting record was most noted for its ineptitude.<ref>J.

Prunier, ''Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide'', p. 45</ref>) ({{aka}} Islamic Pan-African Legion) was a [[Libya]]n-sponsored [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arabist]] [[paramilitary]] force, created in 1972. The Legion was part of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s dream of creating the Great Islamic State of the [[Sahel]].<ref>S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', p. 127</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nGaddafi, who had come to power in September 1969, was not only a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]], but according to G\u00e9rard Prunier an [[Arabs|Arab]] cultural [[supremacism|supremacist]].<ref>Prunier, G\u00e9rard, Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide, Cornell University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-4450-0}}</ref> His hostility to [[Chad]]'s government of [[President of Chad|President]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]] was at least partly inspired by Tombalbaye's [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] background. It also led Gaddafi to drive the [[Toubou]] of Libya, who were considered 'black', from [[Fezzan]] and across the Chadian border. Gaddafi supported the [[Sudan]]ese government of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], referring to it as an \"Arab Nationalist Revolutionary Movement\", and even offered to merge the two countries at a meeting in late 1971. Gaddafi's plans for the peaceful formation of an \"[[Arab Union]]\" were dashed when Nimeiry turned down his offer and negotiated the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] ending the [[First Sudanese Civil War]], fought with the Black, [[Animism|animist]] and Christian, [[South Sudan|South]].<ref>Prunier, pp. 43-45</ref> Gaddafi's definition of \"Arab\" was broad, including the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], as well as the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] of Chad and Sudan.<ref>Flint and de Waal, ''Darfur: A Short History of a Long War'', p. 23</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gaddafi created the Islamic Legion as a tool to unify and Arabize the region. The priority of the Legion was first Chad, and then Sudan. In [[Darfur]], a western province of Sudan, Gaddafi supported the creation of the Arab Gathering (Tajammu al-Arabi), which according to G\u00e9rard Prunier was \"a militantly racist and pan-Arabist organization which stressed the 'Arab' character of the province.\"<ref name=prunier45/> The two organizations shared members and a source of support, and the distinction between the two is often ambiguous.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==The Legion==\nThis Islamic Legion was mostly composed of immigrants from poorer [[Sahel]]ian countries,<ref name=Nolutshungu220>S. Nolutshungu, p. 220</ref> but also, according to a source, thousands of [[Pakistan]]is and some [[Bangladesh]]is who had been recruited since 1981 with the false promise of civilian jobs once in Libya.<ref>J. Thomson, ''Mercenaries, Pirates and Sovereigns'', p. 91</ref> Generally speaking, the Legion's members were immigrants who had gone to Libya with no thought of fighting wars, and had been provided with inadequate military training and had sparse commitment.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} A French journalist{{who|date=December 2012}}, speaking of the Legion's forces in Chad, observed that they were \"foreigners, Arabs or Africans, [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in spite of themselves, wretches who had come to Libya hoping for a civilian job, but found themselves signed up more or less by force to go and fight in an unknown desert.\"<ref name=Nolutshungu220/>\n\nAccording to the Military Balance published by the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], the force was organized into one armored, one infantry, and one paratroop/commando brigade. It had been supplied with [[T-54]] and T-55 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and [[EE-9]] armored cars. The Legion was reported to have been committed during the fighting in Chad in 1980 and was praised by Gaddafi for its success there. However, it was believed that many of the troops who fled the Chadian attacks of March 1987 were members of the Legion.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nGaddafi dispatched legionnaires to [[Uganda]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]],<ref>J.-P. Azam et al., ''Conflict and Growth in Africa'', p. 168</ref> but the Legion was to be mostly associated with the [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict]], where already in 1980 7,000 legionnaires participated to the second battle of N'Djamena,<ref>G. Simons, ''Libya and the West'', p. 57</ref> where its fighting record was most noted for its ineptitude.<ref>J.

Like many types of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra [[butterfat]] and [[powdered milk]]. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk. In [[Iceland]], a similar product named [[skyr]] is made.\n\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in Britain as \"Greek-style yoghurt\",<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25954228 BBC:'Greek' yoghurt Chobani firm loses legal battle, 29 January 2014]. In Britain the name \"Greek\" may only be applied to yoghurt made in Greece</ref> though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], [[Mediterranean cuisine|Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] cuisines, wherein it is often used in cooking (as it is high enough in fat content to avoid [[curdling]] at higher temperatures). Such dishes may be cooked or raw, savoury or sweet. Due to the straining process to remove excess whey, even non-fat varieties of strained yogurt are much thicker, richer, and creamier than yogurts that have not been strained. Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as [[pectin]], [[locust bean gum]], starches or [[guar gum]], listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the [[lactose]], strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.<ref name=\"mother\"/>\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion US yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP7fc6a591c5894845953163cf3e221c52.html |title=Greek yogurt on a marathon-like growth spur|work= Wall Street Journal|agency= Associated Press|date= 22 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=Neuman>{{cite news|author=Neuman, William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/business/demand-for-greek-style-helps-form-a-yogurt-cluster-in-new-york.html |title=Greek Yogurt a Boon for New York State|work=The New York Times|date= 12 January 2012}}</ref> In the US there is no legal definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\" even though it is not necessarily strained yogurt.<ref name=theKitchn>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/greek-yogurt-wars-high-tech-shortcuts-vs-purists-174420 |title=Greek Yogurt Wars: The High-Tech Shortcuts vs. The Purists|website=theKitchn|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Variations by area==\n===Asia===\n====Central Asia====\nIn the cuisines of many [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples (e.g. in [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]], [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]], [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], and other [[Central Asian cuisine]]s), a type of strained yogurt called ''chak(k)a''<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Meyer\n | first = Arthur L.\n | authorlink =\n | author2=Jon M.

It is usually used for making dips served with dates, or served as a side dish. It is also dried and preserved for winter use.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Middle East====\nStrained yogurt is known as ''labneh'' (''labna'', ''labni'', ''lebni'', or ''labani''; Arabic: \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0629) in the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under [[olive oil]]. Labneh is a popular [[mezze]] dish and [[sandwich]] ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from [[cow's milk]] has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of [[olive oil]] topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nIn [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]],  [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">Debra Kamin. [http://www.haaretz.com/travel-in-israel/tourist-tip-of-the-day/tourist-tip-242-labneh.premium-1.525323 Tourist tip #242:Labheh]. [[Haaretz]]</ref> It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to [[hummus]], spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend [[za'atar]].\n\n[[Bedouin]] also produce a dry, hard labneh (''labaneh malboudeh'', similar to Central Asian [[Kashk|qurut]]) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with [[khubz]] (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nLabneh is the main ingredient in [[jameed]], which is in turn used in [[mansaf]], the national dish of [[Jordan]].\n\n''Labaneh bil zayit'', \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or arish, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634}}) is a type of cheese that originated in [[Egypt]].

In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free milk.

Since the straining process removes the whey, or fluid, from the milk solids, it requires substantially more plain yogurt to produce a cup of strained yogurt, so the cost to make it is increased accordingly. Thickeners, such as [[pectin]], [[locust bean gum]], starches or [[guar gum]], listed in the ingredients indicate straining was not the method used to consolidate the milk solids. Marketing of Greek or Greek-style yogurt in the United States allows the use of more thickeners instead of straining, so there is little difference between the yogurt of years prior to the introduction of strained yogurt other than an increase of thickeners, even though the price is now higher for the original, unstrained products. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the [[lactose]], strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.<ref name=\"mother\"/>\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion US yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP7fc6a591c5894845953163cf3e221c52.html |title=Greek yogurt on a marathon-like growth spur|work= Wall Street Journal|agency= Associated Press|date= 22 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=Neuman>{{cite news|author=Neuman, William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/business/demand-for-greek-style-helps-form-a-yogurt-cluster-in-new-york.html |title=Greek Yogurt a Boon for New York State|work=The New York Times|date= 12 January 2012}}</ref> In the US there is no legal definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\" even though it is not necessarily strained yogurt.<ref name=theKitchn>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/greek-yogurt-wars-high-tech-shortcuts-vs-purists-174420 |title=Greek Yogurt Wars: The High-Tech Shortcuts vs. The Purists|website=theKitchn|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Variations by area==\n===Asia===\n====Central Asia====\nIn the cuisines of many [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples (e.g. in [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]], [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]], [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], and other [[Central Asian cuisine]]s), a type of strained yogurt called ''chak(k)a''<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Meyer\n | first = Arthur L.\n | authorlink =\n | author2=Jon M.

It is usually used for making dips served with dates, or served as a side dish. It is also dried and preserved for winter use.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Middle East====\nStrained yogurt is known as ''labneh'' (''labna'', ''labni'', ''lebni'', or ''labani''; Arabic: \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0629) in the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Besides being used fresh, labneh is also dried then formed into balls, sometimes covered with herbs or spices, and stored under [[olive oil]]. Labneh is a popular [[mezze]] dish and [[sandwich]] ingredient. A common sandwich in the Middle East is one of labneh, mint, thyme, and olive on pita bread. The flavour depends largely on the sort of milk used: labneh from [[cow's milk]] has a rather mild flavour. Also the quality of [[olive oil]] topping influences the taste of labneh. Milk from camels and other animals is used in labneh production in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.\n\nIn [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]],  [[Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]], labneh is made by straining the liquid out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour cream or heavy strained yogurt and is a common breakfast dip.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">Debra Kamin.

[[Haaretz]]</ref> It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to [[hummus]], spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend [[za'atar]].\n\n[[Bedouin]] also produce a dry, hard labneh (''labaneh malboudeh'', similar to Central Asian [[Kashk|qurut]]) that can be stored. Strained labneh is pressed in cheese cloth between two heavy stones and later sun dried. This dry labneh is often eaten with [[khubz]] (Arabic bread), in which both khubz and labneh are mixed with water, animal fat, and salt, and rolled into balls.\n\nLabneh is the main ingredient in [[jameed]], which is in turn used in [[mansaf]], the national dish of [[Jordan]].\n\n''Labaneh bil zayit'', \"labaneh in oil\", consists of small balls of dry labneh kept under oil, where it can be preserved for over a year. As it ages it turns more sour.\n\nIn Egypt, it is eaten with savoury accompaniments such as olives and oil, and also with a sweetener such as honey, as a snack or breakfast food. Areesh cheese (or arish, {{lang-ar|\u062c\u0628\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0634}}) is a type of cheese that originated in [[Egypt]].

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]].

In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

reserved, and that, frankly, triggered a lot of my own insecurities and fears,\" he said.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice.

The decision stated that simply creating color-keyed characters based on emotions was not enough to be copyrighted, but instead would required these characters to carry similar characterization elements, as they had previously determined in ''DC Comics v.
