The band consists of cousins [[James Dean Bradfield]] (lead vocals, lead guitar), and [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] (drums, percussion, soundscapes), plus [[Nicky Wire]] (bass guitar, lyrics). They are often colloquially known as \"the Manics\". They form a key part of the 1990s [[Cool Cymru]] movement.\n\nFollowing the release of their debut single \"[[Suicide Alley]]\", the band was joined by [[Richey Edwards]] as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band's early albums were in a [[Punk rock|punk]] vein, eventually broadening to a greater [[alternative rock]] sound, whilst retaining a [[left-wing politics|leftist]] political outlook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.richeyedwards.net/28nov08independent.html |title=Final Farewell for a Cult Hero |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> Their early combination of androgynous [[glam rock|glam]] imagery and lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" has gained them a loyal following and [[Cult following|cult]] status.<ref name=\"Price\"/>\n\nWith their debut album, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'', the Manic Street Preachers proclaimed it would be the \"greatest rock album ever\",<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5073-lipstick-traces-a-secret-history-of-manic-street-preachers/ |title=Manic Street Preachers: ''Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers''|last=Tangari |first=Joe |date=23 February 2004 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> as well as hoping to sell \"sixteen million copies\" around the world, after which they would split up.<ref name=\"Price\"/> Despite (or due to) the album's failure to meet this level of success, the band carried on with their career.

The ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' gave \"Suicide Alley\" an enthusiastic review, citing a press release by Richey Edwards: \"We are as far away from anything in the '80s as possible.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic2\"/>\n\nAfter the release of \"Suicide Alley,\" Edwards joined the band on rhythm guitar and contributed to lyrics alongside Wire. Edwards also designed record sleeves and artwork, and drove the band to and from gigs.<ref name=\"Price\"/>\n\nIn 1990 the Manic Street Preachers signed a deal with label [[Damaged Goods Records]] for one [[Extended play|EP]]. The four-track ''[[New Art Riot E.P.]]'' attracted as much media interest for its attacks on fellow musicians as for the actual music.<ref name=\"Price\"/> With the help of Hall or Nothing management, the Manics signed to [[Independent record label|indie]] label [[Heavenly Records]]. The band recorded their first single for the label, entitled \"[[Motown Junk]]\".\n\nTheir next single, \"[[You Love Us (Heavenly Version)|You Love Us]]\", sampled [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s \"[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]\" as well as [[Iggy Pop]]. The video featured Nicky Wire in [[Cross dressing|drag]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] and contained visual references to the film ''[[Betty Blue]]'' and to [[Aleister Crowley]]. In an interview with then-''NME'' journalist [[Steve Lamacq]], Edwards carved the phrase \"4REAL\" into his arm with a razor blade to prove their sincerity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nme.com/photos/richey-edwards-remembered/121944/11/3 |title= Pictures of Richey Edwards Remembered \u2013 Photos \u2013 nme.com |website= [[NME]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013}}</ref> He was taken to hospital and received seventeen stitches.<ref name=\"Price\"/> ''NME'' subsequently ran a full page story on the incident, including a phone interview with Richey on his motivations for doing it.

It was released to mixed reviews but still performed well, reaching number eight in the UK album chart. The album presents a different sound from their debut album, not only in terms of lyrics but in sound, the band privileged long guitar riffs, and the drums themselves feel more present and loud in the final mix of the album. This sound would be abandoned in their next album and as for the nature of the lyrics they also changed, with Edwards and Wire eschewing their political fire for introspective [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]].<ref name=\"Price 1999\">Price (1999).</ref> According to [[AllMusic]], the album \"takes the [[hard rock]] inclinations of ''Generation Terrorists'' to an extreme.\"<ref name=\"Erlewine\"/>\n\nThe band also stated that the choice to work with [[Dave Eringa]] again was important for this album: \"We finished work in November and then just went straight into a demo studio and we came out about four weeks later with the album all finished. We were all happy with all the songs, we knew what they wanted to sound like, so we didn't want to use a mainstream producer because they've got their own sound and vision of what a record should be like. So we just phoned Dave up and said 'Look, come down, let's see how this works out', and everyone loved what we were doing, so we decided to stay with him.\"<ref name=\"Price 1999\"/>\n\nThe band have described ''Gold Against the Soul'' as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist [[James Dean Bradfield]] has said \"All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing.

Lyrically the themes were different from their previous effort, instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as \"4st 7lb\", Wire's predilection for historical and political themes dominates, like the No. 2 hit single \"[[A Design for Life]]\". The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the mysterious disappearance of figurehead [[Richey Edwards]] the previous year and was used as the opening track on ''[[Forever Delayed]]'', the band's greatest hits album released in November 2002.\n\nMuch later on, interviewed in 2014 by ''[[NME]]'' for their \"Song Stories\" video series, singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalled that the lyric had been a fusion of two sets of lyrics-\"Design for Life\" and \"Pure Motive\"-sent to him from Wales by bassist Nicky Wire, while he was living in [[Shepherd's Bush]]. The music was written \"in about ten minutes\" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result. The song was credited with having \"rescued the band\" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as \"a bolt of light from a severely dark place\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T4UgrW7tLw |title=How Writing 'A Design For Life' Saved Manic Street Preachers \u2013 Interview |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> The album was shortlisted for the 1996 [[Mercury Prize]] award for best album, and won the band two [[Brit Awards]] for Best British Band and Best British Album,<ref name=\"brits.co.uk\"/> as well as yielding the hit singles \"[[Australia (Manic Street Preachers song)|Australia]]\", \"[[Everything Must Go (song)|Everything Must Go]]\" and \"[[Kevin Carter (song)|Kevin Carter]]\".\n\nSubjects tackled on the album include the tragic life of the photographer [[Kevin Carter]], on the track of the same name, [[Willem de Kooning]] and the maltreatment of animals in captivity on \"Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky\" (which is a quote from the film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''). The latter track, with lyrics by Edwards, can also be interpreted as an exploration of his mental state before his disappearance; the line \"Here chewing your tail is joy\" for instance may be as much about Richey's [[self-harm]] as it is the tormented self-injury of zoo animals.

The only recurring criticism of ''Lipstick Traces'' was the exclusion of the fan favourite \"Patrick Bateman\", from the \"[[La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)]]\" single.

The album was more introspective and more focused on the past, Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: \"The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared. Not ugly dreams, but nagging things. Until we wrote '[[A Design for Life|Design for Life]]', it was six months of misery.

The sound of the album, which Nicky referred to as his \"nihilistic anti-everything album\", was inspired by, among others, [[Neu!]], the [[Plastic Ono Band]], [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], [[the Modern Lovers]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Lou Reed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickyssecretsociety.com/ss/lists.php |title=Nicky Wire\u2013 Official Site |website=nickyssecretsociety.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115959/http://www.nickyssecretsociety.com/ss/lists.php |archivedate=14 January 2009}}</ref> Only one official single was released, \"[[I Killed the Zeitgeist|Break My Heart Slowly]]\", which charted at No.&nbsp;74.

The sound of the album was inspired by, among others, [[Jeff Beck]], [[Badfinger]], [[Simple Minds]] and [[McCarthy (band)|McCarthy]]. Two singles were released: \"[[That's No Way to Tell a Lie]]\" (No.&nbsp;18) in July, which was also the background music to the [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]]'s '[[BBC Goal of the Month|Goal of the Month]]' competition,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/4797885.stm | title=Ask us about: Music details | work=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=14 June 2007 | author=BBC Staff | date=12 June 2007}}</ref> and then \"[[An English Gentleman]]\" (No.&nbsp;31) in September. The latter is in remembrance of the first Manics manager Philip Hall, who died from cancer in 1993<ref name=quiet/> and to whom ''The Holy Bible'' had been dedicated. The initial pressings of the red 7\" single were actually made with black vinyl, some of which were sent out to distributors by mistake. James toured the album with a band that included Wayne Murray, who would subsequently play second guitar for Manics live performances. James's solo gigs featured covers of [[the Clash]] songs \"[[Clampdown]]\" and \"The Card Cheat\", both from the album ''[[London Calling]]''.\n\nIn a later interview, when the band were collectively asked what they had learned from making a solo album, Sean Moore dryly quipped \"Not to do one\".<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\n== Collaborations and covers ==\n[[File:Manicstreetpreachersatbrixton.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Manic Street Preachers performing live in Brixton O2 Academy, 2014]]\n\nThe band released a split single in 1992 with [[the Fatima Mansions]], a rock cover of \"[[Suicide Is Painless]]\", which became their first UK Top 10 hit.<ref name=\"Price\"/> They have recorded many cover versions of songs by other artists, primarily as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] for their own singles.

That same year, James Dean Bradfield and [[Dave Eringa]] produced [[Northern Uproar]]'s first single, \"[[Rollercoaster/Rough Boys]]\". The [[808 State]] song \"Lopez\" (1997) features lyrics by Wire and vocals by Bradfield.<ref name=\"Price\"/> It is featured on their greatest hits album, ''[[808:88:98]]''. [[Kylie Minogue]]'s sixth album, ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997), features two songs co-written and produced by the Manics: \"[[Some Kind of Bliss]]\" (Bradfield, Minogue and Sean Moore) and \"I Don't Need Anyone\" (Bradfield, Jones and Minogue) were produced by Bradfield and Dave Eringa.<ref name=\"Price\"/> Bradfield provided backing vocals, bass guitar and production for the [[Massive Attack]] song \"[[Inertia Creeps]]\" (1998), which features on their successful third album, ''[[Mezzanine (album)|Mezzanine]]''.<ref name=\"Price\"/> [[Patrick Jones]]'s album of poetry set to music, ''[[Patrick Jones#Commemoration and Amnesia|Commemoration and Amnesia]]'' (1999), features two songs with music written by Bradfield: the title track and \"The Guerilla Tapestry\". Bradfield plays guitar on both songs. Furthermore, the track \"Hiraeth\" features a section called \"Spoken Word\", in which Nicky Wire talks about Welsh identity.<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\nIn February 2006, the band contributed a cover version of \"The Instrumental\" to the album ''[[Still Unravished|Still Unravished: A Tribute to the June Brides]]''.<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\nIn February 2008, the Manics covered [[Rihanna]]'s hit pop song \"[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]\". Their version appeared on a CD titled ''[[NME Awards 2008 (album)|NME Awards 2008]]'' given away free with a special souvenir box-set issue of ''[[NME]]'' magazine, which went on sale 27 February.

The band consists of cousins [[James Dean Bradfield]] (lead vocals, lead guitar), and [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] (drums, percussion, soundscapes), plus [[Nicky Wire]] (bass guitar, lyrics). They are often colloquially known as \"the Manics\". They form a key part of the 1990s [[Cool Cymru]] movement.\n\nFollowing the release of their debut single \"[[Suicide Alley]]\", the band was joined by [[Richey Edwards]] as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band's early albums were in a [[Punk rock|punk]] vein, eventually broadening to a greater [[alternative rock]] sound, whilst retaining a [[left-wing politics|leftist]] political outlook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.richeyedwards.net/28nov08independent.html |title=Final Farewell for a Cult Hero |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> Their early combination of androgynous [[glam rock|glam]] imagery and lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" has gained them a loyal following and [[Cult following|cult]] status.<ref name=\"Price\"/>\n\nWith their debut album, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'', the Manic Street Preachers proclaimed it would be the \"greatest rock album ever\",<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5073-lipstick-traces-a-secret-history-of-manic-street-preachers/ |title=Manic Street Preachers: ''Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers''|last=Tangari |first=Joe |date=23 February 2004 |website=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref> as well as hoping to sell \"sixteen million copies\" around the world, after which they would split up.<ref name=\"Price\"/> Despite (or due to) the album's failure to meet this level of success, the band carried on with their career.

The ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' gave \"Suicide Alley\" an enthusiastic review, citing a press release by Richey Edwards: \"We are as far away from anything in the '80s as possible.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic2\"/>\n\nAfter the release of \"Suicide Alley,\" Edwards joined the band on rhythm guitar and contributed to lyrics alongside Wire. Edwards also designed record sleeves and artwork, and drove the band to and from gigs.<ref name=\"Price\"/>\n\nIn 1990 the Manic Street Preachers signed a deal with label [[Damaged Goods Records]] for one [[Extended play|EP]]. The four-track ''[[New Art Riot E.P.]]'' attracted as much media interest for its attacks on fellow musicians as for the actual music.<ref name=\"Price\"/> With the help of Hall or Nothing management, the Manics signed to [[Independent record label|indie]] label [[Heavenly Records]]. The band recorded their first single for the label, entitled \"[[Motown Junk]]\".\n\nTheir next single, \"[[You Love Us (Heavenly Version)|You Love Us]]\", sampled [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s \"[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]\" as well as [[Iggy Pop]]. The video featured Nicky Wire in [[Cross dressing|drag]] as [[Marilyn Monroe]] and contained visual references to the film ''[[Betty Blue]]'' and to [[Aleister Crowley]].

The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the mysterious disappearance of figurehead [[Richey Edwards]] the previous year and was used as the opening track on ''[[Forever Delayed]]'', the band's greatest hits album released in November 2002.\n\nMuch later on, interviewed in 2014 by ''[[NME]]'' for their \"Song Stories\" video series, singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalled that the lyric had been a fusion of two sets of lyrics-\"Design for Life\" and \"Pure Motive\"-sent to him from Wales by bassist Nicky Wire, while he was living in [[Shepherd's Bush]]. The music was written \"in about ten minutes\" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result.

The latter track, with lyrics by Edwards, can also be interpreted as an exploration of his mental state before his disappearance; the line \"Here chewing your tail is joy\" for instance may be as much about Richey's [[self-harm]] as it is the tormented self-injury of zoo animals.

The album received a far more positive reception from fans than the ''[[Forever Delayed]]'' greatest hits album, which was heavily criticised for favouring the band's more commercially successful singles. The only recurring criticism of ''Lipstick Traces'' was the exclusion of the fan favourite \"Patrick Bateman\", from the \"[[La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)]]\" single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album.\"<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\n=== ''Lifeblood'' to ''Journal for Plague Lovers'' (2004\u20132009) ===\nThe band's seventh studio album, ''[[Lifeblood (album)|Lifeblood]]'', was released on 1 November 2004 and reached No.&nbsp;13 on the UK album chart. Critical response to the album was mixed. The album was more introspective and more focused on the past, Wire talked about the ghosts that haunted this record and stated that the record was a retrospective: \"The main themes are death and solitude and ghosts. Being haunted by history and being haunted by your own past. Sleep is beautiful for me. I hate dreaming because it ruins ten hours of bliss. I had a lot of bad dreams when Richey first disappeared. Not ugly dreams, but nagging things. Until we wrote '[[A Design for Life|Design for Life]]', it was six months of misery.

In addition, a promotional album sampler had been sent out to the press and certain other people which included \"I Killed the Zeitgeist\", \"Goodbye Suicide\", \"Sehnsucht\", and \"Everything Fades\".\n\nThe album was officially released in September 2006. It charted at No.&nbsp;130 in the UK. The sound of the album, which Nicky referred to as his \"nihilistic anti-everything album\", was inspired by, among others, [[Neu!]], the [[Plastic Ono Band]], [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], [[the Modern Lovers]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Lou Reed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickyssecretsociety.com/ss/lists.php |title=Nicky Wire\u2013 Official Site |website=nickyssecretsociety.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114115959/http://www.nickyssecretsociety.com/ss/lists.php |archivedate=14 January 2009}}</ref> Only one official single was released, \"[[I Killed the Zeitgeist|Break My Heart Slowly]]\", which charted at No.&nbsp;74.

Two singles were released: \"[[That's No Way to Tell a Lie]]\" (No.&nbsp;18) in July, which was also the background music to the [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]]'s '[[BBC Goal of the Month|Goal of the Month]]' competition,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/4797885.stm | title=Ask us about: Music details | work=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=14 June 2007 | author=BBC Staff | date=12 June 2007}}</ref> and then \"[[An English Gentleman]]\" (No.&nbsp;31) in September. The latter is in remembrance of the first Manics manager Philip Hall, who died from cancer in 1993<ref name=quiet/> and to whom ''The Holy Bible'' had been dedicated. The initial pressings of the red 7\" single were actually made with black vinyl, some of which were sent out to distributors by mistake. James toured the album with a band that included Wayne Murray, who would subsequently play second guitar for Manics live performances. James's solo gigs featured covers of [[the Clash]] songs \"[[Clampdown]]\" and \"The Card Cheat\", both from the album ''[[London Calling]]''.\n\nIn a later interview, when the band were collectively asked what they had learned from making a solo album, Sean Moore dryly quipped \"Not to do one\".<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\n== Collaborations and covers ==\n[[File:Manicstreetpreachersatbrixton.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Manic Street Preachers performing live in Brixton O2 Academy, 2014]]\n\nThe band released a split single in 1992 with [[the Fatima Mansions]], a rock cover of \"[[Suicide Is Painless]]\", which became their first UK Top 10 hit.<ref name=\"Price\"/> They have recorded many cover versions of songs by other artists, primarily as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] for their own singles.

That same year, James Dean Bradfield and [[Dave Eringa]] produced [[Northern Uproar]]'s first single, \"[[Rollercoaster/Rough Boys]]\". The [[808 State]] song \"Lopez\" (1997) features lyrics by Wire and vocals by Bradfield.<ref name=\"Price\"/> It is featured on their greatest hits album, ''[[808:88:98]]''.

Bradfield plays guitar on both songs. Furthermore, the track \"Hiraeth\" features a section called \"Spoken Word\", in which Nicky Wire talks about Welsh identity.<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\nIn February 2006, the band contributed a cover version of \"The Instrumental\" to the album ''[[Still Unravished|Still Unravished: A Tribute to the June Brides]]''.<ref name=\"Manic Street Preachers\"/>\n\nIn February 2008, the Manics covered [[Rihanna]]'s hit pop song \"[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]\".

By the mid-1990s, SAP followed the trend from [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computing to [[client-server architecture|client/server architectures]]. The development of SAP's internet strategy with mySAP.com redesigned the concept of business processes (integration via Internet).<ref name=\"saphistory\" /> As a result, R/3 was replaced with the introduction of SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) 5.0 in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cipherbsc.com/sap-ecc-modules/|title=SAP ECC Modules - Cipher Business Solutions|last=Solutions|first=Cipher Business|publisher=Cipher Business Solutions|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Architectural changes were also made to support an enterprise service architecture to transition customers to a services-oriented architecture.

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.
