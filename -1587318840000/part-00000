It was the 65th of the numbered series of merchant convoy] run by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from [[Halifax Harbour|Halifax]] to [[Liverpool]]. The convoy was attacked by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-boat]]s and aircraft, losing eight of its 51 ships sunk and a further three damaged. One U-boat was damaged.\n\n==Background==\nHX 65 formed of three sections sailing from the Americas, and was to divide into two sections for the landfall in the [[United Kingdom]]. \nThe main body, of 13 ships,  departed Halifax on 12 August 1940;<ref>Hague, p.126</ref> with ships gathered from the US eastern seaboard; it was led by [[convoy commodore]] [[Vice Admiral|V.Adm.]] BG Washington in the steamship ''Harpalyce''. It was accompanied by its ocean escort, the [[Armed Merchant Cruiser]] ''Voltaire'', and a local escort of two [[Royal Canadian Navy|RCN]] warships. \nIt was joined on 14 August by 16 ships from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], on [[Cape Breton Island]], also with a local escort. These had gathered from ports on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\nOn 16 August the convoy was joined by BHX 65, 22 ships from the [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]], that had gathered at [[Bermuda]], departing there on 11 August escorted by the AMC ''Montclare''.<ref>Hague, Arnold; BHX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref> \n\nRanged against HX 65 were U-boats of the [[Kreigsmarine|German Navy's]] [[1st U-boat Flotilla|1st]], [[2nd U-boat Flotilla|2nd]] and [[7th U-boat Flotilla|7th]] U-boat Flotillas, operating from [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\n==Action==\nOn 22 August HX 65\u2019s Western Approaches escort began to arrive; the destroyer {{HMCS|Skeena|D59|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Godetia|K72|2}} left the outbound OA 201, arriving later that day. On 24 August the destroyer {{HMS|Westcott|D47|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Gladiolus|K34|2}} arrived from OB 201.<ref>Hague lists ''Gladiolus'' as escort for OB 201 with ''Westcott'', but not joining HX 65. Uboat.net has ''Gladiolus'' joining HX 65 with ''Westcott'' on 24th, but from OA 201.</ref>  \n\nOn the morning of 24 August  tanker ''La Brea'' (one of two ships that had dropped out of HX 65 5 days earlier) was sighted by {{GS|U-48|1939|2}} in the North West Approaches WNW of [[Rockall]]. She was attacked and sunk, leaving two boats of survivors in bad weather and rough seas. They made landfall in the [[Hebrides]] over the next two days.<ref>Blair p181</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65 HX 65] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref> \n\nOn the evening of 24 August the convoy divided, one section (referred to in some sources as HX 65A) of 20 ships bound for [[Methil]] on Scotland\u2019s east coast via [[Cape Wrath]] and the north of Scotland, and a second section (HX 65 B) of 22 ships bound for Liverpool.\n\nThe Methil section, led by ''Harpalyce'' and  escorted by ''Skeena'' and ''Godetia'' was found by ''U-48'', which  attacked during the night of 24/25 August, sinking 2 ships, ''Empire Merlin'' and ''Athelcrest''. She was counter attacked by ''Godetia'' but escaped without damage.\nLater, on the morning of 25 August the convoy was sighted twice more, by {{GS|U-28|1936|2}} and {{GS|U-32|1937|2}}, but the convoy had been joined by a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] from [[Coastal Command]], and both submerged on sighting the aircraft. ''U-32'' made a perfunctory attack, which failed.\nThat evening the convoy was found again, by {{GS|U-124|1940|2}}, and attacked just before midnight. ''U-124'' fired four torpedoes and claimed four ships sunk; the actual success was two ships sunk (''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'') and another (''[[SS Stakesby (1930)|Stakesby]]'') damaged. ''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'' went down quickly with heavy loss of life. ''Stakesby'' was abandoned, but was later salvaged by the tug ''[[HMT Thames (1938)|Thames]]'' and repaired. ''U-124'' was counterattacked by ''Godetia'' and damaged when she ran onto a rock. After the corvette had left, ''U-124'' was unable to continue convoy operations relegated to weather reporting.<ref>Blair p181-182</ref> \nLater that day the convoy was reinforced by {{HMS|Jaguar|F34|2}} and {{HMS|Javelin|F61|2}}, two destroyers from [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65A  HX 65A] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\nOn the evening of 26 August  the convoy came under air attack near [[Kinnaird Head]] by ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft from occupied Norway; eight [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]]s of KG 30 based at [[Aalborg]]. four ships were hit; one was sunk and three damaged. ''Nellie'' and ''City of Hankow'' made port safely, but ''Cape York'' sank under tow on the following day. Later on the night of 26/27 August a second air attack by four [[Heinkel He 115|He 115]] torpedo bombers of KuFlGr 506, based in  [[Stavanger]], hit ''Remuera'', which sank. The remaining 16 ships arrived at safely at  Methil on 27th.<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 25 August the Liverpool section, led by V.Adm. Leir in ''Manchester Merchant'' and escorted by ''Westcott'', was found by {{GS|U-57|1938|2}} which gave chase. Several tankers had fallen out of the convoy, to be chivvied by the escort, and one of these, ''Pecten'', was torpedoed by ''U-57''. The escort counter-attacked, but ''U-57'' escaped. This section was also reinforced on 26 August, by the sloop {{HMS|Lowestoft|L59|2}}. No further attacks developed and the 21 ships arrived without further incident at Liverpool on 27 August.<ref>Blair p184</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65B HX 65B] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\n\n==Forces involved==\n===Allied forces===\n====Merchant ships====\nConvoy information is from Arnold Hague's Convoyweb<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.convoyweb.org.uk/HX/index.html|title=Convoy HX.65|publisher=Arnold Hague Convoy Database|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Merchant ships\n|-\n!

It was the 65th of the numbered series of of merchant [[convoy]]s run by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from [[Halifax Harbour|Halifax]] to [[Liverpool]]. The convoy was attacked by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-boat]]s and aircraft, losing eight of its 51 ships sunk and a further three damaged. One U-boat was damaged.\n\n==Background==\nHX 65 formed of three sections sailing from the Americas, and was to divide into two sections for the landfall in the [[United Kingdom]]. \nThe main body, of 13 ships,  departed Halifax on 12 August 1940;<ref>Hague, p.126</ref> with ships gathered from the US eastern seaboard; it was led by [[convoy commodore]] [[Vice Admiral|V.Adm.]] BG Washington in the steamship ''Harpalyce''. It was accompanied by its ocean escort, the [[Armed Merchant Cruiser]] ''Voltaire'', and a local escort of two [[Royal Canadian Navy|RCN]] warships. \nIt was joined on 14 August by 16 ships from [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], on [[Cape Breton Island]], also with a local escort. These had gathered from ports on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St Lawrence]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\nOn 16 August the convoy was joined by BHX 65, 22 ships from the [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]], that had gathered at [[Bermuda]], departing there on 11 August escorted by the AMC ''Montclare''.<ref>Hague, Arnold; BHX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref> \n\nRanged against HX 65 were U-boats of the [[Kreigsmarine|German Navy's]] [[1st U-boat Flotilla|1st]], [[2nd U-boat Flotilla|2nd]] and [[7th U-boat Flotilla|7th]] U-boat Flotillas, operating from [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]].\n\n==Action==\nOn 22 August HX 65\u2019s Western Approaches escort began to arrive; the destroyer {{HMCS|Skeena|D59|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Godetia|K72|2}} left the outbound OA 201, arriving later that day. On 24 August the destroyer {{HMS|Westcott|D47|2}} and the corvette {{HMS|Gladiolus|K34|2}} arrived from OB 201.<ref>Hague lists ''Gladiolus'' as escort for OB 201 with ''Westcott'', but not joining HX 65. Uboat.net has ''Gladiolus'' joining HX 65 with ''Westcott'' on 24th, but from OA 201.</ref>  \n\nOn the morning of 24 August  tanker ''La Brea'' (one of two ships that had dropped out of HX 65 5 days earlier) was sighted by {{GS|U-48|1939|2}} in the North West Approaches WNW of [[Rockall]]. She was attacked and sunk, leaving two boats of survivors in bad weather and rough seas. They made landfall in the [[Hebrides]] over the next two days.<ref>Blair p181</ref><ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65 HX 65] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref> \n\nOn the evening of 24 August the convoy divided, one section (referred to in some sources as HX 65A) of 20 ships bound for [[Methil]] on Scotland\u2019s east coast via [[Cape Wrath]] and the north of Scotland, and a second section (HX 65 B) of 22 ships bound for Liverpool.\n\nThe Methil section, led by ''Harpalyce'' and  escorted by ''Skeena'' and ''Godetia'' was found by ''U-48'', which  attacked during the night of 24/25 August, sinking 2 ships, ''Empire Merlin'' and ''Athelcrest''. She was counter attacked by ''Godetia'' but escaped without damage.\nLater, on the morning of 25 August the convoy was sighted twice more, by {{GS|U-28|1936|2}} and {{GS|U-32|1937|2}}, but the convoy had been joined by a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] from [[Coastal Command]], and both submerged on sighting the aircraft. ''U-32'' made a perfunctory attack, which failed.\nThat evening the convoy was found again, by {{GS|U-124|1940|2}}, and attacked just before midnight. ''U-124'' fired four torpedoes and claimed four ships sunk; the actual success was two ships sunk (''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'') and another (''[[SS Stakesby (1930)|Stakesby]]'') damaged. ''Harpalyce'' and ''Fircrest'' went down quickly with heavy loss of life. ''Stakesby'' was abandoned, but was later salvaged by the tug ''[[HMT Thames (1938)|Thames]]'' and repaired. ''U-124'' was counterattacked by ''Godetia'' and damaged when she ran onto a rock. After the corvette had left, ''U-124'' was unable to continue convoy operations relegated to weather reporting.<ref>Blair p181-182</ref> \nLater that day the convoy was reinforced by {{HMS|Jaguar|F34|2}} and {{HMS|Javelin|F61|2}}, two destroyers from [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>[https://www.uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=HX-65A  HX 65A] at uboat.net; retrieved 19 April 2020</ref>\nOn the evening of 26 August  the convoy came under air attack near [[Kinnaird Head]] by ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft from occupied Norway; eight [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]]s of KG 30 based at [[Aalborg]]. four ships were hit; one was sunk and three damaged. ''Nellie'' and ''City of Hankow'' made port safely, but ''Cape York'' sank under tow on the following day. Later on the night of 26/27 August a second air attack by four [[Heinkel He 115|He 115]] torpedo bombers of KuFlGr 506, based in  [[Stavanger]], hit ''Remuera'', which sank. The remaining 16 ships arrived at safely at  Methil on 27th.<ref>Hague, Arnold; HX 65 at convoyweb.org.uk</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 25 August the Liverpool section, led by V.Adm. Leir in ''Manchester Merchant'' and escorted by ''Westcott'', was found by {{GS|U-57|1938|2}} which gave chase. Several tankers had fallen out of the convoy, to be chivvied by the escort, and one of these, ''Pecten'', was torpedoed by ''U-57''. The escort counter-attacked, but ''U-57'' escaped.

The final plan of the circuit was released on September 1, 2010, showing a design inspired by the European tradition of sculpting the circuit to the contours of the land.

They descend the hill to navigate a series of fast sweepers modeled on Silverstone's Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel complex and through a blind corner at Turn 10, taking them to the far end of the circuit and a hairpin at Turn 11. The drivers then follow a {{convert|0.62|mi|km|adj=on}} straight back towards the pit and paddock area before entering the final sector of the lap and weaving through a series of corners modeled on Hockenheim's stadium section.

COTA will debut on the IndyCar Series schedule on Sunday, March 24. It will serve as the second race of the 2019 campaign. The addition of COTA at the end of March fills the large gap between the first and second races that has existed that past couple of years. Often it seemed as if the some of the momentum built by the series at the season-opener in St. Petersburg was lost by the time Indy cars got back on track a month later. Now with COTA in the fold for late-March, there will only be one off week between the season-opener at the second race of the season. This will be the first time since 2014 that 2 tracks in Texas will be on the IndyCar series calendar.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Circuit of the Americas, April 22, 2018 SkySat (cropped2).jpg|thumb|left|The Circuit of the Americas facilities in 2018]]\n===Racetrack===\n[[File:Main straight at COTA.jpg|thumb|A view of the main straight from Turn 1 (after the 2014 MotoGP race)]]\n[[File:2018 US Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas.jpg|thumb|Circuit of the Americas during the [[2018 US Grand Prix]]]]\nIn an episode of [[Speed (TV channel)|Speed TV]]'s ''[[WindTunnel with Dave Despain|Wind Tunnel]]'' program broadcast on August 22, 2010, Tavo Hellmund revealed that the circuit would be 3.4 miles (5.5&nbsp;km) long and would be made up of twenty turns with an elevation change of 133 feet (41 m). The final plan of the circuit was released on September 1, 2010, showing a design inspired by the European tradition of sculpting the circuit to the contours of the land. The design draws from several European Formula One circuits, including a recreation of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone's]] Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel sequence, [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim's]] arena bends, and a replica of [[Istanbul Park|Istanbul]]'s Turn Eight.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Austin circuit layout revealed|publisher=Formula One Administration|work=formula1.com|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2010/9/11198.html|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref> Other corners were loosely inspired by the Senna 'S' at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] and the [[Red Bull Ring#Original track|\u00d6sterreichring's]] Sebring-Auspuffkurve.<ref name=\"Tavo & Kevin\"/> A feature of the circuit is a deliberate widening of corners, to encourage drivers to follow multiple racing lines.<ref>{{cite news|work=ESPN F1|publisher=ESPN Emea Ltd.|url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/52061.html|title=F1 Texan style|first=Mark|last=Sutton|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> A similar feature was used at the [[Buddh International Circuit]] in [[India]], where the circuit widens on the approach to certain corners.\n\nThe circuit was one of only a handful on the Formula One 2012 calendar to be run counter-clockwise, the others being [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Marina Bay]], the [[Korea International Circuit]], [[Yas Marina Circuit|Yas Marina]], and [[Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace|Interlagos]]. Because of this, the circuit contains more left-hand turns than right-hand ones, placing greater physical demands on the drivers whose bodies, particularly their necks, are more adapted to the lateral [[g-forces]] of clockwise circuits.\n[[File:Circuit of the Americas - Pit Lane.jpg|thumb|left|Pit lane]]\nFrom the start line, the drivers climb a gradient of over 11% to the first corner\u2014the highest point of the circuit\u2014with the apex of the corner positioned on the crest of the hill. They descend the hill to navigate a series of fast sweepers modeled on Silverstone's Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel complex and through a blind corner at Turn 10, taking them to the far end of the circuit and a hairpin at Turn 11. The drivers then follow a {{convert|0.62|mi|km|adj=on}} straight back towards the pit and paddock area before entering the final sector of the lap and weaving through a series of corners modeled on Hockenheim's stadium section. This is followed by a downhill, multi-apex corner with limited run-off before the final two corners of the circuit, a pair of left-hand bends that return the drivers to the main straight.\n\n====Reception====\nThe reception from drivers ahead of the [[2012 United States Grand Prix|inaugural race]] was highly positive.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

{"title_page": "DBX1", "text_new": "{{Infobox_gene}}\n'''Homeobox protein DBX1''', also known as '''developing brain homeobox protein 1''', is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''DBX1'' [[gene]]. The DBX1 gene is a transcription factor gene that is pivotal in interneuron differentiation in the ventral spinal cord. \n\nThe spinal interneurons V0 and V1 are derived from progenitor domains that are differentiated by the expression of homeodomain proteins DBX1 and DBX2.

After the discovery of hominins at [[Taung]] and australopithecine fossils in limestone caves at [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], and [[Kromdraai]] these areas were collectively designated a World Heritage site.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa/History#ref1003524</ref> The first inhabitants of South Africa are collectively referred to as the [[Khoisan]], the Khoi Khoi and the San separately. These groups were displaced or sometimes absorbed by migrating Africans (Bantus) during the [[Bantu expansion]] from Western and Central Africa. While some maintained separateness, others were grouped into a category known as [[Coloureds]], a multiracial ethnic group which includes people with shared ancestry from two or more of these groups: [[Khoisan]], [[Bantus|Bantu]], [[English people|English]], [[Afrikaners]], [[Austronesians]], [[East Asians]] and [[South Asians]].<ref>https://www.khoisanpeoples.org/indepth/khoi-san-language.htm</ref> European exploration of the African coast began in the 13th century when Portugal committed itself to discover an alternative route to the [[silk road]] that would lead to China. In the 14th and 15th century, Portuguese explorers traveled down the west African Coast, detailing and mapping the coastline and in 1488 they rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref>https://study.com/academy/lesson/portuguese-dutch-exploration-of-south-africa.html</ref> The [[Dutch East India Company]] established a trading post in [[Cape Town]] under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in 1652,<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/dutch-east-india-company-deicvoc</ref> European workers who settled at the Cape became known as the [[Free Burghers]] and gradually established farms in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]].<ref>https://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=1294</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Invasion of the Cape Colony]] in 1795 and 1806, mass migrations collectively known as the [[Great trek|Great Trek]] occurred during which the Voortrekkers established several [[Boer]] settlements on the interior of South Africa.<ref>http://www.geskiedenis.sariemarais.com/groot%20trek.html</ref> The discoveries of diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the region, propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards industrialisation and the development of urban infrastructure. The discoveries also led to new conflicts culminating in open warfare between the [[Boer]] settlers and the British Empire, fought essentially for control over the nascent South African mining industry.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Boers in the Anglo-Boer or [[South African War]] (1899\u20131902), the [[Union of South Africa]] was created as a [[Associated state|self-governing]] dominion of the [[British Empire]] on 31 May 1910 in terms of the [[South Africa Act 1909]], which amalgamated the four previously separate British colonies: [[Cape Colony]], [[Colony of Natal]], [[Transvaal Colony]], and [[Orange River Colony]]. The country became a fully sovereign [[nation state]] within the British Empire, in 1934 following enactment of the [[Status of the Union Act]]. The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced by a [[republic]] as the consequence of a [[1960 South African republic referendum|1960 referendum]], which legitimised the country becoming the [[Republic of South Africa]].\n\nFrom 1948\u20131994, South African politics was dominated by [[Afrikaner nationalism]]. Racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], an [[Afrikaans]] word meaning \"separateness\u201d, was implemented in 1948. On 27 April 1994, after decades of armed struggle, [[terrorism]] and international opposition to apartheid, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) achieved victory in the country's first democratic election. Since then, the African National Congress has governed South Africa, in an alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]].\n\n==Early history (before 1652)==\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{see|Khoisan|Khoisanid|Peopling of Africa}}\nScientists researching the periods before written historical records were made have established that the territory of what is now referred to generically as South Africa was one of the important centers of [[human evolution]]. It was inhabited by [[Australopithecine]]s since at least 2.5 million years ago. [[Anatomically modern humans|Modern human]] settlement occurred around 125,000 years ago in the Middle Stone Age, as shown by archaeological discoveries at [[Klasies River Caves]].<ref>Bert Woodhouse, ''The Rock Art of the Golden Gate and Clarens Districts'', Johannesburg: Waterman 1996, p.34 \u2013 (citing report by Professor C van Riet Lowe and Dr D J H Visser, published in 1955 by government Department of Mines). {{ISBN|1 874959 31 5}}</ref> The first human habitation is associated with a DNA group originating in a northwestern area of southern Africa and still prevalent in the indigenous [[Khoisan]] ([[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]]). Southern Africa was later populated by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu-speaking people]] who [[Bantu expansion|migrated from the western region of central Africa]] during the early centuries AD.\n\nAt the [[Blombos cave]] Professor [[Raymond Dart]] discovered the skull of a 2.51 million year old [[Taung Child]] in 1924, the first example of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' ever found. Following in Dart's footsteps [[Robert Broom]] discovered a new much more robust hominid in 1938 ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'' at [[Kromdraai]], and in 1947 uncovered several more examples of ''Australopithecus africanus'' at [[Sterkfontein]]. In further research at the Blombos cave in 2002, stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This has been interpreted as the earliest example ever discovered of abstract art or symbolic art created by ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1753326.stm | work=BBC News | title='Oldest' prehistoric art unearthed | date=10 January 2002}}</ref>\n\nMany more species of early hominid have come to light in recent decades. The oldest is [[Little Foot]], a collection of footbones of an unknown hominid between 2.2 and 3.3 million years old, discovered at Sterkfontein by [[Ronald J. Clarke]]. An important recent find was that of 1.9 million year old ''[[Australopithecus sediba]]'', discovered in 2008. In 2015, the discovery near Johannesburg of a previously unknown species of ''Homo'' was announced, named ''[[Homo naledi]]''. It has been described as one of the most important paleontological discoveries in modern times.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150910-homo-naledi-human-ancestor-species-reaction-science/ ''National Geographic'', \"New Human Ancestor Elicits Awe\u2014and Many Questions\"], 10 September 2015.

Similarly, schools, justice and trade up to the arrival of the British, were all managed in the Dutch language. The language law caused friction, distrust and dissatisfaction.\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|300px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s]]\n\nAnother reason for Dutch-speaking white farmers trekking away from the Cape was the abolition of slavery by the British government on Emancipation Day, 1 December 1838.

This caused further dissatisfaction among the Dutch settlers. The settlers, incorrectly, believed that the Cape Colony administration had taken the money due to them as payment for freeing their slaves. Those settlers who were allocated money could only claim it in Britain in person or through an agent.

Philip's intention was for the Griquas to protect the missionary station there against [[banditti]] in the region, and as a bulwark against the northward movement of white settlers from the Cape Colony. Friction between the Griquas and the settlers over land rights resulted in British troops being sent to the region in 1845. It marked the beginning of nine years of British intervention in the affairs of the region, which the British named Transorange.<ref>Karel Schoeman, ''The British Presence in the Transorange 1845\u20131854'', Human & Rosseau, Cape Town, 1992, p.11, {{ISBN|0-7981-2965-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, to avoid the imminent prospect of either being colonised by the Cape Colony or coming into conflict with the expanding Boer Republic of [[Orange Free State]], most of the Philippolis Griquas embarked on a further trek.

The consequent frontier wars, known as the [[Xhosa Wars]], were unofficially referred to by the British colonial authorities as the \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\" wars. In the southeastern part of South Africa, The Boers and the Xhosa clashed along the Great Fish River, and in 1779 the first of nine frontier wars erupted. For nearly 100 years subsequently, the Xhosa fought the settlers sporadically, first the Boers or Afrikaners and later the British. In the Fourth Frontier War, which lasted from 1811 to 1812, the British forced the Xhosa back across the Great Fish River and established forts along this boundary.\n\nThe increasing economic involvement of the British in southern Africa from the 1820s, and especially following the discovery of first diamonds at Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal, resulted in pressure for land and African labour, and led to increasingly tense relations with African states.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1818 differences between two Xhosa leaders, Ndlambe and Ngqika, ended in Ngqika's defeat, but the British continued to recognise Ngqika as the paramount chief. He appealed to the British for help against Ndlambe, who retaliated in 1819 during the Fifth Frontier War by attacking the British colonial town of Grahamstown.\n\n====Wars against the Zulu====\n[[File:Cetshwayo-c1875.jpg|thumb|200px|King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]] (ca. 1875)]]In the eastern part of what is today South Africa, in the region named Natalia by the Boer trekkers, the latter negotiated an agreement with Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]] allowing the Boers to settle in part of the then Zulu kingdom.  Cattle rustling ensued and a party of Boers under the leadership of [[Piet Retief]] were killed.\n\nSubsequent to the killing of the Retief party, the Boers defended themselves against a Zulu attack, at the Ncome River on 16 December 1838. An estimated five thousand Zulu warriors were involved. The Boers took a defensive position with the high banks of the Ncome River forming a natural barrier to their rear with their ox waggons as barricades between themselves and the attacking Zulu army. About three thousand Zulu warriors died in the clash known historically as the [[Battle of Blood River]].<ref>Ngubane, Jordan K. ''An African Explains Apartheid''.

Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa.\n\nIn 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army. Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply. Bartle Frere then sent [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] to invade Zululand. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an overwhelming victory by the Zulu at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], as well as for being a landmark in the timeline of imperialism in the region.\n\nBritain's eventual defeat of the Zulus, marking the end of the Zulu nation's independence, was accomplished with the assistance of Zulu collaborators who harboured cultural and political resentments against centralised Zulu authority.<ref>Dacob Dlamini, [http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2015/07/27/jacob-zuma-a-spawn-of-collaborators-trying-to-right-old-wrongs \"Jacob Zuma a spawn of collaborators trying to right old wrongs\"], ''Rand Daily Mail'', 30 July 2015.

In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were loathe to live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.<ref>David B Coplan, ''Unconquered Territory: Narrating the Caledon Valley'', Journal of African Cultural Studies, Vol 13, No 2, December 2000, p.192</ref>\n\nThe British, who at that time controlled the area between the Orange and Vaal Rivers called the [[Orange River Sovereignty]],  decided a discernible boundary was necessary and proclaimed a line named the Warden Line, dividing the area between British and Basotho territories. This led to conflict between the Basotho and the British, who were defeated by Moshoeshoe's warriors at the battle of Viervoet in 1851.\n\nAs punishment to the Basotho, the governor and commander-in-chief of the Cape Colony, Sir George Cathcart, deployed troops to the Mohokare River; Moshoeshoe was ordered to pay a fine. When he did not pay the fine in full, a battle broke out on the Berea Plateau in 1852, where the British suffered heavy losses. In 1854, the British handed over the territory to the Boers through the signing of the [[Sand River Convention]].

In September 1854, 28 Boers accused of cattle rustling were killed in three separate incidents by an alliance of the Ndebele chiefdoms of Mokopane and Mankopane. Mokopane and his followers, anticipating retaliation by the settlers, retreated into the mountain caves known as Gwasa, (or Makapansgat in Afrikaans). In late October, Boer commandos supported by local Kgatla tribal collaborators laid siege to the caves. By the end of the siege, about three weeks later, Mokopane and between 1,000 and 3,000 people had died in the caves. The survivors were captured and allegedly enslaved.<ref>Isabel Hofmeyr, ''We Spend Our Years as a Tale that is Told: Oral Historical Narrative in a South African Chiefdom''.

Further friction was caused by the refusal of Sekhukhune to allow prospectors to search for gold in territory he considered to be sovereign and independent under his authority. The First Sekhukhune War of 1876 was conducted by the Boers, and the two separate campaigns of the Second Sekhukhune War of 1878/1879 were conducted by the British.<ref>H W Kinsey,[http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol025hk.html \"The Sekukuni Wars\"], ''South African Military History Journal'',\nVol 2 No 5 \u2013 June 1973.

After the discovery of hominins at [[Taung]] and australopithecine fossils in limestone caves at [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], and [[Kromdraai]] these areas were collectively designated a World Heritage site.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa/History#ref1003524</ref> The first inhabitants of South Africa are collectively referred to as the [[Khoisan]], the Khoi Khoi and the San separately. These groups were displaced or sometimes absorbed by migrating Africans (Bantus) during the [[Bantu expansion]] from Western and Central Africa. While some maintained separateness, others were grouped into a category known as [[Coloureds]], a multiracial ethnic group which includes people with shared ancestry from two or more of these groups: [[Khoisan]], [[Bantus|Bantu]], [[English people|English]], [[Afrikaners]], [[Austronesians]], [[East Asians]] and [[South Asians]]. <ref>https://www.khoisanpeoples.org/indepth/khoi-san-language.htm</ref> European exploration of the African coast began in the 13th century when Portugal committed itself to discover an alternative route to the [[silk road]] that would lead to China. In the 14th and 15th century, Portuguese explorers traveled down the west African Coast, detailing and mapping the coastline and in 1488 they rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. <ref>https://study.com/academy/lesson/portuguese-dutch-exploration-of-south-africa.html</ref> The [[Dutch East India Company]] established a trading post in [[Cape Town]] under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in 1652,<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/dutch-east-india-company-deicvoc</ref> European workers who settled at the Cape became known as the [[Free Burghers]] and gradually established farms in the [[Dutch Cape Colony]].<ref>https://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=1294</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Invasion of the Cape Colony]] in 1795 and 1806, mass migrations collectively known as the [[Great trek|Great Trek]] occurred during which the Voortrekkers established several [[Boer]] settlements on the interior of South Africa.<ref>http://www.geskiedenis.sariemarais.com/groot%20trek.html</ref> The discoveries of diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the region, propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards industrialisation and the development of urban infrastructure. The discoveries also led to new conflicts culminating in open warfare between the [[Boer]] settlers and the British Empire, fought essentially for control over the nascent South African mining industry.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Boers in the Anglo-Boer or [[South African War]] (1899\u20131902), the [[Union of South Africa]] was created as a [[Associated state|self-governing]] dominion of the [[British Empire]] on 31 May 1910 in terms of the [[South Africa Act 1909]], which amalgamated the four previously separate British colonies: [[Cape Colony]], [[Colony of Natal]], [[Transvaal Colony]], and [[Orange River Colony]]. The country became a fully sovereign [[nation state]] within the British Empire, in 1934 following enactment of the [[Status of the Union Act]]. The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced by a [[republic]] as the consequence of a [[1960 South African republic referendum|1960 referendum]], which legitimised the country becoming the [[Republic of South Africa]].\n\nFrom 1948\u20131994, South African politics was dominated by [[Afrikaner nationalism]]. Racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], an [[Afrikaans]] word meaning \"separateness\u201d, was implemented in 1948. On 27 April 1994, after decades of armed struggle, [[terrorism]] and international opposition to apartheid, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) achieved victory in the country's first democratic election. Since then, the African National Congress has governed South Africa, in an alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]].\n\n==Early history (before 1652)==\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{see|Khoisan|Khoisanid|Peopling of Africa}}\nScientists researching the periods before written historical records were made have established that the territory of what is now referred to generically as South Africa was one of the important centers of [[human evolution]]. It was inhabited by [[Australopithecine]]s since at least 2.5 million years ago. [[Anatomically modern humans|Modern human]] settlement occurred around 125,000 years ago in the Middle Stone Age, as shown by archaeological discoveries at [[Klasies River Caves]].<ref>Bert Woodhouse, ''The Rock Art of the Golden Gate and Clarens Districts'', Johannesburg: Waterman 1996, p.34 \u2013 (citing report by Professor C van Riet Lowe and Dr D J H Visser, published in 1955 by government Department of Mines). {{ISBN|1 874959 31 5}}</ref> The first human habitation is associated with a DNA group originating in a northwestern area of southern Africa and still prevalent in the indigenous [[Khoisan]] ([[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]]). Southern Africa was later populated by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu-speaking people]] who [[Bantu expansion|migrated from the western region of central Africa]] during the early centuries AD.\n\nAt the [[Blombos cave]] Professor [[Raymond Dart]] discovered the skull of a 2.51 million year old [[Taung Child]] in 1924, the first example of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' ever found. Following in Dart's footsteps [[Robert Broom]] discovered a new much more robust hominid in 1938 ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'' at [[Kromdraai]], and in 1947 uncovered several more examples of ''Australopithecus africanus'' at [[Sterkfontein]].

Eventually, in the 1830s, large numbers of Boers migrated in what came to be known as the [[Great Trek]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Among the initial reasons for their leaving the Cape colony were the English language rule. Religion was a very important aspect of the settlers culture and the bible and church services were in Dutch. Similarly, schools, justice and trade up to the arrival of the British, were all managed in the Dutch language. The language law caused friction, distrust and dissatisfaction.\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|300px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s]]\n\nAnother reason for Dutch-speaking white farmers trekking away from the Cape was the abolition of slavery by the British government on Emancipation Day, 1 December 1838.

This caused further dissatisfaction among the Dutch settlers. The settlers, incorrectly, believed that the Cape Colony administration had taken the money due to them as payment for freeing their slaves. Those settlers who were allocated money could only claim it in Britain in person or through an agent. The commission charged by agents was the same as the payment for one slave, thus those settlers only claiming for one slave would receive nothing.<ref name=krugerp>{{cite book|last=Kruger|first=Paul|title=Memoirs of Paul Kruger|year=1902|publisher=George R Morang and Co|location=Canada|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoirsofpaulkru00kruguoft/page/n26 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofpaulkru00kruguoft}}</ref>\n\n====South African Republic====\n{{Main|South African Republic}}\n[[File:Flag of Transvaal.svg|thumb|left|200px|[[Flag of the South African Republic]], often referred to as the ''Vierkleur'' (meaning four-coloured)]] The South African Republic (Dutch: ''Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek'' or ZAR, not to be confused with the much later [[Republic of South Africa]]), is often referred to as The Transvaal and sometimes as the Republic of Transvaal.

Philip's intention was for the Griquas to protect the missionary station there against [[banditti]] in the region, and as a bulwark against the northward movement of white settlers from the Cape Colony. Friction between the Griquas and the settlers over land rights resulted in British troops being sent to the region in 1845. It marked the beginning of nine years of British intervention in the affairs of the region, which the British named Transorange.<ref>Karel Schoeman, ''The British Presence in the Transorange 1845\u20131854'', Human & Rosseau, Cape Town, 1992, p.11, {{ISBN|0-7981-2965-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, to avoid the imminent prospect of either being colonised by the Cape Colony or coming into conflict with the expanding Boer Republic of [[Orange Free State]], most of the Philippolis Griquas embarked on a further trek.

The consequent frontier wars, known as the [[Xhosa Wars]], were unofficially referred to by the British colonial authorities as the \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\" wars. In the southeastern part of South Africa, The Boers and the Xhosa clashed along the Great Fish River, and in 1779 the first of nine frontier wars erupted. For nearly 100 years subsequently, the Xhosa fought the settlers sporadically, first the Boers or Afrikaners and later the British. In the Fourth Frontier War, which lasted from 1811 to 1812, the British forced the Xhosa back across the Great Fish River and established forts along this boundary.\n\nThe increasing economic involvement of the British in southern Africa from the 1820s, and especially following the discovery of first diamonds at Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal, resulted in pressure for land and African labour, and led to increasingly tense relations with African states.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1818 differences between two Xhosa leaders, Ndlambe and Ngqika, ended in Ngqika's defeat, but the British continued to recognise Ngqika as the paramount chief. He appealed to the British for help against Ndlambe, who retaliated in 1819 during the Fifth Frontier War by attacking the British colonial town of Grahamstown.\n\n====Wars against the Zulu====\n[[File:Cetshwayo-c1875.jpg|thumb|200px|King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]] (ca. 1875)]]In the eastern part of what is today South Africa, in the region named Natalia by the Boer trekkers, the latter negotiated an agreement with Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona]] allowing the Boers to settle in part of the then Zulu kingdom.  Cattle rustling ensued and a party of Boers under the leadership of [[Piet Retief]] were killed.\n\nSubsequent to the killing of the Retief party, the Boers defended themselves against a Zulu attack, at the Ncome River on 16 December 1838. An estimated five thousand Zulu warriors were involved. The Boers took a defensive position with the high banks of the Ncome River forming a natural barrier to their rear with their ox waggons as barricades between themselves and the attacking Zulu army. About three thousand Zulu warriors died in the clash known historically as the [[Battle of Blood River]].<ref>Ngubane, Jordan K. ''An African Explains Apartheid''.

Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa.\n\nIn 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army. Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply. Bartle Frere then sent [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] to invade Zululand. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an overwhelming victory by the Zulu at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], as well as for being a landmark in the timeline of imperialism in the region.\n\nBritain's eventual defeat of the Zulus, marking the end of the Zulu nation's independence, was accomplished with the assistance of Zulu collaborators who harboured cultural and political resentments against centralised Zulu authority.<ref>Dacob Dlamini, [http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2015/07/27/jacob-zuma-a-spawn-of-collaborators-trying-to-right-old-wrongs \"Jacob Zuma a spawn of collaborators trying to right old wrongs\"], ''Rand Daily Mail'', 30 July 2015.

In 1845, a treaty was signed between the British colonists and Moshoeshoe, which recognised white settlement in the area. No firm boundaries were drawn between the area of white settlement and Moshoeshoe's kingdom, which led to border clashes. Moshoeshoe was under the impression he was loaning grazing land to the settlers in accordance with African precepts of occupation rather than ownership, while the settlers believed they had been granted permanent land rights. Afrikaner settlers in particular were loathe to live under Moshoesoe's authority and among Africans.<ref>David B Coplan, ''Unconquered Territory: Narrating the Caledon Valley'', Journal of African Cultural Studies, Vol 13, No 2, December 2000, p.192</ref>\n\nThe British, who at that time controlled the area between the Orange and Vaal Rivers called the [[Orange River Sovereignty]],  decided a discernible boundary was necessary and proclaimed a line named the Warden Line, dividing the area between British and Basotho territories. This led to conflict between the Basotho and the British, who were defeated by Moshoeshoe's warriors at the battle of Viervoet in 1851.\n\nAs punishment to the Basotho, the governor and commander-in-chief of the Cape Colony, Sir George Cathcart, deployed troops to the Mohokare River; Moshoeshoe was ordered to pay a fine. When he did not pay the fine in full, a battle broke out on the Berea Plateau in 1852, where the British suffered heavy losses. In 1854, the British handed over the territory to the Boers through the signing of the [[Sand River Convention]].

Mokopane and his followers, anticipating retaliation by the settlers, retreated into the mountain caves known as Gwasa, (or Makapansgat in Afrikaans). In late October, Boer commandos supported by local Kgatla tribal collaborators laid siege to the caves. By the end of the siege, about three weeks later, Mokopane and between 1,000 and 3,000 people had died in the caves. The survivors were captured and allegedly enslaved.<ref>Isabel Hofmeyr, ''We Spend Our Years as a Tale that is Told: Oral Historical Narrative in a South African Chiefdom''.

Further friction was caused by the refusal of Sekhukhune to allow prospectors to search for gold in territory he considered to be sovereign and independent under his authority.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> This dark match aired on the April 6 episode of ''Raw''.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe event was positively received by fans and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) faced Austin Theory and Angel Garza (accompanied by Zelina Vega) in a rematch for the titles where the champions retained once again, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> This dark match aired on the April 6 episode of ''Raw''.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe event was positively received by fans and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) faced Austin Theory and Angel Garza (accompanied by Zelina Vega) in a rematch for the titles where the champions retained once again, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

A sequel to 2013's ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', it is the seventh installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise and stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Jason Statham]]. ''Furious 7'' follows [[Dominic Toretto]] (Diesel), [[Brian O'Conner]] (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the [[United States]] to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in ''Fast & Furious 6'', until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again.\n\nWith the previous three installments set between ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006), ''Furious 7'' is the first installment in the franchise to take place after ''Tokyo Drift''. The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker.

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' FBI office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

On the decision, Diesel said:<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/>\n\n<blockquote>We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages&nbsp; ... &nbsp;The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, in an interview on February 15, 2012, [[Dwayne Johnson]] stated that the two intended sequels would no longer be filmed simultaneously because of weather issues in filming locations, and that production on ''Fast Seven'' would only begin after the completion of ''Fast Six''.<ref name=\"SequelFeb1512\"/>\n\nIn April 2013, during post-production of the retitled ''Fast & Furious 6'', Lin announced that he would not return to direct a seventh film, as the studio wanted to produce the film on an accelerated schedule for release in summer 2014. This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|tenth highest-grossing opening of all time]].

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' FBI office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.
