His retreat was ascribed to the favor of [[Hephaestos]] towards Sethos, his priest. In the night, while the Assyrians slept, a host of field-mice gnawed the bow-strings and shield-straps of the Assyrians, who fled, and many of them were slain in their flight by the [[Egyptians]]. Herodotus saw in the temple of Hephaestos at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], a record of this victory of the Egyptians, ''viz.'' a statue of Sethos holding a mouse in his hand. The story probably rests on the fact that in the symbolism of Egypt the mouse implied destruction. (Compare Horapolis ''Hieroglyph.'' i. 50; [[Claudius Aelianus]], ''De Natura Animalium'' vi. 41.)\n* The decisive [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle]] which transferred the throne of the [[Pharaoh]]s to [[Cambyses II]], king of the [[Persia]]ns, was fought near Pelusium in 525 BC. The fields around were strewn with the bones of the combatants when Herodotus visited. He noted that the skulls of the Egyptians were distinguishable from those of the Persians by their superior hardness, a fact confirmed he said by the mummies. He ascribed this to the Egyptians' shaving their heads from infancy, and to the Persians covering them up with folds of cloth or linen. (Herodotus ii. 10, seq.); however, according to legend, Pelusium fell without a fight, by the simple expedient of having the invading army drive cats (sacred to the local goddess [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]]) before them. As Cambyses advanced at once to Memphis, Pelusium probably surrendered itself immediately after the battle. (Polyaen. ''Stratag.'' vii. 9.)\n* In 373 BC, [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]], satrap of [[Phrygia]], and [[Iphicrates]], the commander of the [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] armament, appeared before Pelusium, but retired without attacking it, [[Nectanebo I]], king of Egypt, having added to its former defences by laying the neighboring lands under water, and blocking up the navigable channels of the Nile by embankments. ([[Diodorus Siculus]] xv. 42; [[Cornelius Nepos]], ''[[Iphicrates]]'' c. 5.)\n* Pelusium was attacked and taken by the Persians, 343 BC (344 BC ?). The city contained at the time a garrison of 5,000 Greek mercenaries under the command of [[Philophron]]. At first, owing to the rashness of the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] in the Persian service, the defenders had the advantage. But the Egyptian king [[Nectanebo II]] hastily venturing on a pitched battle, his troops were cut to pieces, and Pelusium surrendered to the Theban general [[Lacrates]] on honorable conditions. (Diodorus Siculus xvi. 43.)\n* In 333 BC, Pelusium opened its gates to [[Alexander the Great]], who placed a garrison in it under the command of one of those officers entitled Companions of the King. ([[Arrian]], ''Exp. Alex.'' iii. 1, seq.; Quintus Curtius iv. 33.)\n* In 173 BC, [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] utterly defeated the troops of [[Ptolemy Philometor]] under the walls of Pelusium, which he took and retained after he had retired from the rest of Egypt. ([[Polybius]] ''Legat.'' \u00a7 82; Hieronym. ''in Daniel.'' xi.) On the fall of the Syrian kingdom, however, if not earlier, Pelusium had been restored to the [[Ptolemies]].\n* In 55 BC, again belonging to Egypt, [[Mark Antony]], as cavalry general to the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] proconsul [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]], defeated the Egyptian army, and made himself master of the city. [[Ptolemy Auletes]], in whose behalf the Romans invaded Egypt at this time, wished to put the Pelusians to the sword; but his intention was thwarted by Mark Anthony. ([[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Anton.'' c. 3; Valerius Max. ix. 1.)\n* In 48 BC, [[Pompey]] was murdered in Pelusium.\n* In 30 BC, more than half a year after his victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]], [[Augustus]] appeared before Pelusium, and was admitted by its governor [[Seleucus (commandant)|Seleucus]] within its walls.\n* In 501 AD, Pelusium suffered greatly from the Persian invasion of Egypt ([[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]], Annal.).\n* In 541 AD, the [[Plague of Justinian]] was first reported and began to spread across the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n* In 639, Pelusium offered a protracted, though, in the end, an ineffectual resistance to the arms of [[Amr ibn al-As]]. As on former occasions, the surrender of the key of the Delta was nearly equivalent to the subjugation of Egypt itself.\n* In 749, Pelusium was raided by the [[Bashmurian revolts|Bashmuric Copts]].\n* In ca. 870, Pelusium is mentioned as a major port in the trade network of the [[Radhanite]] merchants.\n* In 1118, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] razed the city to the ground, but died shortly afterwards of food poisoning after eating a plateful of the local fish.\n\nThe khalifs who ruled Pelusium following [[the Crusades]], however, generally neglected the harbors, and from that period Pelusium, which had long been on the decline, almost disappeared from history.\n\n== Roman military roads ==\nOf the six military roads formed or adopted by the Romans in Egypt, the following are mentioned in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itinerarium of Antoninus]] as connected with Pelusium:\n* From Memphis to Pelusium. This road joined the great road from [[Pselcis]] in [[Nubia]] at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]], nearly opposite Memphis, and coincided with it as far as [[Scenae Veteranorum]]. The two roads, ''viz.'' that from Pselcis to Scenae Veteranorum, which turned off to the east at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and that from Memphis to Pelusium, connected the latter city with the capital of Lower Egypt, Trajan's canal, and [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoe]], near Suez, on the Sinus Heroopolites ([[Gulf of Suez]]).\n* From [[Acre, Israel|Acca]] to [[Alexandria]], ran along the Mediterranean sea from [[Raphia (town)|Raphia]] to Pelusium.\n\n== Ecclesiastical history ==\nPelusium is named (as \"Sin, the strength of Egypt\") in the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Ezekiel]], chapter 30:15.\n\nPelusium became the seat of a Christian bishop at an early stage. Its bishop Dorotheus took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. In 335, Marcus was exiled because of his support for [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. His replacement Pancratius, an exponent of [[Arianism]], was at the [[Second Council of Sirmium]] in 351. Several of the succeeding known bishops of Pelusium were also considered heretical by the orthodox. As the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Augustamnica Prima]], Pelusium was ecclesiastically the [[metropolitan see]] of the province.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 531-534</ref><ref>Klaas A.

It is not certain whether or not the 10th-century rabbi and scholar, [[Saadia Gaon]], agreed with that determination, although he possessed another tradition of later making, writing that ''[[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]]'' mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] [https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0433.htm 33:3], and in Exodus 1:11 and 12:37, as also in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0147.htm#11 47:11], refers to the Egyptian town of ''\u02bb[[Ain Shams]]''.<ref>Saadia Gaon, ''Judeo-Arabic Translation of Pentateuch'' (''Tafsir''), s.v.

His retreat was ascribed to the favor of [[Hephaestos]] towards Sethos, his priest. In the night, while the Assyrians slept, a host of field-mice gnawed the bow-strings and shield-straps of the Assyrians, who fled, and many of them were slain in their flight by the [[Egyptians]]. Herodotus saw in the temple of Hephaestos at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], a record of this victory of the Egyptians, ''viz.'' a statue of Sethos holding a mouse in his hand. The story probably rests on the fact that in the symbolism of Egypt the mouse implied destruction. (Compare Horapolis ''Hieroglyph.'' i. 50; [[Claudius Aelianus]], ''De Natura Animalium'' vi. 41.)\n* The decisive [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle]] which transferred the throne of the [[Pharaoh]]s to [[Cambyses II]], king of the [[Persia]]ns, was fought near Pelusium in 525 BC. The fields around were strewn with the bones of the combatants when Herodotus visited. He noted that the skulls of the Egyptians were distinguishable from those of the Persians by their superior hardness, a fact confirmed he said by the mummies. He ascribed this to the Egyptians' shaving their heads from infancy, and to the Persians covering them up with folds of cloth or linen. (Herodotus ii. 10, seq.); however, according to legend, Pelusium fell without a fight, by the simple expedient of having the invading army drive cats (sacred to the local goddess [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]]) before them. As Cambyses advanced at once to Memphis, Pelusium probably surrendered itself immediately after the battle. (Polyaen. ''Stratag.'' vii. 9.)\n* In 373 BC, [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]], satrap of [[Phrygia]], and [[Iphicrates]], the commander of the [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] armament, appeared before Pelusium, but retired without attacking it, [[Nectanebo I]], king of Egypt, having added to its former defences by laying the neighboring lands under water, and blocking up the navigable channels of the Nile by embankments. ([[Diodorus Siculus]] xv. 42; [[Cornelius Nepos]], ''[[Iphicrates]]'' c. 5.)\n* Pelusium was attacked and taken by the Persians, 343 BC (344 BC ?). The city contained at the time a garrison of 5,000 Greek mercenaries under the command of [[Philophron]]. At first, owing to the rashness of the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] in the Persian service, the defenders had the advantage. But the Egyptian king [[Nectanebo II]] hastily venturing on a pitched battle, his troops were cut to pieces, and Pelusium surrendered to the Theban general [[Lacrates]] on honorable conditions. (Diodorus Siculus xvi. 43.)\n* In 333 BC, Pelusium opened its gates to [[Alexander the Great]], who placed a garrison in it under the command of one of those officers entitled Companions of the King. ([[Arrian]], ''Exp. Alex.'' iii. 1, seq.; Quintus Curtius iv. 33.)\n* In 173 BC, [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] utterly defeated the troops of [[Ptolemy Philometor]] under the walls of Pelusium, which he took and retained after he had retired from the rest of Egypt. ([[Polybius]] ''Legat.'' \u00a7 82; Hieronym. ''in Daniel.'' xi.) On the fall of the Syrian kingdom, however, if not earlier, Pelusium had been restored to the [[Ptolemies]].\n* In 55 BC, again belonging to Egypt, [[Mark Antony]], as cavalry general to the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] proconsul [[Aulus Gabinius|Gabinius]], defeated the Egyptian army, and made himself master of the city. [[Ptolemy Auletes]], in whose behalf the Romans invaded Egypt at this time, wished to put the Pelusians to the sword; but his intention was thwarted by Mark Anthony. ([[Plutarch|Plut.]] ''Anton.'' c. 3; Valerius Max. ix. 1.)\n* In 48 BC, [[Pompey]] was murdered in Pelusium.\n* In 30 BC, more than half a year after his victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]], [[Augustus]] appeared before Pelusium, and was admitted by its governor [[Seleucus (commandant)|Seleucus]] within its walls.\n* In 501 AD, Pelusium suffered greatly from the Persian invasion of Egypt ([[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]], Annal.).\n* In 541 AD, the [[Plague of Justinian]] was first reported and began to spread across the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n* In 639, Pelusium offered a protracted, though, in the end, an ineffectual resistance to the arms of [[Amr ibn al-As]]. As on former occasions, the surrender of the key of the Delta was nearly equivalent to the subjugation of Egypt itself.\n* In 749, Pelusium was raided by the [[Bashmurian revolts|Bashmuric Copts]].\n* In ca. 870, Pelusium is mentioned as a major port in the trade network of the [[Radhanite]] merchants.\n* In 1118, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] razed the city to the ground, but died shortly afterwards of food poisoning after eating a plateful of the local fish.\n\nThe khalifs who ruled Pelusium following [[the Crusades]], however, generally neglected the harbors, and from that period Pelusium, which had long been on the decline, almost disappeared from history.\n\n== Roman military roads ==\nOf the six military roads formed or adopted by the Romans in Egypt, the following are mentioned in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itinerarium of Antoninus]] as connected with Pelusium:\n* From Memphis to Pelusium. This road joined the great road from [[Pselcis]] in [[Nubia]] at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]], nearly opposite Memphis, and coincided with it as far as [[Scenae Veteranorum]]. The two roads, ''viz.'' that from Pselcis to Scenae Veteranorum, which turned off to the east at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and that from Memphis to Pelusium, connected the latter city with the capital of Lower Egypt, Trajan's canal, and [[Arsinoe (Gulf of Suez)|Arsinoe]], near Suez, on the Sinus Heroopolites ([[Gulf of Suez]]).\n* From [[Acre, Israel|Acca]] to [[Alexandria]], ran along the Mediterranean sea from [[Raphia (town)|Raphia]] to Pelusium.\n\n== Ecclesiastical history ==\nPelusium is named (as \"Sin, the strength of Egypt\") in the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Ezekiel]], chapter 30:15.\n\nPelusium became the seat of a Christian bishop at an early stage. Its bishop Dorotheus took part in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. In 335, Marcus was exiled because of his support for [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. His replacement Pancratius, an exponent of [[Arianism]], was at the [[Second Council of Sirmium]] in 351. Several of the succeeding known bishops of Pelusium were also considered heretical by the orthodox. As the capital of the [[Roman province]] of [[Augustamnica Prima]], Pelusium was ecclesiastically the [[metropolitan see]] of the province.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 531-534</ref><ref>Klaas A.

The name Tolstoy (Russian \"\u0422\u043e\u043b\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\") is itself derived from the Russian adjective \"\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0439\" (\"thick, stout, fat\"). They are the descendants of Andrey Kharitonovich Tolstoy (\"the Fat\"), who moved from [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]] to Moscow and served under [[Vasili II of Russia|Vasily II of Moscow]] in the 15th century.

This marriage had allowed the average gentry family to enter the Moscow court. The Tolstoy family is also found amongst untitled provincial gentry of the same origins.\n\n==In the Napoleonic wars==\n[[File:Ostermann-tolstoi.jpg|right|thumb|Count Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy (1770\u20131857)]]\nTwo members of the family were active during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Count '''[[Pyotr Aleksandrovich Tolstoy]]''' (1761\u20131844) served under [[Suvorov]] in wars against Poland and Turkey, was made a general-adjutant in 1797, went as an ambassador to [[Paris]] in 1807 and tried to persuade [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to prepare for the war against France, without much success though. He served as the governor of [[St Petersburg]] and [[Kronstadt]] from 1828 until his death.\n\n'''[[Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy|Alexander Ivanovich Tolstoy]]''' (1770\u20131857), stemming from a collateral branch of the family, inherited the comital title and estates of [[Ivan Osterman|his childless uncle]], the last of the [[Osterman]]ns. \n\nHe first distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Czarnowo]] on the night and following morning of 23\u201324 December 1806, where under his command the 2nd Division of the Russian Army in Poland held out for fifteen hours against the whole army commanded by [[Napoleon]]. One of the most admired generals of the anti-Napoleonic coalition, he was rewarded for his courage in the battles at [[battle of Pultusk|Pultusk]] and [[battle of Eylau|Eylau]]. At [[Dobre Miasto|Guttstadt]] he was wounded so seriously that they feared for his life. In the great [[battle of Borodino]] he brilliantly commanded the key positions until he was shell-shocked and taken away from the battlefield. Ostermann-Tolstoy was once again wounded in the [[battle of Bautzen]] (1813) but didn't give up command of his force. His crowning achievement was the [[battle of Kulm|victory at Kulm]] (August 30, 1813), which cost him amputation of the left arm. When the war was over, he quarreled with the Emperor, resigned and spent the rest of his life in Europe.\n\n==In high society==\nCount '''[[Fyodor Petrovich Tolstoy|Feodor Petrovich Tolstoy]]''' (1783\u20131873), sympathetically mentioned by [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] in ''Eugene Onegin'', was one of the most fashionable Russian drawers and painters of the 1820s. Although he prepared fine illustrations for [[Ippolit Bogdanovich|Bogdanovich]]'s ''Dushenka'', his genuine vocation was [[wax modeling]] and design of [[medals]]. As he gradually went blind he had to give up drawing and started writing [[ballet]]s and librettos for operas. He was appointed Vice-President of the Academy of Arts in 1828. Many of his works may be seen in the [[Russian Museum]], [[St Petersburg]].\n\n[[File:tolstoy rooms.jpg|left|thumb|Feodor Tolstoy's watercolour of his house in Moscow]]\nCount '''[[Fyodor Ivanovich Tolstoy]]''' (1782\u20131846) was a notorious drunkard, gastronome, and duellist. It is said that he killed 11 people in [[duels]]. In 1803 he participated in the first Russian [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth. After he had his body tattooed at the [[Marquesas]] and debauched all the crew, captain [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]] had to maroon him on the [[Aleutian Islands]] near [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]]. When he returned to St Petersburg, Count Fedor was nicknamed ''Amerikanets'' (\"the American\"). He fought bravely in the [[Patriotic War of 1812]] but scandalized his family again by marrying a Gypsy singer in 1821. [[Alexander Griboyedov]] satirized him in ''[[Woe from Wit]]'', and his cousin [[Leo Tolstoy]] \u2014 who called him an \"extraordinary, criminal, and attractive man\" \u2014 fictionalized him as Dolokhov in ''War and Peace''.\n\n==In Russian literature==\nMany of the Tolstoys devoted their spare time to literary pursuits. For instance, Count '''[[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|Alexei Konstantinovich]]''' (1817\u201375) was a courtier but also one of the most popular Russian poets of his time. He wrote admirable [[ballad]]s, a historical novel, some licentious verse, and [[satire]]s published under the penname of [[Kozma Prutkov]]. His lasting contribution to the Russian literature was a trilogy of historical dramas, modelled after [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s ''Boris Godunov''.\n\n[[File:tolstoy kramskoy.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivan Kramskoi|Kramskoy]]'s portrait of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1873)]]\nCount '''Lev Nikolaevich''' (1828\u20131910), more widely known abroad as [[Leo Tolstoy]], is acclaimed as one of the greatest novelists of all time. After he started his career in the military, he was first drawn to writing books when he served in [[Chechenya]], and already his first story, ''Detstvo'' (\"[[Childhood (Tolstoy novel)|Childhood]]\"), was something quite unlike anything written before him. It was in his family estate [[Yasnaya Polyana]] near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] that he created two novels, ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', that are widely acclaimed as among the best novels ever written. Later he developed [[Tolstoyan|a kind of non-traditional Christian philosophy]], described in his work ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'' which inspired [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Mohandas Gandhi]], then a young lawyer, whose influence extended to [[Martin Luther King]].\n\nOf Lev's thirteen children, most spent their life either promoting his teachings or denouncing them. His youngest daughter and secretary, '''[[Alexandra Lvovna]]''' (1884\u20131979), had a particularly troubled life. Although she shared with her father the doctrine of [[non-violence]], she felt it was her duty to take part in the events of [[World War I]].\n\nCount '''[[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]]''' (1883\u20131945) belonged to a different branch of the family. His early short stories, published in 1910s, were panned by critics for excessive [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and wanton eroticism. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution]] he briefly emigrated to Germany, but then changed his political views and returned to the [[Soviet Union]]. His science fiction novels ''[[Aelita]]'' (1923), about a journey to Mars, and ''[[The Garin Death Ray]]'' (1927) are still popular with readers. In his later years he published two lengthy novels on historical subjects, ''Peter the First'' (1929\u201345) and ''The Road to Calvary'' (1922-41). As a staunch supporter of [[Joseph Stalin]], he became known as \"Red Count\" or \"Comrade Count\" and his work was acknowledged to be classics of the [[Soviet literature]]. Most of his reputation declined with that of [[Socialist Realism]], but his children's tale character [[Buratino]] retains his strong legacy with the younger audience of Russia and across the former Soviet space, appearing as popular reading, a movie, and a variety of derivative forms.\n\nHis granddaughter '''[[Tatyana Tolstaya|Tatiana Tolstaya]]''' (born in 1951) is one of the foremost Russian short story writers. Another living member of the family is '''[[Nikolai Tolstoy|Nikolai Tolstoy-Miloslavsky]]''' (born in 1935), a controversial British historian.\n\n==After the Russian revolution==\nSome of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the [[United States]].

He served as the governor of [[St Petersburg]] and [[Kronstadt]] from 1828 until his death.\n\n'''[[Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy|Alexander Ivanovich Tolstoy]]''' (1770\u20131857), stemming from a collateral branch of the family, inherited the comital title and estates of [[Ivan Osterman|his childless uncle]], the last of the [[Osterman]]ns. \n\nHe first distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Czarnowo]] on the night and following morning of 23\u201324 December 1806, where under his command the 2nd Division of the Russian Army in Poland held out for fifteen hours against the whole army commanded by [[Napoleon]]. One of the most admired generals of the anti-Napoleonic coalition, he was rewarded for his courage in the battles at [[battle of Pultusk|Pultusk]] and [[battle of Eylau|Eylau]]. At [[Dobre Miasto|Guttstadt]] he was wounded so seriously that they feared for his life. In the great [[battle of Borodino]] he brilliantly commanded the key positions until he was shell-shocked and taken away from the battlefield. Ostermann-Tolstoy was once again wounded in the [[battle of Bautzen]] (1813) but didn't give up command of his force. His crowning achievement was the [[battle of Kulm|victory at Kulm]] (August 30, 1813), which cost him amputation of the left arm. When the war was over, he quarreled with the Emperor, resigned and spent the rest of his life in Europe.\n\n==In high society==\nCount '''[[Fyodor Petrovich Tolstoy|Feodor Petrovich Tolstoy]]''' (1783\u20131873), sympathetically mentioned by [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] in ''Eugene Onegin'', was one of the most fashionable Russian drawers and painters of the 1820s. Although he prepared fine illustrations for [[Ippolit Bogdanovich|Bogdanovich]]'s ''Dushenka'', his genuine vocation was [[wax modeling]] and design of [[medals]]. As he gradually went blind he had to give up drawing and started writing [[ballet]]s and librettos for operas. He was appointed Vice-President of the Academy of Arts in 1828. Many of his works may be seen in the [[Russian Museum]], [[St Petersburg]].\n\n[[File:tolstoy rooms.jpg|left|thumb|Feodor Tolstoy's watercolour of his house in Moscow]]\nCount '''[[Fyodor Ivanovich Tolstoy]]''' (1782\u20131846) was a notorious drunkard, gastronome, and duellist. It is said that he killed 11 people in [[duels]]. In 1803 he participated in the first Russian [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth. After he had his body tattooed at the [[Marquesas]] and debauched all the crew, captain [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]] had to maroon him on the [[Aleutian Islands]] near [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]]. When he returned to St Petersburg, Count Fedor was nicknamed ''Amerikanets'' (\"the American\"). He fought bravely in the [[Patriotic War of 1812]] but scandalized his family again by marrying a Gypsy singer in 1821. [[Alexander Griboyedov]] satirized him in ''[[Woe from Wit]]'', and his cousin [[Leo Tolstoy]] \u2014 who called him an \"extraordinary, criminal, and attractive man\" \u2014 fictionalized him as Dolokhov in ''War and Peace''.\n\n==In Russian literature==\nMany of the Tolstoys devoted their spare time to literary pursuits. For instance, Count '''[[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|Alexei Konstantinovich]]''' (1817\u201375) was a courtier but also one of the most popular Russian poets of his time. He wrote admirable [[ballad]]s, a historical novel, some licentious verse, and [[satire]]s published under the penname of [[Kozma Prutkov]]. His lasting contribution to the Russian literature was a trilogy of historical dramas, modelled after [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s ''Boris Godunov''.\n\n[[File:tolstoy kramskoy.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivan Kramskoi|Kramskoy]]'s portrait of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1873)]]\nCount '''Lev Nikolaevich''' (1828\u20131910), more widely known abroad as [[Leo Tolstoy]], is acclaimed as one of the greatest novelists of all time. After he started his career in the military, he was first drawn to writing books when he served in [[Chechenya]], and already his first story, ''Detstvo'' (\"[[Childhood (Tolstoy novel)|Childhood]]\"), was something quite unlike anything written before him. It was in his family estate [[Yasnaya Polyana]] near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] that he created two novels, ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', that are widely acclaimed as among the best novels ever written. Later he developed [[Tolstoyan|a kind of non-traditional Christian philosophy]], described in his work ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'' which inspired [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Mohandas Gandhi]], then a young lawyer, whose influence extended to [[Martin Luther King]].\n\nOf Lev's thirteen children, most spent their life either promoting his teachings or denouncing them. His youngest daughter and secretary, '''[[Alexandra Lvovna]]''' (1884\u20131979), had a particularly troubled life. Although she shared with her father the doctrine of [[non-violence]], she felt it was her duty to take part in the events of [[World War I]].\n\nCount '''[[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]]''' (1883\u20131945) belonged to a different branch of the family. His early short stories, published in 1910s, were panned by critics for excessive [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and wanton eroticism. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution]] he briefly emigrated to Germany, but then changed his political views and returned to the [[Soviet Union]]. His science fiction novels ''[[Aelita]]'' (1923), about a journey to Mars, and ''[[The Garin Death Ray]]'' (1927) are still popular with readers. In his later years he published two lengthy novels on historical subjects, ''Peter the First'' (1929\u201345) and ''The Road to Calvary'' (1922-41). As a staunch supporter of [[Joseph Stalin]], he became known as \"Red Count\" or \"Comrade Count\" and his work was acknowledged to be classics of the [[Soviet literature]]. Most of his reputation declined with that of [[Socialist Realism]], but his children's tale character [[Buratino]] retains his strong legacy with the younger audience of Russia and across the former Soviet space, appearing as popular reading, a movie, and a variety of derivative forms.\n\nHis granddaughter '''[[Tatyana Tolstaya|Tatiana Tolstaya]]''' (born in 1951) is one of the foremost Russian short story writers. Another living member of the family is '''[[Nikolai Tolstoy|Nikolai Tolstoy-Miloslavsky]]''' (born in 1935), a controversial British historian.\n\n==After the Russian revolution==\nSome of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the Leo Tolstoy's relatives and descendants today live in [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and the [[United States]]. Among them are Swedish jazz singer [[Viktoria Tolstoy]].<ref>Nikolai Puzin, ''The Lev Tolstoy House-Museum In Yasnaya Polyana'' (with a list of Leo Tolstoy's descendants), 1998</ref> Leo Tolstoy's last surviving grandchild, Countess [[Tatiana Tolstoy-Paus]], died in 2007 at [[Herresta]] manor in Sweden, which is owned by Leo Tolstoy's descendants in the [[Paus family]].<ref>\"Tanja Paus och Sonja Ceder till minne,\" ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 11 March 2007</ref> Two of Leo Tolstoy's great-great-grandsons are [[Pyotr Olegovich Tolstoy|Pyotr Tolstoy]], a Russian TV presenter and [[State Duma]] deputy since 2016 and [[Vladimir Tolstoy]], journalist and adviser to the [[President of Russia]] on culture.<ref>[https://rg.ru/2012/05/23/putin-anons.html \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043b \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432]</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Tolstoi v1 p12.png|thumb|Coat of arms]]\n*[[Selivestr Ivanovich Tolstoy]] (?

That was never made but they decided to collaborate on this film.<ref name=\"stratton2\"/>\n\nHowson later said, \"It was the first film we'd done, and it was made with a lot of commercial requirements because we weren't in the position to just make a film and hope for the best.

The logic for this minimal effect is twofold: first, gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region, while distributing the preferred party's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed. The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase, and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter, who tends to be more ideologically moderate.

A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}</ref> Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\nThe shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197\u2013201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|issue=2|pages=318\u2013334|via=Electronic Journal Center|doi=10.1093/pa/gsn048}}</ref> Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.\n\n== Critiques ==\nThere have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.\n\n=== Limitations of the two-party system ===\nBy solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.<ref name=\"Baldassarri-08\" /><ref name=\"Fiorina-08\" /><ref name=\"Fiorina-06\" /> Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.<ref name=\"Baldassarri-08\" /><ref name=\"Fiorina-08\" />\n\n=== Issue partisanship ===\nDespite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,<ref name=\"abramowitz-08\" /> numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.<ref name=\"baldassarri-08\" /><ref name=\"fiorina-06\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988\u20132008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref> Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the \"hot topic\" or \"sensitive\" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).<ref name=\"layman-06\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual?

Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.<ref name=\"baldassarri-08\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural differences ===\nProponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.<ref name=\"abramowitz-05\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|url-status =dead|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012}}</ref> In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.\n\n=== Westernized focus ===\nMuch like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study.

The logic for this minimal effect is twofold: first, gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region, while distributing the preferred party's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed. The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase, and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter, who tends to be more ideologically moderate. Second, political polarization has also occurred in the Senate, which does not experience redistricting because Senators represent fixed geographical units, i.e. states.<ref name=\"mccarty-09\">{{cite journal|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|author2=Poole, Keith T.|author3=Rosenthal, Howard|date=1 July 2009|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x/asset/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x.pdf?v=1&t=hftg6kr2&s=4b7ba41c877789fda6a4bcd3356b1b64272b0c9e|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666\u2013680|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x}}</ref><ref name=\"masket-12\">{{cite journal|last=Masket|first=Seth E.|author2=Winburn, Jonathan|author3=Wright, Gerald C.|date=4 January 2012|title=The Gerrymanderers Are Coming!

A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}</ref> Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\nThe shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197\u2013201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|issue=2|pages=318\u2013334|via=Electronic Journal Center|doi=10.1093/pa/gsn048}}</ref> Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.\n\n== Critiques ==\nThere have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.\n\n=== Limitations of the two-party system ===\nBy solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.<ref name=\"Baldassarri-08\" /><ref name=\"Fiorina-08\" /><ref name=\"Fiorina-06\" /> Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.<ref name=\"Baldassarri-08\" /><ref name=\"Fiorina-08\" />\n\n=== Issue partisanship ===\nDespite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,<ref name=\"abramowitz-08\" /> numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.<ref name=\"baldassarri-08\" /><ref name=\"fiorina-06\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988\u20132008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref> Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the \"hot topic\" or \"sensitive\" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).<ref name=\"layman-06\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual?

Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.<ref name=\"baldassarri-08\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural differences ===\nProponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.<ref name=\"abramowitz-05\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|url-status =dead|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012}}</ref> In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.\n\n=== Westernized focus ===\nMuch like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study.

Genghis Khan unified the various tribes on the Mongol steppe, and his descendants eventually conquered almost the entirety of Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe. The military of the Mongol Empire is regarded to be the first modern military system.\n\nThe Mongol Army was organized into decimal units of tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands. A notable feature of the army is that it was composed entirely of cavalry units, giving it the advantage of maneuverability. Siege weaponry was adapted from other cultures, with foreign experts integrated into the command structure.\n\nThe Mongols rarely used naval power, with a few exceptions. In the 1260s and 1270s they used seapower while conquering the [[Song dynasty]] of China, though they were unable to mount successful seaborne campaigns against Japan due to storms and rough battles. Around the Eastern Mediterranean, their campaigns were almost exclusively land-based, with the seas being controlled by the Crusader and Mamluk forces.\n\nWith the disintegration of the Mongol Empire in the late 13th century, the Mongol Army as a unified unit also crumbled. The Mongols retreated back to their homeland after the fall of the [[Yuan Dynasty|Mongol Yuan Dynasty]], and once again delved into civil war. Although the Mongols became united once again during the reign of [[Mandukhai Khatun|Queen Mandukhai]] and [[Dayan Khan|Batmongkhe Dayan Khan]], in the 17th century they were annexed into the [[Qing Dynasty]].\n\n===Period under Qing Rule===\nOnce Mongolia was under the Qing, the Mongol Armies were used to defeat the Ming dynasty, helping to consolidate Manchu Rule. Mongols proved a useful ally in the war, lending their expertise as cavalry archers. During most of the Qing Dynasty time, the Mongols gave military assistance to the Manchus.<ref name=\"Bernard Hung-Kay Luk p.25\">Bernard Hung-Kay Luk, Amir Harrak-Contacts between cultures, Volume 4, p. 25</ref>\n\nWith the creation of the [[Eight Banners]], Banner Armies were broadly divided along ethnic lines, namely [[Manchu]] and [[Mongol]].\n\n=== Bogd Khanate (1911\u20131919) ===\nIn 1911, Outer Mongolia declared independence as the [[Outer Mongolia (1911\u20131919)|Bogd Khaanate]] under the [[Bogd Khan]]. This initial independence did not last, with [[Occupation of Mongolia|Mongolia being occupied successively]] by the Chinese [[Beiyang Government]], and [[Baron Ungern]]'s White Russian forces. The modern precursor to the Mongolian Armed Forces was placed, with men's conscription and a permanent military structure starting in 1912.<ref name=\"GeneralStaff\">{{cite web |url=http://gsmaf.gov.mn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13&Itemid=6&lang=mn |title=\u0417\u0425-\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u04af\u04af\u0445 |author=\u0417\u044d\u0432\u0441\u044d\u0433\u0442 \u0445\u04af\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0438\u043d \u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431 |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Mongolian People's Republic===\n{{main|Mongolian People's Army}}\nWith Independence lost again to foreign forces, the newly created [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] created a native communist army in 1920 under the leadership of [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]] in order to fight against Russian troops from the White movement and Chinese forces. The MPRP was aided by the [[Red Army]], which helped to secure the Mongolian People's Republic and remained in its territory until at least 1925. However, during the [[1932 armed uprising in Mongolia]] and the [[Soviet-Japanese border conflicts|initial Japanese border probes]] beginning in the mid-1930s, Soviet Red Army troops in Mongolia amounted to little more than instructors for the native army and as guards for diplomatic and trading installations.\n\n====Battles of Khalkhin Gol====\n{{See also|Battles of Khalkhin Gol}}\n[[File:SternGM.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Grigori Shtern]], [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] and [[Georgy Zhukov]] at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]].]]\n[[File:MNRA soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mongolian People's Army soldiers fight against Imperial Japanese soldiers. Khalkhin Gol, 1939.]]\nThe Battles of Khalkhin Gol began on 11 May 1939. A Mongolian cavalry unit of some 70\u201390 men had entered the disputed area in search of grazing for their horses.  On that day, Manchukuoan cavalry attacked the Mongolians and drove them back across the Khalkhin Gol. On 13 May, the Mongolian force returned in greater numbers and the Manchukoans were unable to dislodge them.\n\nOn 14 May, Lt. Col. [[Yaozo Azuma]] led the reconnaissance regiment of 23rd Infantry Division, supported by the 64th Infantry Regiment of the same division, under Colonel [[Takemitsu Yamagata]], into the territory and the Mongolians withdrew. Soviet and Mongolian troops returned to the disputed region, however, and Azuma's force again moved to evict them.  This time things turned out differently, as the Soviet\u2013Mongolian forces surrounded Azuma's force on 28 May and destroyed it.<ref>Drea, Edward J.

Soviet forces under the command of [[Georgy Zhukov]], together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars]].\n\nIn 1945, Mongolian forces participated in the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] under the command of the Red Army, among the last engagements of [[World War II]]. A Soviet\u2013Mongolian [[Cavalry mechanized group]] under [[Issa Pliyev]] took part as part of the Soviet [[Transbaikal Front]].<ref>http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/45-08-08/army_cav-mech.html {{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Mongolian troops numbered four cavalry divisions and three other regiments. During 1946\u20131948, the Mongolian People's Army successfully repelled attacks from the [[Kuomintang]]'s Hui regiment and their Kazakh allies in the border between Mongolia and Xinjiang. The attacks were propagated by the [[Ili Rebellion]], a Soviet-backed revolt by the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] against the Kuomintang Government of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. This little-known border dispute between Mongolia and the Republic of China became known as the [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]].\n\nThese engagements would be the last active battles the Mongolian Army would see, until after the democratic revolution.\n\n===After the Democratic Revolution===\n[[File:Military medical professionals from Mongolia, India, Canada, South Korea and the United States stand in formation at the cooperative health engagement and subject matter expert exchange closing ceremony for 130813-M-MG222-003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Military medical professionals from Mongolia, India, Canada, South Korea and the United States stand in formation at the cooperative health engagement and subject matter expert exchange closing ceremony for [[Khaan Quest]] 2013 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Aug. 13, 2013.]]\nMongolia [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia|underwent a democratic revolution in 1990]], ending the communist one-party state that had existed since the early 1920s.

In 2005/2006, Mongolian troops also served as part of the Belgian [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] contingent in [[Kosovo]]. From 2009 to 2010 Mongolian Armed Forces deployed its largest peace keeping mission to [[Chad]] and completed the mission successfully.  In 2011, the government decided to deploy its first fully self-sustained forces to the United Nations Mission [[UNMISS]] in [[South Sudan]]. Since then Mongolian Infantry battalion has been conducting the PKO tasks in Unity State of Republic of South Sudan. In addition, Mongolian Staff officers deployed at the Force Headquarter and Sector Headquarters of the UNMISS mission.

Genghis Khan unified the various tribes on the Mongol steppe, and his descendants eventually conquered almost the entirety of Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe. The military of the Mongol Empire is regarded to be the first modern military system.\n\nThe Mongol Army was organized into decimal units of tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands. A notable feature of the army is that it was composed entirely of cavalry units, giving it the advantage of maneuverability. Siege weaponry was adapted from other cultures, with foreign experts integrated into the command structure.\n\nThe Mongols rarely used naval power, with a few exceptions. In the 1260s and 1270s they used seapower while conquering the [[Song dynasty]] of China, though they were unable to mount successful seaborne campaigns against Japan due to storms and rough battles. Around the Eastern Mediterranean, their campaigns were almost exclusively land-based, with the seas being controlled by the Crusader and Mamluk forces.\n\nWith the disintegration of the Mongol Empire in the late 13th century, the Mongol Army as a unified unit also crumbled. The Mongols retreated back to their homeland after the fall of the [[Yuan Dynasty|Mongol Yuan Dynasty]], and once again delved into civil war. Although the Mongols became united once again during the reign of [[Mandukhai Khatun|Queen Mandukhai]] and [[Dayan Khan|Batmongkhe Dayan Khan]], in the 17th century they were annexed into the [[Qing Dynasty]].\n\n===Period under Qing Rule===\nOnce Mongolia was under the Qing, the Mongol Armies were used to defeat the Ming dynasty, helping to consolidate Manchu Rule. Mongols proved a useful ally in the war, lending their expertise as cavalry archers. During most of the Qing Dynasty time, the Mongols gave military assistance to the Manchus.<ref name=\"Bernard Hung-Kay Luk p.25\">Bernard Hung-Kay Luk, Amir Harrak-Contacts between cultures, Volume 4, p. 25</ref>\n\nWith the creation of the [[Eight Banners]], Banner Armies were broadly divided along ethnic lines, namely [[Manchu]] and [[Mongol]].\n\n=== Bogd Khanate (1911\u20131919) ===\nIn 1911, Outer Mongolia declared independence as the [[Outer Mongolia (1911\u20131919)|Bogd Khaanate]] under the [[Bogd Khan]]. This initial independence did not last, with [[Occupation of Mongolia|Mongolia being occupied successively]] by the Chinese [[Beiyang Government]], and [[Baron Ungern]]'s White Russian forces. The modern precursor to the Mongolian Armed Forces was placed, with men's conscription and a permanent military structure starting in 1912.<ref name=\"GeneralStaff\">{{cite web |url=http://gsmaf.gov.mn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13&Itemid=6&lang=mn |title=\u0417\u0425-\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u04af\u04af\u0445 |author=\u0417\u044d\u0432\u0441\u044d\u0433\u0442 \u0445\u04af\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0438\u043d \u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431 |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Mongolian People's Republic===\n{{main|Mongolian People's Army}}\nWith Independence lost again to foreign forces, the newly created [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] created a native communist army in 1920 under the leadership of [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]] in order to fight against Russian troops from the White movement and Chinese forces. The MPRP was aided by the [[Red Army]], which helped to secure the Mongolian People's Republic and remained in its territory until at least 1925. However, during the [[1932 armed uprising in Mongolia]] and the [[Soviet-Japanese border conflicts|initial Japanese border probes]] beginning in the mid-1930s, Soviet Red Army troops in Mongolia amounted to little more than instructors for the native army and as guards for diplomatic and trading installations.\n\n====Battles of Khalkhin Gol====\n{{See also|Battles of Khalkhin Gol}}\n[[File:SternGM.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Grigori Shtern]], [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] and [[Georgy Zhukov]] at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]].]]\n[[File:MNRA soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mongolian People's Army soldiers fight against Imperial Japanese soldiers. Khalkhin Gol, 1939.]]\nThe Battles of Khalkhin Gol began on 11 May 1939. A Mongolian cavalry unit of some 70\u201390 men had entered the disputed area in search of grazing for their horses.  On that day, Manchukuoan cavalry attacked the Mongolians and drove them back across the Khalkhin Gol. On 13 May, the Mongolian force returned in greater numbers and the Manchukoans were unable to dislodge them.\n\nOn 14 May, Lt. Col. [[Yaozo Azuma]] led the reconnaissance regiment of 23rd Infantry Division, supported by the 64th Infantry Regiment of the same division, under Colonel [[Takemitsu Yamagata]], into the territory and the Mongolians withdrew. Soviet and Mongolian troops returned to the disputed region, however, and Azuma's force again moved to evict them.  This time things turned out differently, as the Soviet\u2013Mongolian forces surrounded Azuma's force on 28 May and destroyed it.<ref>Drea, Edward J.

Soviet forces under the command of [[Georgy Zhukov]], together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars]].\n\nIn 1945, Mongolian forces participated in the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] under the command of the Red Army, among the last engagements of [[World War II]]. A Soviet\u2013Mongolian [[Cavalry mechanized group]] under [[Issa Pliyev]] took part as part of the Soviet [[Transbaikal Front]].<ref>http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/45-08-08/army_cav-mech.html {{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Mongolian troops numbered four cavalry divisions and three other regiments. During 1946\u20131948, the Mongolian People's Army successfully repelled attacks from the [[Kuomintang]]'s Hui regiment and their Kazakh allies in the border between Mongolia and Xinjiang. The attacks were propagated by the [[Ili Rebellion]], a Soviet-backed revolt by the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] against the Kuomintang Government of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]]. This little-known border dispute between Mongolia and the Republic of China became known as the [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]].\n\nThese engagements would be the last active battles the Mongolian Army would see, until after the democratic revolution.\n\n===After the Democratic Revolution===\n[[File:Military medical professionals from Mongolia, India, Canada, South Korea and the United States stand in formation at the cooperative health engagement and subject matter expert exchange closing ceremony for 130813-M-MG222-003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Military medical professionals from Mongolia, India, Canada, South Korea and the United States stand in formation at the cooperative health engagement and subject matter expert exchange closing ceremony for [[Khaan Quest]] 2013 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Aug. 13, 2013.]]\nMongolia [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia|underwent a democratic revolution in 1990]], ending the communist one-party state that had existed since the early 1920s.

In 2005/2006, Mongolian troops also served as part of the Belgian [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] contingent in [[Kosovo]]. From 2009 to 2010 Mongolian Armed Forces deployed its largest peace keeping mission to [[Chad]] and completed the mission successfully.  In 2011, the government decided to deploy its first fully self-sustained forces to the United Nations Mission [[UNMISS]] in [[South Sudan]].
