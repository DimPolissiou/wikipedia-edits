{"title_page": "Nested radical", "text_new": "In [[algebra]], a '''nested radical''' is a [[radical expression]] (one containing a square root sign, cube root sign, etc.) that contains (nests) another radical expression. Examples include\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}\\ },</math>\n\nwhich arises in discussing the [[pentagon|regular pentagon]], and more complicated ones such as\n\n:<math>\\sqrt[3]{2+\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt[3]{4}\\ }.</math>\n\n== Denesting==\n\nSome nested radicals can be rewritten in a form that is not nested. For example,\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{3+2\\sqrt{2}} = 1+\\sqrt{2}\\,,</math>\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{5+2\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3},</math>\n\n:<math>\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{2} - 1} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt[3]{2} + \\sqrt[3]{4}}{\\sqrt[3]{9}} \\,.</math>\n\nRewriting a nested radical in this way is called '''denesting'''. This is not always possible, and, even when possible, it is often difficult.\n\n==Two nested square roots==\nIn the case of two nested square roots, the following theorem completely solves the problem of denesting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Euler|first=Leonhard|title= Elements of algebra|publisher= Springer Science & Business Media|year= 2012|at=Chapter VIII}}</ref>\n\nIf {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are [[rational number]]s and {{mvar|c}} is not the square of a rational number, there are two rational numbers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} such that\n:<math>\\sqrt{a+ b \\sqrt{c}} = \\sqrt{x}\\pm\\sqrt{y}</math>\nif and only if <math>a^2-b^2c~</math> is the square of a rational number {{mvar|d}}.\n\nIf the nested radical is real, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are the two numbers\n:<math>\\frac{a+d}2~</math> and <math>~\\frac{a-d}2~,~</math> where <math>~d=\\sqrt{a^2-b^2c}~</math> is a rational number.\n\nIn particular, if {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are integers, then {{math|2''x''}} and {{math|2''y''}} are integers.\n\nThis result includes denestings of the form\n:<math>\\sqrt{a+ b \\sqrt{c}}=z\\pm\\sqrt{y}~,</math>\nas {{mvar|z}} may always be written <math>z=\\pm\\sqrt{z^2},</math> and at least one of the terms must be positive (because the left-hand side of the equation is positive).\n\nA more general denesting formula could have the form\n:<math>\\sqrt{a+ b \\sqrt{c}} = \\alpha+ \\beta\\sqrt{x}+\\gamma\\sqrt{y}+\\delta\\sqrt x\\sqrt y~.</math>\nHowever, [[Galois theory]] implies that either the left-hand side belongs to <math>\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt c),</math>  or it must be obtained by changing the sign of either <math>\\sqrt x,</math> <math>\\sqrt y,</math> or both. In the first case, this means that one can take {{math|1=''x'' = ''c''}} and <math>\\gamma=\\delta=0.</math> In the second case, <math>\\alpha</math> and another coefficient must be zero. If <math>\\beta=0,</math> one may rename {{math|''xy''}} as {{mvar|x}} for getting <math>\\delta=0.</math> Proceeding similarly if <math>\\alpha=0,</math> it results that one can suppose <math>\\alpha=\\delta=0.</math> This shows that the apparently more general denesting can always be reduced to the above one.\n\n''Proof'': By squaring, the equation \n:<math>\\sqrt{a+ b \\sqrt{c}} = \\sqrt{x}\\pm\\sqrt{y}</math>\nis equivalent with \n:<math>a+ b \\sqrt{c}=x+y\\pm 2\\sqrt{xy},</math>\nand, in the case of a minus in the right-hand side, \n:{{math|''{{abs|x}}'' \u2265 ''{{abs|y}}''}},\n(square roots are nonnegative by definition of the notation). As the inequality may always be satisfied by possibly exchanging {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, solving the first equation in {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is equivalent with solving  \n:<math>a+ b \\sqrt{c}=x+y\\pm 2\\sqrt{xy}.</math>\n\nThis equality implies that <math>\\sqrt{xy}</math> belongs to the [[quadratic field]] <math>\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt c).</math> In this field every element may be uniquely written <math>\\alpha +\\beta\\sqrt c,</math> with <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> being rational numbers. This implies that <math>\\pm 2\\sqrt{xy}</math> is not rational (otherwise the right-hand side of the equation would be rational; but the left-hand side is irrational). As {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} must be rational, the square of <math>\\pm 2\\sqrt{xy}</math> must be rational. This implies that <math>\\alpha=0</math> in the expression of <math>\\pm 2\\sqrt{xy}</math> as <math>\\alpha +\\beta\\sqrt c.</math> Thus\n:<math>a+ b \\sqrt{c}=x+y +\\beta\\sqrt{c}</math>\nfor some rational number <math>\\beta.</math>\nThe uniqueness of the decomposition over {{math|1}} and <math>\\sqrt c</math> implies thus that the considered equation is equivalent with\n:<math>a= x+y\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\pm 2\\sqrt{xy}=b\\sqrt c.</math>\nIt follows by [[Vieta's formulas]] that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} must be roots of the [[quadratic equation]]\n:<math>z^2-az+\\frac{b^2c}4 = 0~;</math>\nits <math>~\\Delta = a^2-b^2c = d^2 > 0~</math> (\u22600, otherwise {{mvar|c}} would be the square of {{mvar|a/b}}), hence {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} must be\n:<math>\\frac{a+\\sqrt{a^2-b^2c}}{2}~</math> and <math>~\\frac{a-\\sqrt{a^2-b^2c}}{2}~.</math>\nThus {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are rational if and only if <math>d=\\sqrt{a^2-b^2c}~</math> is a rational number.\n\nFor explicitly choosing the various signs, one must consider only positive real square roots, and thus assuming {{math|''c'' > 0}}. The equation <math>a^2=b^2c+d^2</math> shows that {{math|''{{abs|a}}'' > ''{{abs|b}}''{{sqrt|''c''}}}}. Thus, if the nested radical is real, and if denesting is possible, then {{math|''a'' > 0}}. Then, the two possible cases for the sign of {{mvar|b}} may be considered simultaneously, by assuming {{math|''b'' > 0}} and writing the solution\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sqrt{a+ b \\sqrt{c}}&=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{a+d}2}+\\sqrt{\\tfrac{a-d}2},\\\\\n\\sqrt{a- b \\sqrt{c}}&=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{a+d}2}-\\sqrt{\\tfrac{a-d}2}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Some identities of Ramanujan ==\n\n[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] demonstrated a number of curious identities involving nested radicals.

This approach can also be used to show that generally, if ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, then\n\n:<math> \\sqrt{n+\\sqrt{n+\\sqrt{n+\\sqrt{n+\\cdots}}}} = \\tfrac12\\left(1 +\n\\sqrt {1+4n}\\right) </math>\n\nand is the positive root of the equation ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. For ''n'' = 1, this root is the [[golden ratio]] \u03c6, approximately equal to 1.618.

Again, by realizing that the whole expression appears inside itself, we are left with the equation\n\n:<math> x = \\sqrt[3]{6+x}. </math>\n\nIf we solve this equation, we find that&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. More generally, we find that\n\n:<math> \\sqrt[3]{n+\\sqrt[3]{n+\\sqrt[3]{n+\\sqrt[3]{n+\\cdots}}}}</math>\n\nis the positive real root of the equation ''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for all&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0. For ''n'' = 1, this root is the [[plastic number]] ''\u03c1'', approximately equal to 1.3247.\n\nThe same procedure also works to get\n\n:<math> \\sqrt[3]{n-\\sqrt[3]{n-\\sqrt[3]{n-\\sqrt[3]{n-\\cdots}}}} </math>\n\nas the real root of the equation ''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for all ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1.\n\n=== Herschfeld's Convergence Theorem ===\nAn infinitely nested radical <math>\\sqrt{a_1 + \\sqrt{a_2 + \\dotsb}}</math> (where all <math>a_i</math> are [[nonnegative]]) converges if and only if there is some <math>M \\in \\mathbb R</math>  such that <math>M \\geq a_n^{2^{-n}}</math> for all <math>n</math>.\n\n==== Proof of if ====\nWe observe that the sequence in <math>n</math> given by <math>\\sqrt{a_1 + \\sqrt{a_2 + \\dotsc \\sqrt{a_n}}}</math> is monotonically increasing. Therefore if we exhibit an upper bound then the sequence must converge by the [[Monotone convergence theorem]]. We do this:\n\n<math>\\sqrt{a_1 + \\sqrt{a_2 + \\dotsb}} \\leq \\sqrt{M^{2^1} + \\sqrt{M^{2^2} + \\dotsb}} = M\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\dotsb}} = M\\phi</math> where <math>\\phi</math> is the [[golden ratio]].\n\n==== Proof of only if ====\nIf the sequence in <math>n</math> given by <math>a_n^{2^{-n}}</math> is unbounded then <math>\\sqrt{a_1 + \\sqrt{a_2 + \\dotsc \\sqrt{a_n}}}</math> is also unbounded.
