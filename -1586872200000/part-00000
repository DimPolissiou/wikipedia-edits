{"title_page": "Financial analyst", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2008}}\nA '''financial analyst''' is a person who performs [[financial analysis]] for external or internal financial clients as a core part of the job. \n\nThe role may alternatively be titled '''securities analyst''', '''research analyst''', '''equity analyst''', '''investment analyst''', or '''rating analyst'''.\n\n(The term \u201cfinancial analyst\u201d is not usually taken to include [[quantitative analyst]]s, or \u201cquants\u201d; typically, these are concerned with [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[fixed income analysis]], and focus on [[mathematical modeling]] as opposed to accounting-related analytics.)\n\n==Job==\nFinancial analysts are employed by [[mutual fund|mutual-]] and [[pension fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, securities firms, banks, [[investment bank]]s, insurance companies, and other businesses, helping these companies or their clients make investment decisions. \nCorporate finance analysts (additionally) perform budget and cost modelling as part of their responsibilities;\n[[Credit analyst|credit analysis]] is likewise a distinct area.\n\nFinancial analysts invariably use [[spreadsheet]]s (and [[statistical software]] packages) to analyze financial data, spot trends, and develop forecasts; see [[Financial modeling#Accounting|Financial modeling]].  The analyst often also meets with company officials to gain a better insight into a company's prospects and to determine the company's managerial effectiveness.\n\n===Securities firms===\n{{Main|Securities research}}\nIn a stock brokerage house or investment bank, the analyst will read company financial statements and analyze commodity prices, sales, costs, expenses, and tax rates in order to [[business valuation|determine a company's value]] and [[financial forecast|project future earnings]]. On the basis of their results, they [[research report|write reports]] and make presentations, usually making recommendations to buy or sell a particular investment or security.\n\nTypically, at the end of the assessment, an analyst would provide a rating recommending or investment action: to buy, sell, or hold the security. Senior analysts may actually make the decision to buy or sell for the company or client if they are the ones responsible for managing the assets. Other, \"junior\" analysts use the data to model and measure the financial risks associated with making a particular investment decision. See [[Securities research#Career path]].\n\nUsually, financial analysts study an entire industry ([[Securities research#Analyst specialization|\"sector specialist\"]]), assessing current trends in business practices, products, and industry competition. They must keep abreast of new regulations or policies that may affect the industry, as well as monitor the economy to determine its effect on earnings.\nA 1999 paper by Ezra Zuckermann found that, as equity analysts divide securities by discrete sectors, companies which fall outside or across multiple sectors are punished in the ratings of analysts <ref>{{cite journal|jstor=10.1086/210178|title=The Categorical Imperative: Securities Analysts and the Illegitimacy Discount|first=Ezra W.|last=Zuckerman|date=18 May 1999|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=104|issue=5|pages=1398\u20131438|doi=10.1086/210178|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6b733e78175a89ca84b00ad4d4052eabc09f8237}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts are generally divided into  [[Buy-side analyst|'buy-side']] and [[Buy-side analyst|'sell-side']].   \nA buy-side analyst,  such as a fund manager, works for a company which buys and holds stocks itself, on the analyst's recommendation. \nA sell-side analyst's work is not used by its employer to invest directly, rather it is sold either for money or for other benefits by the employer to buy-side organisations. Sell-side research is often used as 'soft money' rather than sold directly, for example provided to preferred clients in return for business. [[research report|Writing reports]] or notes expressing opinions is always a part of \"sell-side\" (brokerage) analyst job and is often not required for \"buy-side\" (investment firms) analysts. \nIt is sometimes used to promote the companies being researched when the sell-side has some other interest in them, as a form of marketing, which can lead to conflicts of interest.  \nThe buy-side is sometimes considered more prestigious, professional, and scholarly, while the sell-side may be higher-paid and more like a sales and marketing role.  \nIt is common to begin careers on the sell-side at large banks then move to the buy-side at a fund.\n\nTraditionally, analysts use [[fundamental analysis]] principles but [[technical analysis]] and tactical evaluation of the market environment are also routine. Analysts obtain information by studying public records and filings by the company, as well as by participating in public [[conference calls]] where they can ask direct questions to the management. Additional information can be also received in small group or one-on-one meetings with senior members of management teams. However, in many markets such information gathering became difficult and potentially illegal due to legislative changes brought upon by corporate scandals in the early 2000s. One example is [[Regulation FD]] (Fair Disclosure) in the United States. Many other developed countries also adopted similar rules.\n\nAnalyst performance is ranked by a range of services such as StarMine owned by [[Thomson Reuters]] or Institutional Investor magazine. \nResearch by [[Numis]] found that small companies with the most analyst coverage outperformed peers by 2.5 per cent \u2014 while those with low coverage underperformed by 0.7 per cent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/473a37a8-1720-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n===Other areas===\nFinancial analysts in the [[investment banking]] departments of securities or banking firms often work in teams, analyzing the future prospects of companies that want to [[initial public offering |sell shares to the public for the first time]]; this task is often identical to that of a securities analyst. \nOn this basis, they will then make presentations to prospective investors (\u201c[[financial roadshows|roadshows]]\u201d) about the merits of investing in the new company. \nAn additional component of the IB role: analysts ensure that all forms and written materials necessary for compliance with [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] regulations are accurate and complete. \nIB analysts similarly work in [[mergers and acquisitions]] departments, preparing analyses on the costs and benefits of a proposed merger or takeover; here there are both [[buy-side analyst|buy-side-]] and [[sell-side analyst]]s.\n\n[[Corporate finance]] analysts assist in long term [[capital budgeting]] and [[Corporate finance#Investment and project valuation|\"project\" valuation]], \nand short term [[working capital management]], including tasks such as [[profitability analysis]].\nThey are also typically involved with [[budgeting]] and planning (and corporate strategy), their models forming the basis for [[financial forecast]]ing, [[scenario analysis]] and optimization.\nThe latter, will often extend to involvement with [[dividend policy]], and [[capital structure]] optimization.\n\nThere are several analyst roles related to [[credit risk]], macro or micro. \n[[ratings agency|Ratings analysts]] (who are often employees of [[ratings agencies]]), evaluate the ability of companies or governments that issue bonds to repay their debt. On the basis of their evaluation, a management team [[Bond credit rating|assigns a rating]] to a company's or government's bonds. \nFinancial analysts employed in [[Commercial lender|commercial lending]]{{dn|date=December 2019}} perform \"[[balance sheet|balance sheet analysis]]\", examining the [[financial statements|audited financial statements]] and corollary data in order to assess lending risks.  \nIn [[retail banking]], [[credit analyst]]s build models to determine an applicant's creditworthyness, assign an initial [[credit score]], and monitor this and the loan on an ongoing basis. \nIn the latter two roles, [[Impairment (financial reporting)|impairment-]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provision]]-modelling are often a prominent deliverable.\n\nSome financial analysts, specialize as \"[[accounting analyst]]s\"; they will collect industry data (mainly balance sheet, income statement and capital adequacy in banking sector), merger and acquisition history and financial news for their clients. They then typically \u201cstandardize\u201c the different companies' data, facilitating  [[peer group analysis]]: the main objective here is to enable their clients to make better decisions about the investment across different regions. They also provide the abundance of [[financial ratio]]s calculated from the data gathered from financial statements, and possibly other sources.\n\n==Qualification==\nIn general, a [[Business education#Undergraduate education|Bachelor's degree]] in Accounting/Finance/Economics is a minimum requirement for an entry or junior role\n(as well as proficiency in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] - see [[Financial modeling#Accounting]]). \nOften, more senior analysts are expected to then earn an [[MBA]], having gained 2\u20133 years experience in the junior role.  \nIncreasingly, it is preferred that, even to enter, analysts hold a [[Master of Finance|master's degree in finance]].\nFor credit related roles, an actuarial qualification, or the [[Financial risk management#Financial risk manager|FRM]] / [[professional risk manager|PRM]] is often required. \nIn corporate roles, an accounting qualification - the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] or [[Chartered accountant|CA]] - is typically a prerequisite.\n\nIn securities and IB roles, it is lately preferred that, similarly, even to enter, analysts earn a master's  and / or the [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA designation]], with the MBA still common at senior levels.\nThere are also many regulatory requirements. For example, in the United States, sell-side or Wall Street research analysts must register with the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA). In addition to passing the [[General Securities Representative Exam]], candidates must pass the ''Research Analyst Examination'' ([[List of securities examinations#United States of America|series 86/87]]) in order to publish research for the purpose of selling or promoting publicly traded securities.\n\nFor sector-specialists - with approx. 5 years industry experience - less weight is placed on finance qualifications, as a relevant advanced degree or qualification in the field is often critical. (They will later be encouraged to earn the CFA / MBA.) \nFor example, [[Valuation (finance)#Valuing financial service firms|valuing financial service firms]] and  [[Valuation (finance)#Valuation of mining projects|valuing mining projects]] particularly, requires specialized knowledge re. [[Business valuation standard|valuation-]], regulatory-, and [[accounting standard]]s; and, respectively, qualifications in [[actuarial science]], and [[mining engineering]] / [[geologist|geology]] will be required.\n[[Outline of industry|Other sectors]] may similarly require advanced technical knowledge; e.g. in [[pharmacy]] / [[life sciences]] for [[:Category:Life sciences industry|\"bio-tech\"]], in [[electronic engineering]] for areas in \"[[high tech]]\". \nMost large teams will also include a CPA or CA in a dedicated technical role.  (In [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]], the CA qualification often remains sufficient to access (junior) analyst roles.)\n\n== Compensation ==\nThe job title is a broad one. As of 2012, the median pay in the United States was $76,950 per year according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm Financial Analysts]. BLS.</ref> SumZero found that professionals in the [[hedge fund]] industry average $409,826 per year including bonus and deferred pay.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-people-make-at-hedge-funds-2014-4 This Is How Much The Average Person Can Make Working For A Hedge Fund]. Business Insider.</ref>\n\n==Controversies about financing==\nAnalyst recommendations on stocks owned by firms employing them may be seen as potentially biased.\n\nThe research department sometimes doesn't have the ability to bring in enough money to be a self-sustaining research company. The research analysts' department is therefore sometimes part of the [[marketing department]] of an [[investment bank]], [[brokerage]], or [[investment advisory]] firm.\n\nSince 2002 there has been extra effort to overcome perceived [[conflicts of interest]] between the investment part of the firm and the public and client research part of the firm (see [[accounting scandals]]). For example, research firms are sometimes separated into two categories, brokerage and independent. Independent researchers are not part of an investment firm and so don't have the same incentive to issue overly favorable views on companies. But this might not be sufficient to avoid all conflicts of interest. In Europe, the [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004]] and subsequent related legislation has in part been an attempt to clarify the exact remit of equity analysts.\n\nDebate still exists about the way sell-side analysts are paid. Usually brokerage fees pay for their research. But this creates a temptation for analysts to act as stock sellers and to lure investors into \"overtrading\".\n\nSome consider that it would be sounder if investors had to pay for financial research separately and directly to fully independent research firms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Accounting analyst]]\n*[[Credit analyst]]\n*[[Financial services]]\n*[[Quantitative analyst]]\n*[[Research report]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Leon Wansleben (2012) 'Financial Analysts' In: K.

Since the industrial revolution there has been a consistent theme of rivalry between the two cities based around economic and industrial competition. Manchester through to the 18th century was the far more populous city, and held a position of significance and notability as representative of the north. By the late 18th century, Liverpool had grown as a major sea port \u2013 critical to the growth and success of the northern cotton mills. Over the next century, Liverpool grew to supersede Manchester and throughout the late 19th and early 20th century was often described as the British Empire's [[Second city of the United Kingdom|second city]].<ref name=BBCScousevsManc/> The links between the two cities were strengthened with the construction of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], and the world\u2019s first inter-city railway, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], for the transport of raw materials inland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester to Liverpool: the first inter-city railway |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8165000/8165208.stm |accessdate=1 July 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arms of the City of Manchester.svg|thumb|The Manchester coat of arms formed the foundation of the original Manchester United badge]]\nThe construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], funded by Manchester merchants, was opposed by Liverpool politicians and bred resentment between the two cities. Tension between working class Liverpool dockers and labourers in Manchester was heightened after its completion in 1894, just three months prior to the first meeting between Liverpool and Newton Heath in a play-off match that would see Newton Heath relegated to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitten |first1=Andy |title=Mad for It |year=2008 |publisher=HarperSport |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728080-3 |pages=6\u20137 }}</ref>\n\nToday, the crests of both the city of Manchester and Manchester United include stylised ships representing the Manchester Ship Canal and Manchester's trade roots. The ship is also included on the crest of many other Mancunian institutions such as [[Manchester City Council]] and rivals [[Manchester City F.C.]]\n\nPost-war shifts in economic ties, reliance on regional coal, and shifts in transatlantic trade patterns caused by the growth of Asian labour markets caused the gradual decline of British manufacturing. While the city of Liverpool suffered the loss of its primary source of income to southern port cities, Manchester maintained some of its manufacturing heritage. This reversal of fortunes happened against the backdrop of shifting political backgrounds and significant events in British culture and society in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nBoth cities were part of the county of [[Lancashire]] until March 1974, upon the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Since then, Liverpool and Manchester each respectively anchor the neighbouring [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] of [[Merseyside]] and [[Greater Manchester]].\n\nThe two cities continue to be strong regional rivals, vying for influence of surrounding areas. Their continued importance to the UK economy has been reflected with the awarding of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] to Manchester, while Liverpool was awarded the title of 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] as part of its ongoing regeneration.\n\nMore recent projects by [[Peel Ports]] have sought to re-establish the economic links between the Port of Liverpool and Port of Manchester, including re-developing trade links via the Manchester Ship Canal.\n\n==Football rivals==\n{{see also|List of Liverpool F.C. seasons|List of Manchester United F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Formation to 1945===\n[[File:ManUnited1905-1906.jpg|thumb|The Manchester United team at the start of the 1905\u201306 season.|alt=A black-and-white photo of a football team.

It was during this period, in the late 70s and early 80s, that the modern day rivalry between the two clubs truly began to get heated. According to football sociologist John Williams, United had developed a \"glamour and media profile\" but didn't have the success to match it and Liverpool fans felt the Red Devils were \"media darlings who got far too much publicity\". There was a perception in Liverpool that their hugely successful but \"professional\" and \"workmanlike\" teams were always somehow in the shadow of the stars at Old Trafford. This led to a derisory United nickname in Liverpool: \"The Glams\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30419684|title=Man Utd v Liverpool: A strange kind of sporting love affair?|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\n===1992\u2013present===\nManchester United's 26-year spell without a league title has been replicated by Liverpool since 1990, when they clinched their last league title.

Liverpool built their dominance on a dynasty known as the [[The Boot Room|Anfield Boot Room]]. The boot room itself was where strategy for future matches was planned, however, it became a breeding ground for future Liverpool managers following the arrival of [[Bill Shankly]] in 1959. The original members were Shankly himself, [[Bob Paisley]], [[Joe Fagan]] and [[Reuben Bennett]], although the likes of [[Kenny Dalglish]] joined later on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1418093.stm|title=The legacy of the boot room|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Shankly's retirement in 1974, having secured eight trophies in 15 years, Bob Paisley stepped into the vacant manager's position and amassed 20 trophies in 9 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-managers/bob-paisley|title=Bob Paisley|website=liverpoolfc.com|publisher=Liverpool FC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041303/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-managers/bob-paisley|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Following his retirement, Joe Fagan took over and in the first of two seasons at the club, won a treble of trophies. Kenny Dalglish, while not an original member, was accepted into the group as the next in line for the role of manager, and he combined it with his playing duties to win Liverpool 10 trophies.

Robson then pulled a goal back for United, and with 12 minutes remaining fellow midfielder [[Gordon Strachan]] equalised to force a 3\u20133 draw.<ref name=\"insda\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/classic-liverpool-v-manchester-united-encounters-1807274.html?action=Gallery |title=Classic Liverpool v Manchester United encounters |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Simon |last=Rice |date=4 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Other notable games===\nOn 4 January 1994, in the second season of the new [[FA Premier League]], United took a 3\u20130 lead at Anfield in the opening 25 minutes with goals from [[Steve Bruce]], [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Denis Irwin]]. Liverpool managed to claw back to draw 3\u20133 with two goals from [[Nigel Clough]] and another from [[Neil Ruddock]]. It was one of the last games in charge of Liverpool for manager [[Graeme Souness]], who had resigned by the end of the month.<ref name=\"insda\"/>\n\nOn 1 October 1995, United's [[Eric Cantona]] made his comeback to the side after serving an eight-month suspension for attacking a spectator in a game against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. His comeback game was against Liverpool in the Premier League at Old Trafford. United took an early lead through [[Nicky Butt]], only for Liverpool's [[Robbie Fowler]] to score twice and give the visitors a 2\u20131 lead. However, United were awarded a penalty in the 71st minute and Cantona converted it successfully, forcing a 2\u20132 draw.<ref name=\"insda\"/> At the end of the season, the two sides met again at Wembley for the [[1996 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]]. The game stayed goalless until the 85th minute, when Liverpool conceded a corner, which [[David Beckham]] swung into the box to be cleared by [[David James (footballer)|David James]], only for Eric Cantona to fire home United's winner.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4694012.stm |website=BBC Sport |first=Ian |last=Wilkerson |title=FA Cup flashback |date=16 February 2006}}</ref> In March 2003, the two clubs once again met in a cup final, this time in the [[2003 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], with Liverpool lifting the trophy after goals from [[Steven Gerrard]] and [[Michael Owen]] gave them a 2\u20130 win.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liverpool lift Worthington Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/2811805.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=2 March 2003 |accessdate=22 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:2009-3-14 ManUtd vs LFC Red Card Vidic.JPG|thumb|[[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]] of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was sent off in the game against Liverpool on 14 March 2009.]]\nOn 14 March 2009, the two sides met at Old Trafford in the Premier League. United were ahead at the top of the league and Liverpool were looking to make a late run to the title which had eluded them since 1990. United went ahead in the 23rd minute with a [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] penalty, but [[Fernando Torres]] equalised five minutes later for Liverpool, and a [[Steven Gerrard]] penalty just before half-time put Liverpool in the lead. United had [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]] sent off in the 76th minute, and their misery was swiftly compounded by late goals from [[F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio]] and finally [[Andrea Dossena]], condemning them to a 4\u20131 defeat, their heaviest at Old Trafford in any competition for 17 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7922069.stm |website=BBC Sport |title=Man Utd

Since the industrial revolution there has been a consistent theme of rivalry between the two cities based around economic and industrial competition. Manchester through to the 18th century was the far more populous city, and held a position of significance and notability as representative of the north. By the late 18th century, Liverpool had grown as a major sea port \u2013 critical to the growth and success of the northern cotton mills. Over the next century, Liverpool grew to supersede Manchester and throughout the late 19th and early 20th century was often described as the British Empire's [[Second city of the United Kingdom|second city]].<ref name=BBCScousevsManc/> The links between the two cities were strengthened with the construction of the [[Bridgewater Canal]], the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], and the world\u2019s first inter-city railway, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], for the transport of raw materials inland.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester to Liverpool: the first inter-city railway |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8165000/8165208.stm |accessdate=1 July 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arms of the City of Manchester.svg|thumb|The Manchester coat of arms formed the foundation of the original Manchester United badge]]\nThe construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], funded by Manchester merchants, was opposed by Liverpool politicians and bred resentment between the two cities. Tension between working class Liverpool dockers and labourers in Manchester was heightened after its completion in 1894, just three months prior to the first meeting between Liverpool and Newton Heath in a play-off match that would see Newton Heath relegated to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitten |first1=Andy |title=Mad for It |year=2008 |publisher=HarperSport |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-728080-3 |pages=6\u20137 }}</ref>\n\nToday, the crests of both the city of Manchester and Manchester United include stylised ships representing the Manchester Ship Canal and Manchester's trade roots. The ship is also included on the crest of many other Mancunian institutions such as [[Manchester City Council]] and rivals [[Manchester City F.C.]]\n\nPost-war shifts in economic ties, reliance on regional coal, and shifts in transatlantic trade patterns caused by the growth of Asian labour markets caused the gradual decline of British manufacturing. While the city of Liverpool suffered the loss of its primary source of income to southern port cities, Manchester maintained some of its manufacturing heritage. This reversal of fortunes happened against the backdrop of shifting political backgrounds and significant events in British culture and society in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nBoth cities were part of the county of [[Lancashire]] until March 1974, upon the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Since then, Liverpool and Manchester each respectively anchor the neighbouring [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] of [[Merseyside]] and [[Greater Manchester]].\n\nThe two cities continue to be strong regional rivals, vying for influence of surrounding areas. Their continued importance to the UK economy has been reflected with the awarding of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] to Manchester, while Liverpool was awarded the title of 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] as part of its ongoing regeneration.\n\nMore recent projects by [[Peel Ports]] have sought to re-establish the economic links between the Port of Liverpool and Port of Manchester, including re-developing trade links via the Manchester Ship Canal.\n\n==Football rivals==\n{{see also|List of Liverpool F.C. seasons|List of Manchester United F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Formation to 1945===\n[[File:ManUnited1905-1906.jpg|thumb|The Manchester United team at the start of the 1905\u201306 season.|alt=A black-and-white photo of a football team.

There was a perception in Liverpool that their hugely successful but \"professional\" and \"workmanlike\" teams were always somehow in the shadow of the stars at Old Trafford.

Liverpool built their dominance on a dynasty known as the [[The Boot Room|Anfield Boot Room]]. The boot room itself was where strategy for future matches was planned, however, it became a breeding ground for future Liverpool managers following the arrival of [[Bill Shankly]] in 1959.

Kenny Dalglish, while not an original member, was accepted into the group as the next in line for the role of manager, and he combined it with his playing duties to win Liverpool 10 trophies. The boot room connection was finally broken in 1991, 32 years after Shankly's arrival, with the appointment of [[Graeme Souness]], who actually demolished the boot room itself to make way for a press room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lessons-manchester-united-learn-liverpools-6480610|title=The lessons for Manchester United to learn from Liverpool's demise \u2013 Manchester Evening News|first=Mike|last=Keegan|date=8 January 2014|work=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> It did still manage to produce a final Liverpool manager in [[Roy Evans]], who won the League Cup, but upon his resignation in 1998, the era was over.\n\nIn contrast, Manchester United have succeeded thanks to the services of three extraordinary men, all decades apart, without the need for continuity and sustained success beyond each man's departure.

He also recorded part of their fifth album, recorded in 1973, but the album was shelved until it was finally completed and released as ''5'' in 2004.\n\n==Ducks Deluxe==\n{{main|Ducks Deluxe}}\nIn February 1972 Tyla formed Ducks Deluxe, initially with Help Yourself's bassist, the late [[Ken Whaley]], guitarist [[Martin Belmont]] and percussionist Michael Cousins. Cousins was replaced by drummer [[Tim Roper]] and Nick Garvey also joined. Ducks Deluxe were one of the founding acts of the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|Pub rock]] circuit, with more up-tempo, energetic performances than many other pub rock acts.  They recorded three albums, one ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]''<ref name=Feenstra /> and two [[List of Peel Sessions|Peel Sessions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Peel Sessions recorded by Ducks Deluxe|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/d/ducksdeluxe/|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> Ducks Deluxe split in 1975.\n\n==Tyla Gang==\nFollowing the break-up of Ducks Deluxe, Sean Tyla formed Tyla Gang in late autumn of 1975 with his brother Gary, Phil Nedin (drums) and Peter O'Sullivan (bass) from Welsh band Jack Straw. In the spring of 76, the late Richard Treece from Help Yourself joined the band. Within a few months Gary Tyler and Treece left the band and Welshman Tweke Lewis, formerly of [[Man (band)|Man]], became the new guitarist. They went into Pebble Beach studio in Worthing, and under the guidance of producer Tony Platt recorded 6 tracks including \"Suicide jockey\" and \"Cannons of the Boogie Night\" as well as \"Styrofoam\" and \"Texas chainsaw massacre booogie\".

This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017.

Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.<ref name=\"WritingBigWeek\" /> As promotion for ''The Avengers'', Marvel released an official [[infographic]] detailing this timeline in May 2012.<ref name=\"TimelineInfographic\" />\n\nWanting to simplify the in-universe timeline,<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to ''The Avengers'': ''Iron Man 3'' takes place about six months later, during Christmas;<ref name=\"IM3TimeFrame\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Thor: The Dark World'' is set one year later;<ref name=\"ThorTDWSynopsis1\" /> and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' is two years after.<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'' ended the phase in 2015,<ref name=\"THRAvengers2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AntManReleaseDate\" /> with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\"/> For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so ''Captain America: Civil War'' begins a year after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" /> with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set two years after that.<ref name=\"CWIWTimeline\" /> However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> with ''Black Panther'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' respectively beginning a week and several months after ''Civil War'';<ref name=\"BPProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"SMHTimeline\" /> ''Thor: Ragnarok'' beginning four years after ''The Dark World'' and two years after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokSDCC\" /> around the same time as ''Civil War'' and ''Homecoming'';<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' also set two years after ''Civil War'' and shortly before ''Infinity War'';<ref name=\"AMWTimeline\" /> and both ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel ''Vol. 2'' being explicitly set in 2014,<ref name=\"GotGTimeline\" /><ref name=\"GotG2Timeline2\" /> which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between ''Vol. 2'' and ''Infinity War'', though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.<ref name=\"GuardiansIWFourYears\" />\n\nWhen ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017.

Presented by [[Ant & Dec]] and developed by [[Simon Cowell]], ''Red or Black?'' is the most expensive game show in television history, with a \u00a315&nbsp;million budget.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn each round, contestants choose red or black, with those that choose the incorrect colour being eliminated. During the first series, four finalists guessed the colour correctly in the final round and became millionaires. Over 100,000 members of the public applied to be on the show, with the numbers being reduced down to a different final eight contestants per live show each night for seven nights. Whilst most rounds varied, there were two standard rounds in each live final: \"Duel\" where the final two contestants went head to head, and the final round where the winner chose a colour on a giant wheel similar to that used in [[roulette]]. Celebrities including [[Jedward]], [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[One Direction]] were involved in the rounds of the show where contestants must choose either red or black in order to pass to the next round, while the show has filmed on locations such as [[Battersea Power Station]] and the set of ''[[Coronation Street]]''.\n\n''Red or Black?'' was commissioned for a second series,<ref>{{cite web |title=Red or Black gets second spin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/red-or-black-gets-second-spin/5039171.article |accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=12 March 2012}}</ref> which featured the format having been revamped significantly. While the first series featured six pre-recorded rounds in several different locations and four live rounds, the second series featured six pre-recorded rounds that take place in either the ''Red or Black?'' Arena or in the studio. Celebrities such as [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Jonathan Ross]] and [[Little Mix]] were involved in the rounds for this series.\n\nThe show is a joint production between [[Syco TV]] and [[ITV Studios]], and was initially broadcast on ITV nightly over the course of seven nights from Saturday to the following Saturday, with the exception of the Tuesday night. The show also featured several Syco-related music acts. Sponsorship for the first series was initially targeted at National Lottery operator [[Camelot Group]], but eventually went with Jackpotjoy owner [[Gamesys]] and [[Domino's Pizza]]. The second series was sponsored by controversial loans site [[wonga.com]].\n\nIn the week where the first series of ''Red or Black?'' aired, ITV gained a much larger audience share than it had in the week directly previous, where it had been beaten by [[BBC One]] on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the \u00a31m prize, had a criminal record. This led to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also a major factor in the pre-recording of series 2.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Production==\nAn initial pilot of the show was ordered in 2003 by ITV, from production company [[FremantleMedia]], and was commissioned by [[Claudia Rosencrantz]], who was the controller of entertainment at ITV at the time.

In each of the first three rounds, the eight contestants watch a series of stunts, sporting challenges or performances. They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have their powers of observation tested. Either way, the contestants must strike their buzzer and pick either red or black.\n\nThe first game takes place in the ''Red or Black?'' arena and subsequent games are held in the studio. After the first three rounds, the four players with the highest scores will move on to Part 2. If a tie occurs, the two or more players will play a tiebreaker round, \"Power Bar\", to decide who will move onto the second show.\n\nThe four remaining contestants participate in the next round, which involves celebrities (often singers). Then, the final two players will move on to the \"Duel\", played as it was during the first series, with the exception that the randomisation of each segment's colours is now shown briefly before being covered; and the game board now consists of 10 segments instead of 8. The competing pair will have to memorise the position of the jumbled up segments, then take it in turns to find their colour. The first to have all five of their colour revealed is the winner and advances to the new final round, \"The Vortex\".\n\nThe Vortex is \"a true test of skill, nerve and judgment\". It consists of a \"mini [[velodrome]]\" which flashes between red and black at a constant rate. The aim is to watch the sequence and adjust the power of the launcher, which will fire a ball into The Vortex. If the balls lands in the End Zone in the contestant's chosen colour, they win the jackpot (starting at \u00a3500,000), or else it will increase by \u00a3500,000 for the next show.\n\n====Rounds====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Presented by [[Ant & Dec]] and developed by [[Simon Cowell]], ''Red or Black?'' is the most expensive game show in television history, with a \u00a315&nbsp;million budget.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn each round, contestants choose red or black, with those that choose the incorrect colour being eliminated. During the first series, four finalists guessed the colour correctly in the final round and became millionaires. Over 100,000 members of the public applied to be on the show, with the numbers being reduced down to a different final eight contestants per live show each night for seven nights. Whilst most rounds varied, there were two standard rounds in each live final: \"Duel\" where the final two contestants went head to head, and the final round where the winner chose a colour on a giant wheel similar to that used in [[roulette]]. Celebrities including [[Jedward]], [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[One Direction]] were involved in the rounds of the show where contestants must choose either red or black in order to pass to the next round, while the show has filmed on locations such as [[Battersea Power Station]] and the set of ''[[Coronation Street]]''.\n\n''Red or Black?'' was commissioned for a second series,<ref>{{cite web |title=Red or Black gets second spin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/red-or-black-gets-second-spin/5039171.article |accessdate=7 June 2012 |date=12 March 2012}}</ref> which featured the format having been revamped significantly. While the first series featured six pre-recorded rounds in several different locations and four live rounds, the second series featured six pre-recorded rounds that take place in either the ''Red or Black?'' Arena or in the studio. Celebrities such as [[Carol Vorderman]], [[Jonathan Ross]] and [[Little Mix]] were involved in the rounds for this series.\n\nThe show is a joint production between [[Syco TV]] and [[ITV Studios]], and was initially broadcast on ITV nightly over the course of seven nights from Saturday to the following Saturday, with the exception of the Tuesday night. The show also featured several Syco-related music acts. Sponsorship for the first series was initially targeted at National Lottery operator [[Camelot Group]], but eventually went with Jackpotjoy owner [[Gamesys]] and [[Domino's Pizza]]. The second series was sponsored by controversial loans site [[wonga.com]].\n\nIn the week where the first series of ''Red or Black?'' aired, ITV gained a much larger audience share than it had in the week directly previous, where it had been beaten by [[BBC One]] on six out of seven nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the \u00a31m prize, had a criminal record. This led to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also a major factor in the pre-recording of series 2.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Production==\nAn initial pilot of the show was ordered in 2003 by ITV, from production company [[FremantleMedia]], and was commissioned by [[Claudia Rosencrantz]], who was the controller of entertainment at ITV at the time. It was presented by [[Brian Conley]], but was not broadcast; a series was not produced.

They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have their powers of observation tested. Either way, the contestants must strike their buzzer and pick either red or black.\n\nThe first game takes place in the ''Red or Black?'' arena and subsequent games are held in the studio. After the first three rounds, the four players with the highest scores will move on to Part 2. If a tie occurs, the two or more players will play a tiebreaker round, \"Power Bar\", to decide who will move onto the second show.\n\nThe four remaining contestants participate in the next round, which involves celebrities (often singers). Then, the final two players will move on to the \"Duel\", played as it was during the first series, with the exception that the randomisation of each segment's colours is now shown briefly before being covered; and the game board now consists of 10 segments instead of 8. The competing pair will have to memorise the position of the jumbled up segments, then take it in turns to find their colour. The first to have all five of their colour revealed is the winner and advances to the new final round, \"The Vortex\".\n\nThe Vortex is \"a true test of skill, nerve and judgment\". It consists of a \"mini [[velodrome]]\" which flashes between red and black at a constant rate. The aim is to watch the sequence and adjust the power of the launcher, which will fire a ball into The Vortex. If the balls lands in the End Zone in the contestant's chosen colour, they win the jackpot (starting at \u00a3500,000), or else it will increase by \u00a3500,000 for the next show.\n\n====Rounds====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
