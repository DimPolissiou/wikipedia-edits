On arrival, she becomes frightened by a spooked steer, and is \"rescued\" by the Virginian ([[Joel McCrea]]), only to discover the animal is so mild, it is a little girl's pet. As a result, she takes a strong dislike to the cowboy. He, on the other hand, is smitten with her. When Trampas ([[Brian Donlevy]]) voices his scurrilous speculation as to why she came west, the Virginian confronts him and forces him, at gunpoint, to take it back. \n \nMr. and Mrs. Taylor ([[Henry O'Neill]] and [[Fay Bainter]]) put Molly up in their old home. The Virginian starts courting her, much against her will initially. Steve Andrews ([[Sonny Tufts]]), a friend the Virginian has not seen in three years, is also interested in her. Eventually, she warms to the Virginian, but her feelings for him are not as strong and certain as his are for her.\n\nMeanwhile, families are being driven away by the depredations of cattle rustlers. The Virginian suspects Trampas is the ringleader, but has no proof. When he sees Steve becoming friendly to Trampas, he warns his easygoing friend to keep better company. When he catches Steve with one of Judge Henry's calves, applying Trampas's brand on the pretext of branding a \"stray,\" the Virginian warns Steve to choose wisely what course he wants his life to take because he will not cover up any rustling activities.\n\nBefore setting out on a long cattle drive, the Virginian tells Molly she will have to decide by the time he returns whether they have a future together. On the trail, Trampas and his men start a stampede, using the distraction to steal a couple of hundred animals. Afterward, the Virginian fears that Steve has been killed, but he in fact is working with Trampas.\n\nJudge Henry (an uncredited [[Minor Watson]]), whose cattle were taken, persuades the Virginian to lead a posse. When they find the rustlers, one is killed when he tries to draw his gun, and two others surrender. The Virginian catches Steve as he is sneaking away; Steve says no one would know if his friend were to let him go, but the Virginian takes him back to join the others. Trampas, however, gets away. The next day, the three rustlers are lynched.\n\nWhen the Virginian goes after Trampas, he is shot in the back. Molly tends him during the months of recovery. However, when she learns that he had to hang his own friend, she decides to return east. Andy (an uncredited [[James Burke (actor)|James Burke]]), the stagecoach driver, makes her see that she is in love with the Virginian. She finally agrees to marry the cowboy.\n\nJust before their wedding, Trampas shows up to settle matters with the Virginian, telling him to leave town by sundown or else. Molly pleads with her fiance to do just that, but the Virginian has no choice. He arms himself with the revolver Steve had left him, and the two men stalk each other. Trampas spots the Virginian first, and is about to ambush him, when he startles a horse. Warned, the Virginian manages to kill Trampas.

{"title_page": "Group theory", "text_new": "{{hatnote|This article covers advanced notions. For basic topics, see [[Group (mathematics)]].}}\n{{for|group theory in social sciences|social group}}\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|The popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]] has been used as an illustration of [[permutation group]]s. See [[Rubik's Cube group]].]]\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], '''group theory''' studies the [[algebraic structure]]s known as [[group (mathematics)|groups]].  \nThe concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s and [[axiom]]s. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. [[Linear algebraic group]]s and [[Lie group]]s are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.\n\nVarious physical systems, such as [[crystal]]s and the [[hydrogen atom]], may be modelled by [[symmetry group]]s. Thus group theory and the closely related [[representation theory]] have many important applications in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[materials science]]. Group theory is also central to [[public key cryptography]].\n\nOne of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century<ref>* Elwes, Richard, \"[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups],\" ''Plus Magazine'', Issue 41, December 2006.</ref> was the collaborative effort, taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980, that culminated in a complete [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\n==Main classes of groups==\n{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}\n\nThe range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from [[Finite set|finite]] [[permutation group]]s and special examples of [[matrix group]]s to abstract groups that may be specified through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by [[Generating set of a group|generators]] and [[Binary relation|relations]].\n\n===Permutation groups===\nThe first [[Class (set theory)|class]] of groups to undergo a systematic study was [[permutation group]]s. Given any set ''X'' and a collection ''G'' of [[bijection]]s of ''X'' into itself (known as ''permutations'') that is closed under compositions and inverses, ''G'' is a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on ''X''. If ''X'' consists of ''n'' elements and ''G'' consists of ''all'' permutations, ''G'' is the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub>; in general, any permutation group ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group of ''X''. An early construction due to [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] exhibited any group as a permutation group, acting on itself ({{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''}}) by means of the left [[regular representation]].\n\nIn many cases, the structure of a permutation group can be studied using the properties of its action on the corresponding set. For example, in this way one proves that for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A<sub>''n''</sub> is [[simple group|simple]], i.e. does not admit any proper [[normal subgroup]]s. This fact plays a key role in the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem|impossibility of solving a general algebraic equation of degree {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}} in radicals]].\n\n===Matrix groups===\nThe next important class of groups is given by ''matrix groups'', or [[linear group]]s. Here ''G'' is a set consisting of invertible [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of given order ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' that is closed under the products and inverses. Such a group acts on the ''n''-dimensional vector space ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> by [[linear transformation]]s. This action makes matrix groups conceptually similar to permutation groups, and the geometry of the action may be usefully exploited to establish properties of the group ''G''.\n\n===Transformation groups===\nPermutation groups and matrix groups are special cases of [[transformation group]]s: groups that act on a certain space ''X'' preserving its inherent structure. In the case of permutation groups, ''X'' is a set; for matrix groups, ''X'' is a [[vector space]]. The concept of a transformation group is closely related with the concept of a [[symmetry group]]: transformation groups frequently consist of ''all'' transformations that preserve a certain structure.\n  \nThe theory of transformation groups forms a bridge connecting group theory with [[differential geometry]]. A long line of research, originating with [[Sophus Lie|Lie]] and [[Felix Klein|Klein]], considers group actions on [[manifold]]s by [[homeomorphism]]s or [[diffeomorphism]]s. The groups themselves may be [[discrete group|discrete]] or [[continuous group|continuous]].\n\n===Abstract groups===\nMost groups considered in the first stage of the development of group theory were \"concrete\", having been realized through numbers, permutations, or matrices. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea of an abstract group as a set with operations satisfying a certain system of axioms began to take hold. A typical way of specifying an abstract group is through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by ''generators and relations'',\n\n: <math> G = \\langle S|R\\rangle. </math>\n\nA significant source of abstract groups is given by the construction of a ''factor group'', or [[quotient group]], ''G''/''H'', of a group ''G'' by a [[normal subgroup]] ''H''. [[Class group]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in [[number theory]]. If a group ''G'' is a permutation group on a set ''X'', the factor group ''G''/''H'' is no longer acting on ''X''; but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to worry about this discrepancy.\n\nThe change of perspective from concrete to abstract groups makes it natural to consider properties of groups that are independent of a particular realization, or in modern language, invariant under [[isomorphism]], as well as the classes of group with a given such property: [[finite group]]s, [[periodic group]]s, [[simple group]]s, [[solvable group]]s, and so on. Rather than exploring properties of an individual group, one seeks to establish results that apply to a whole class of groups. The new paradigm was of paramount importance for the development of mathematics: it foreshadowed the creation of [[abstract algebra]] in the works of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Emil Artin]], [[Emmy Noether]], and mathematicians of their school.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Groups with additional structure ===\nAn important elaboration of the concept of a group occurs if ''G'' is endowed with additional structure, notably, of a [[topological space]], [[differentiable manifold]], or [[algebraic variety]]. If the group operations ''m'' (multiplication) and ''i'' (inversion),\n\n: <math> m: G\\times G\\to G, (g,h)\\mapsto gh, \\quad i:G\\to G, g\\mapsto g^{-1}, </math>\n\nare compatible with this structure, that is, they are [[continuous map|continuous]], [[smooth map|smooth]] or [[Regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular]] (in the sense of algebraic geometry) maps, then ''G'' is a [[topological group]], a [[Lie group]], or an [[algebraic group]].<ref>This process of imposing extra structure has been formalized through the notion of a  [[group object]] in a suitable [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Thus Lie groups are group objects in the category of differentiable manifolds and affine algebraic groups are group objects in the category of affine algebraic varieties.</ref>\n\nThe presence of extra structure relates these types of groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for [[abstract harmonic analysis]], whereas [[Lie group]]s (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of [[differential geometry]] and unitary [[representation theory]]. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, [[compact Lie group|compact connected Lie groups]] have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group ''\u0393'' can be realized as a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in a topological group ''G'', the geometry and analysis pertaining to ''G'' yield important results about ''\u0393''. A comparatively recent trend in the theory of finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups ([[profinite group]]s): for example, a single [[powerful p-group|''p''-adic analytic group]] ''G'' has a family of quotients which are finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]] of various orders, and properties of ''G'' translate into the properties of its finite quotients.\n\n==Branches of group theory==\n\n===Finite group theory===\n{{Main|Finite group}}\nDuring the twentieth century, mathematicians investigated some aspects of the theory of finite groups in great depth, especially the [[Local analysis|local theory]] of finite groups and the theory of [[Solvable group|solvable]] and [[nilpotent group]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013|reason=In who's opinion?}} As a consequence, the complete [[classification of finite simple groups]] was achieved, meaning that all those [[simple group]]s from which all finite groups can be built are now known.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians such as [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley]] and [[Robert Steinberg|Steinberg]] also increased our understanding of finite analogs of [[classical groups]], and other related groups. One such family of groups is the family of [[general linear group]]s over [[finite field]]s.  \nFinite groups often occur when considering [[symmetry]] of mathematical or\nphysical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. The theory of [[Lie group]]s,\nwhich may be viewed as dealing with \"[[continuous symmetry]]\", is strongly influenced by the associated [[Weyl group]]s. These are finite groups generated by reflections which act on a finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The properties of finite groups can thus play a role in subjects such as [[theoretical physics]] and [[chemistry]].\n\n===Representation of groups===\n{{Main|Representation theory}}\nSaying that a group ''G'' ''[[Group action (mathematics)|acts]]'' on a set ''X'' means that every element of ''G'' defines a bijective map on the set ''X'' in a way compatible with the group structure. When ''X'' has more structure, it is useful to restrict this notion further: a representation of ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[group homomorphism]]:\n\n:<math>\\rho:G \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V),</math>\n\nwhere [[general linear group|GL]](''V'') consists of the invertible [[linear map|linear transformations]] of ''V''. In other words, to every group element ''g'' is assigned an [[automorphism]] ''\u03c1''(''g'') such that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c1''(''g'') \u2218 ''\u03c1''(''h'') = ''\u03c1''(''gh'')}} for any ''h'' in ''G''.\n\nThis definition can be understood in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics.<ref>Such as [[group cohomology]] or [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]].</ref> On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group ''G'': often, the group operation in ''G'' is abstractly given, but via ''\u03c1'', it corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication|multiplication of matrices]], which is very explicit.<ref>In particular, if the representation is [[faithful representation|faithful]].</ref> On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies the study of the object in question. For example, if ''G'' is finite, it is [[Maschke's theorem|known]] that ''V'' above decomposes into [[irreducible representation|irreducible parts]]. These parts in turn are much more easily manageable than the whole ''V'' (via [[Schur's lemma]]).\n\nGiven a group ''G'', [[representation theory]] then asks what representations of ''G'' exist. There are several settings, and the employed methods and obtained results are rather different in every case: [[representation theory of finite groups]] and representations of [[Lie group]]s are two main subdomains of the theory. The totality of representations is governed by the group's [[character theory|characters]]. For example, [[Fourier series|Fourier polynomial]]s can be interpreted as the characters of [[unitary group|U(1)]], the group of [[complex numbers]] of [[absolute value]] ''1'', acting on the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>2</sup>]]-space of periodic functions.\n\n===Lie theory===\n{{main|Lie theory}}\nA [[Lie group]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are compatible with the [[Differential structure|smooth structure]]. Lie groups are named after [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student [[Arthur Tresse]], page 3.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants diff\u00e9rentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1\u201388 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2273334/files/article.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLie groups represent the best-developed theory of [[continuous symmetry]] of [[mathematical object]]s and [[mathematical structure|structures]], which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics, as well as for modern [[theoretical physics]]. They provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]] ([[differential Galois theory]]), in much the same way as [[permutation groups]] are used in [[Galois theory]] for analysing the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]]. An extension of Galois theory to the case of continuous symmetry groups was one of Lie's principal motivations.\n\n===Combinatorial and geometric group theory===\n{{main|Geometric group theory}}\nGroups can be described in different ways. Finite groups can be described by writing down the [[group table]] consisting of all possible multiplications {{nowrap|''g'' \u2022 ''h''}}. A more compact way of defining a group is by ''generators and relations'', also called the ''presentation'' of a group. Given any set ''F'' of generators <math>\\{g_i\\}_{i\\in I}</math>, the [[free group]] generated by ''F'' surjects onto the group ''G''. The kernel of this map is called the subgroup of relations, generated by some subset ''D''. The presentation is usually denoted by <math>\\langle F \\mid D\\rangle.</math> For example, the group presentation <math>\\langle a,b\\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\rangle</math> describes a group which is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}.</math> A string consisting of generator symbols and their inverses is called a ''word''.\n\n[[Combinatorial group theory]] studies groups from the perspective of generators and relations.<ref>{{harvnb|Schupp|Lyndon|2001}}</ref> It is particularly useful where finiteness assumptions are satisfied, for example finitely generated groups, or finitely presented groups (i.e. in addition the relations are finite). The area makes use of the connection of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s via their [[fundamental group]]s. For example, one can show that every subgroup of a free group is free.\n\nThere are several natural questions arising from giving a group by its presentation. The ''[[word problem for groups|word problem]]'' asks whether two words are effectively the same group element. By relating the problem to [[Turing machine]]s, one can show that there is in general no [[algorithm]] solving this task. Another, generally harder, algorithmically insoluble problem is the [[group isomorphism problem]], which asks whether two groups given by different presentations are actually isomorphic. For example, the group with presentation <math>\\langle x,y \\mid xyxyx = e \\rangle,</math> is isomorphic to the additive group '''Z''' of integers, although this may not be immediately apparent.<ref>Writing <math>z=xy</math>, one has <math>G \\cong \\langle z,y \\mid z^3 = y\\rangle \\cong \\langle z\\rangle.</math></ref>\n\n[[File:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|150px|thumb|The Cayley graph of &lang; x, y \u2223 &rang;, the free group of rank 2.]]\n[[Geometric group theory]] attacks these problems from a geometric viewpoint, either by viewing groups as geometric objects, or by finding suitable geometric objects a group acts on.<ref>{{harvnb|La Harpe|2000}}</ref> The first idea is made precise by means of the [[Cayley graph]], whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the [[word metric]] given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of [[John Milnor|Milnor]] and Svarc then says that given a group ''G'' acting in a reasonable manner on a [[metric space]] ''X'', for example a [[compact manifold]], then ''G'' is [[quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space ''X''.\n\n==Connection of groups and symmetry==\n{{main|Symmetry group}}\nGiven a structured object ''X'' of any sort, a [[symmetry]] is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases, for example\n#If ''X'' is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a [[bijection|bijective]] map from the set to itself, giving rise to [[permutation group]]s.\n#If the object ''X'' is a set of points in the plane with its [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] structure or any other [[metric space]], a symmetry is a [[bijection]] of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an [[isometry]]). The corresponding group is called [[isometry group]] of ''X''.\n#If instead [[angle]]s are preserved, one speaks of [[conformal map]]s. Conformal maps give rise to [[Kleinian group]]s, for example.\n#Symmetries are not restricted to geometrical objects, but include algebraic objects as well.  For instance, the equation <math>x^2-3=0</math> has the two solutions <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> and <math>-\\sqrt{3}</math>. In this case, the group that exchanges the two roots is the [[Galois group]] belonging to the equation.  Every polynomial equation in one variable has a Galois group, that is a certain permutation group on its roots.\n\nThe axioms of a group formalize the essential aspects of [[symmetry]]. Symmetries form a group: they are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] because if you take a symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity comes from the fact that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.\n\n[[Frucht's theorem]] says that every group is the symmetry group of some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. So every abstract group is actually the symmetries of some explicit object.\n\nThe saying of \"preserving the structure\" of an object can be made precise by working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Maps preserving the structure are then the [[morphism]]s, and the symmetry group is the [[automorphism group]] of the object in question.\n\n==Applications of group theory==<!--this section is linked at from [[Applications of group theory]]-->\nApplications of group theory abound. Almost all structures in [[abstract algebra]] are special cases of groups. [[Ring (mathematics)|Rings]], for example, can be viewed as [[abelian group]]s (corresponding to addition) together with a second operation (corresponding to multiplication). Therefore, group theoretic arguments underlie large parts of the theory of those entities.\n\n===Galois theory===\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n[[Galois theory]] uses groups to describe the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial (or more precisely the automorphisms of the algebras generated by these roots). The [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] provides a link between [[algebraic field extension]]s and group theory. It gives an effective criterion for the solvability of polynomial equations in terms of the solvability of the corresponding [[Galois group]]. For example, ''S''<sub>5</sub>, the [[symmetric group]] in 5 elements, is not solvable which implies that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals in the way equations of lower degree can. The theory, being one of the historical roots of group theory, is still fruitfully applied to yield new results in areas such as [[class field theory]].\n\n===Algebraic topology===\n{{main|Algebraic topology}}\n[[Algebraic topology]] is another domain which prominently [[functor|associates]] groups to the objects the theory is interested in. There, groups are used to describe certain invariants of [[topological space]]s. They are called \"invariants\" because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some [[homeomorphism|deformation]]. For example, the [[fundamental group]] \"counts\" how many paths in the space are essentially different. The [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], proved in 2002/2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], is a prominent application of this idea. The influence is not unidirectional, though. For example, algebraic topology makes use of [[Eilenberg\u2013MacLane space]]s which are spaces with prescribed [[homotopy groups]]. Similarly [[algebraic K-theory]] relies in a way on [[classifying space]]s of groups. Finally, the name of the [[torsion subgroup]] of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory.\n\n[[File:Torus.png|thumb|right|200px|A torus. Its abelian group structure is induced from the map {{nowrap|'''C''' \u2192 '''C'''/('''Z''' + ''\u03c4'''''Z''')}}, where ''\u03c4'' is a parameter living in the [[upper half plane]].]]\n\n===Algebraic geometry===\n{{main|Algebraic geometry}}\n[[Algebraic geometry]] likewise uses group theory in many ways. [[Abelian variety|Abelian varieties]] have been introduced above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures.<ref>For example the [[Hodge conjecture]] (in certain cases).</ref> The one-dimensional case, namely [[elliptic curve]]s is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing.<ref>See the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], one of the [[millennium problem]]s</ref> In another direction, [[toric variety|toric varieties]] are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] acted on by a [[torus]]. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in [[algebraic geometry]], in particular [[resolution of singularities]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Abramovich | first1=Dan | last2=Karu | first2=Kalle | last3=Matsuki | first3=Kenji | last4=Wlodarczyk | first4=Jaroslaw | title=Torification and factorization of birational maps | mr=1896232  | year=2002 | journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=531\u2013572 | doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-02-00396-X| arxiv=math/9904135 }}</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n[[Algebraic number theory]] makes uses of groups for some important applications.

The failure of this statement for [[Dedekind ring|more general rings]] gives rise to [[class group]]s and [[regular prime]]s, which feature in [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer's]] treatment of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\n===Harmonic analysis===\n{{main|Harmonic analysis}}\nAnalysis on Lie groups and certain other groups is called [[harmonic analysis]]. [[Haar measure]]s, that is, integrals invariant under the translation in a Lie group, are used for [[pattern recognition]] and other [[image processing]] techniques.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Lenz | first1=Reiner | title=Group theoretical methods in image processing | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn=978-0-387-52290-6 | year=1990 | volume=413 | url=https://archive.org/details/grouptheoretical0000lenz | doi=10.1007/3-540-52290-5 | url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Combinatorics===\nIn [[combinatorics]], the notion of [[permutation]] group and the concept of group action are often used to simplify the counting of a set of objects; see in particular [[Burnside's lemma]].\n\n[[File:Fifths.png|right|thumb|150px|The circle of fifths may be endowed with a cyclic group structure]]\n\n===Music===\nThe presence of the 12-[[Periodic group|periodicity]] in the [[circle of fifths]] yields applications of [[elementary group theory]] in [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]]. [[Transformational theory]] models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group.\n\n===Physics===\nIn [[physics]], groups are important because they describe the symmetries which the laws of physics seem to obey. According to [[Noether's theorem]], every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] of the system. Physicists are very interested in group representations, especially of Lie groups, since these representations often point the way to the \"possible\" physical theories. Examples of the use of groups in physics include the [[Standard Model]], [[gauge theory]], the [[Lorentz group]], and the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n===Chemistry and materials science===\nIn [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]], groups are used to classify [[crystal structure]]s, regular polyhedra, and the [[molecular symmetry|symmetries of molecules]].  The assigned point groups can then be used to determine physical properties (such as [[chemical polarity]] and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]), spectroscopic properties (particularly useful for [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], circular dichroism spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy), and to construct [[molecular orbital]]s.\n\nMolecular symmetry is responsible for many physical and spectroscopic properties of compounds and provides relevant information about how chemical reactions occur. In order to assign a point group for any given molecule, it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it. The symmetry operation is an action, such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane. In other words, it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration. In group theory, the rotation axes and mirror planes are called \"symmetry elements\". These elements can be a point, line or plane with respect to which the symmetry operation is carried out. The symmetry operations of a molecule determine the specific point group for this molecule.\n\n[[File:Miri2.jpg|thumb|100px|Water molecule with symmetry axis]]\nIn [[chemistry]], there are five important symmetry operations. They are identity operation ('''E)''', rotation operation or proper rotation('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') , reflection operation('''\u03c3)''', inversion('''i''') and rotation reflection operation or improper rotation ('''S<sub>''n''</sub>'''). The identity operation ('''E''') consists of leaving the molecule as it is. This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a [[chiral]] molecule consists of only the identity operation. An identity operation is a characteristic of every molecule even if it has no symmetry. Rotation around an axis ('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. It is rotation through the 360\u00b0/n about a rotation axis. For example, if a [[water]] molecule rotates 180\u00b0 around the axis that passes through the [[oxygen]] atom and between the [[hydrogen]] atoms, it is in the same configuration as it started. In this case, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, since applying it twice produces the identity operation.In the reflection operation ('''\u03c3''') the molecule contains a mirror plane. Many molecules have mirror planes, although they may not be obvious to identify. The reflection operation exchanges left and right, as if each point had moved perpendicularly through the plane to a position exactly as far from the plane as when it started.When the plane is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation, it is called '''\u03c3<sub>''h''</sub>'''\u00a0 (horizontal). Other planes, which contain the principal axis of rotation, are labeled '''\u03c3<sub>''v''</sub>''' (vertical) or '''\u03c3<sub>''d''</sub>''' (dihedral).  Other symmetry operations are inversion and improper rotation (rotation followed by reflection).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shriver |first1=Duward | last2=Atkins | first2=Peter |date=2009 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5th |publisher=Freeman, W.H. & Company |isbn=9781429218207 }}</ref>\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\nGroup theory can be used to resolve the incompleteness of the statistical interpretations of mechanics developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]], relating to the summing of an infinite number of probabilities to yield a meaningful solution.<ref>[[Norbert Wiener]], Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine,  {{ISBN|978-0262730099}}, Ch 2</ref>\n\n===Cryptography===\n \nVery large groups of prime order constructed in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] serve for [[public-key cryptography]]. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from the flexibility of the geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the [[discrete logarithm]] very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, [[Caesar cipher|Caesar's cipher]], may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. Most cryptographic schemes use groups in some way. In particular Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange uses finite cyclic groups. So the term group-based cryptography refers mostly to cryptographic protocols that use infinite nonabelian groups such as a braid group.\n\n[[File:Caesar3.svg|thumb|left|150px|The [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''<sub>26</sub> underlies [[Caesar's cipher]].]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of group theory}}\nGroup theory has three main historical sources: [[number theory]], the theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, and [[geometry]]. The number-theoretic strand was begun by [[Leonhard Euler]], and developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss's]] work on [[modular arithmetic]] and additive and multiplicative groups related to [[quadratic field]]s. Early results about [[permutation group]]s were obtained by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]], and [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] in their quest for general solutions of polynomial equations of high degree. [[\u00c9variste Galois]] coined the term \"group\" and established a connection, now known as [[Galois theory]], between the nascent theory of groups and [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]]. In geometry, groups first became important in [[projective geometry]] and, later, [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed group theory to be the organizing principle of geometry.\n\n[[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]], in the 1830s, was the first to employ groups to determine the solvability of [[polynomial equation]]s. [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] pushed these investigations further by creating the theory of [[permutation groups]]. The second historical source for groups stems from [[geometry|geometrical]] situations. In an attempt to come to grips with possible geometries (such as [[euclidean geometry|euclidean]], [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] or [[projective geometry]]) using group theory, [[Felix Klein]] initiated the [[Erlangen programme]]. [[Sophus Lie]], in 1884, started using groups (now called [[Lie group]]s) attached to [[analysis (mathematics)|analytic]] problems. Thirdly, groups were, at first implicitly and later explicitly, used in [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nThe different scope of these early sources resulted in different notions of groups. The theory of groups was unified starting around 1880. Since then, the impact of group theory has been ever growing, giving rise to the birth of [[abstract algebra]] in the early 20th century, [[representation theory]], and many more influential spin-off domains. The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is a vast body of work from the mid 20th century, classifying all the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of group theory topics]]\n*[[Examples of groups]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Linear algebraic groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-97370-8 | mr=1102012  | year=1991 | volume=126 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0941-6}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Carter | first1=Nathan C. | title=Visual group theory | url=http://web.bentley.edu/empl/c/ncarter/vgt/ | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | series=Classroom Resource Materials Series | isbn=978-0-88385-757-1 | mr=2504193  | year=2009}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cannon | first1=John J. | title=Computers in group theory: A survey | mr=0290613  | year=1969 | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=12 | pages=3\u201312 | doi=10.1145/362835.362837}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Herstellung von Graphen mit vorgegebener abstrakter Gruppe | url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | year=1939 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=6 | pages=239\u201350 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083831/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | archivedate=2008-12-01 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Golubitsky | first1=Martin| last2=Stewart | first2=Ian | author1-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician)| title =Nonlinear dynamics of networks: the groupoid formalism |mr=2223010  |journal= Bull.

Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. [[Linear algebraic group]]s and [[Lie group]]s are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.\n\nVarious physical systems, such as [[crystal]]s and the [[hydrogen atom]], may be modelled by [[symmetry group]]s. Thus group theory and the closely related [[representation theory]] have many important applications in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[materials science]]. Group theory is also central to [[public key cryptography]].\n\nOne of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century<ref>* Elwes, Richard, \"[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups],\" ''Plus Magazine'', Issue 41, December 2006.</ref> was the collaborative effort, taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980, that culminated in a complete [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\n==Main classes of groups==\n{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}\n\nThe range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from [[Finite set|finite]] [[permutation group]]s and special examples of [[matrix group]]s to abstract groups that may be specified through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by [[Generating set of a group|generators]] and [[Binary relation|relations]].\n\n===Permutation groups===\nThe first [[Class (set theory)|class]] of groups to undergo a systematic study was [[permutation group]]s. Given any set ''X'' and a collection ''G'' of [[bijection]]s of ''X'' into itself (known as ''permutations'') that is closed under compositions and inverses, ''G'' is a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on ''X''. If ''X'' consists of ''n'' elements and ''G'' consists of ''all'' permutations, ''G'' is the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub>; in general, any permutation group ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group of ''X''. An early construction due to [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] exhibited any group as a permutation group, acting on itself ({{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''}}) by means of the left [[regular representation]].\n\nIn many cases, the structure of a permutation group can be studied using the properties of its action on the corresponding set. For example, in this way one proves that for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A<sub>''n''</sub> is [[simple group|simple]], i.e. does not admit any proper [[normal subgroup]]s. This fact plays a key role in the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem|impossibility of solving a general algebraic equation of degree {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}} in radicals]].\n\n===Matrix groups===\nThe next important class of groups is given by ''matrix groups'', or [[linear group]]s. Here ''G'' is a set consisting of invertible [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of given order ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' that is closed under the products and inverses. Such a group acts on the ''n''-dimensional vector space ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> by [[linear transformation]]s. This action makes matrix groups conceptually similar to permutation groups, and the geometry of the action may be usefully exploited to establish properties of the group ''G''.\n\n===Transformation groups===\nPermutation groups and matrix groups are special cases of [[transformation group]]s: groups that act on a certain space ''X'' preserving its inherent structure. In the case of permutation groups, ''X'' is a set; for matrix groups, ''X'' is a [[vector space]]. The concept of a transformation group is closely related with the concept of a [[symmetry group]]: transformation groups frequently consist of ''all'' transformations that preserve a certain structure.\n  \nThe theory of transformation groups forms a bridge connecting group theory with [[differential geometry]]. A long line of research, originating with [[Sophus Lie|Lie]] and [[Felix Klein|Klein]], considers group actions on [[manifold]]s by [[homeomorphism]]s or [[diffeomorphism]]s. The groups themselves may be [[discrete group|discrete]] or [[continuous group|continuous]].\n\n===Abstract groups===\nMost groups considered in the first stage of the development of group theory were \"concrete\", having been realized through numbers, permutations, or matrices. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea of an abstract group as a set with operations satisfying a certain system of axioms began to take hold. A typical way of specifying an abstract group is through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by ''generators and relations'',\n\n: <math> G = \\langle S|R\\rangle. </math>\n\nA significant source of abstract groups is given by the construction of a ''factor group'', or [[quotient group]], ''G''/''H'', of a group ''G'' by a [[normal subgroup]] ''H''. [[Class group]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in [[number theory]]. If a group ''G'' is a permutation group on a set ''X'', the factor group ''G''/''H'' is no longer acting on ''X''; but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to worry about this discrepancy.\n\nThe change of perspective from concrete to abstract groups makes it natural to consider properties of groups that are independent of a particular realization, or in modern language, invariant under [[isomorphism]], as well as the classes of group with a given such property: [[finite group]]s, [[periodic group]]s, [[simple group]]s, [[solvable group]]s, and so on. Rather than exploring properties of an individual group, one seeks to establish results that apply to a whole class of groups. The new paradigm was of paramount importance for the development of mathematics: it foreshadowed the creation of [[abstract algebra]] in the works of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Emil Artin]], [[Emmy Noether]], and mathematicians of their school.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Groups with additional structure ===\nAn important elaboration of the concept of a group occurs if ''G'' is endowed with additional structure, notably, of a [[topological space]], [[differentiable manifold]], or [[algebraic variety]]. If the group operations ''m'' (multiplication) and ''i'' (inversion),\n\n: <math> m: G\\times G\\to G, (g,h)\\mapsto gh, \\quad i:G\\to G, g\\mapsto g^{-1}, </math>\n\nare compatible with this structure, that is, they are [[continuous map|continuous]], [[smooth map|smooth]] or [[Regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular]] (in the sense of algebraic geometry) maps, then ''G'' is a [[topological group]], a [[Lie group]], or an [[algebraic group]].<ref>This process of imposing extra structure has been formalized through the notion of a  [[group object]] in a suitable [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Thus Lie groups are group objects in the category of differentiable manifolds and affine algebraic groups are group objects in the category of affine algebraic varieties.</ref>\n\nThe presence of extra structure relates these types of groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for [[abstract harmonic analysis]], whereas [[Lie group]]s (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of [[differential geometry]] and unitary [[representation theory]]. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, [[compact Lie group|compact connected Lie groups]] have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group ''\u0393'' can be realized as a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in a topological group ''G'', the geometry and analysis pertaining to ''G'' yield important results about ''\u0393''. A comparatively recent trend in the theory of finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups ([[profinite group]]s): for example, a single [[powerful p-group|''p''-adic analytic group]] ''G'' has a family of quotients which are finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]] of various orders, and properties of ''G'' translate into the properties of its finite quotients.\n\n==Branches of group theory==\n\n===Finite group theory===\n{{Main|Finite group}}\nDuring the twentieth century, mathematicians investigated some aspects of the theory of finite groups in great depth, especially the [[Local analysis|local theory]] of finite groups and the theory of [[Solvable group|solvable]] and [[nilpotent group]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013|reason=In who's opinion?}} As a consequence, the complete [[classification of finite simple groups]] was achieved, meaning that all those [[simple group]]s from which all finite groups can be built are now known.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians such as [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley]] and [[Robert Steinberg|Steinberg]] also increased our understanding of finite analogs of [[classical groups]], and other related groups. One such family of groups is the family of [[general linear group]]s over [[finite field]]s.  \nFinite groups often occur when considering [[symmetry]] of mathematical or\nphysical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. The theory of [[Lie group]]s,\nwhich may be viewed as dealing with \"[[continuous symmetry]]\", is strongly influenced by the associated [[Weyl group]]s. These are finite groups generated by reflections which act on a finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The properties of finite groups can thus play a role in subjects such as [[theoretical physics]] and [[chemistry]].\n\n===Representation of groups===\n{{Main|Representation theory}}\nSaying that a group ''G'' ''[[Group action (mathematics)|acts]]'' on a set ''X'' means that every element of ''G'' defines a bijective map on the set ''X'' in a way compatible with the group structure. When ''X'' has more structure, it is useful to restrict this notion further: a representation of ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[group homomorphism]]:\n\n:<math>\\rho:G \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V),</math>\n\nwhere [[general linear group|GL]](''V'') consists of the invertible [[linear map|linear transformations]] of ''V''. In other words, to every group element ''g'' is assigned an [[automorphism]] ''\u03c1''(''g'') such that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c1''(''g'') \u2218 ''\u03c1''(''h'') = ''\u03c1''(''gh'')}} for any ''h'' in ''G''.\n\nThis definition can be understood in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics.<ref>Such as [[group cohomology]] or [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]].</ref> On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group ''G'': often, the group operation in ''G'' is abstractly given, but via ''\u03c1'', it corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication|multiplication of matrices]], which is very explicit.<ref>In particular, if the representation is [[faithful representation|faithful]].</ref> On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies the study of the object in question. For example, if ''G'' is finite, it is [[Maschke's theorem|known]] that ''V'' above decomposes into [[irreducible representation|irreducible parts]]. These parts in turn are much more easily manageable than the whole ''V'' (via [[Schur's lemma]]).\n\nGiven a group ''G'', [[representation theory]] then asks what representations of ''G'' exist. There are several settings, and the employed methods and obtained results are rather different in every case: [[representation theory of finite groups]] and representations of [[Lie group]]s are two main subdomains of the theory. The totality of representations is governed by the group's [[character theory|characters]]. For example, [[Fourier series|Fourier polynomial]]s can be interpreted as the characters of [[unitary group|U(1)]], the group of [[complex numbers]] of [[absolute value]] ''1'', acting on the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>2</sup>]]-space of periodic functions.\n\n===Lie theory===\n{{main|Lie theory}}\nA [[Lie group]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are compatible with the [[Differential structure|smooth structure]]. Lie groups are named after [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student [[Arthur Tresse]], page 3.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants diff\u00e9rentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1\u201388 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2273334/files/article.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLie groups represent the best-developed theory of [[continuous symmetry]] of [[mathematical object]]s and [[mathematical structure|structures]], which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics, as well as for modern [[theoretical physics]]. They provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]] ([[differential Galois theory]]), in much the same way as [[permutation groups]] are used in [[Galois theory]] for analysing the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]]. An extension of Galois theory to the case of continuous symmetry groups was one of Lie's principal motivations.\n\n===Combinatorial and geometric group theory===\n{{main|Geometric group theory}}\nGroups can be described in different ways. Finite groups can be described by writing down the [[group table]] consisting of all possible multiplications {{nowrap|''g'' \u2022 ''h''}}. A more compact way of defining a group is by ''generators and relations'', also called the ''presentation'' of a group. Given any set ''F'' of generators <math>\\{g_i\\}_{i\\in I}</math>, the [[free group]] generated by ''F'' surjects onto the group ''G''. The kernel of this map is called the subgroup of relations, generated by some subset ''D''. The presentation is usually denoted by <math>\\langle F \\mid D\\rangle.</math> For example, the group presentation <math>\\langle a,b\\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\rangle</math> describes a group which is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}.</math> A string consisting of generator symbols and their inverses is called a ''word''.\n\n[[Combinatorial group theory]] studies groups from the perspective of generators and relations.<ref>{{harvnb|Schupp|Lyndon|2001}}</ref> It is particularly useful where finiteness assumptions are satisfied, for example finitely generated groups, or finitely presented groups (i.e. in addition the relations are finite). The area makes use of the connection of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s via their [[fundamental group]]s. For example, one can show that every subgroup of a free group is free.\n\nThere are several natural questions arising from giving a group by its presentation. The ''[[word problem for groups|word problem]]'' asks whether two words are effectively the same group element. By relating the problem to [[Turing machine]]s, one can show that there is in general no [[algorithm]] solving this task. Another, generally harder, algorithmically insoluble problem is the [[group isomorphism problem]], which asks whether two groups given by different presentations are actually isomorphic. For example, the group with presentation <math>\\langle x,y \\mid xyxyx = e \\rangle,</math> is isomorphic to the additive group '''Z''' of integers, although this may not be immediately apparent.<ref>Writing <math>z=xy</math>, one has <math>G \\cong \\langle z,y \\mid z^3 = y\\rangle \\cong \\langle z\\rangle.</math></ref>\n\n[[File:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|150px|thumb|The Cayley graph of &lang; x, y \u2223 &rang;, the free group of rank 2.]]\n[[Geometric group theory]] attacks these problems from a geometric viewpoint, either by viewing groups as geometric objects, or by finding suitable geometric objects a group acts on.<ref>{{harvnb|La Harpe|2000}}</ref> The first idea is made precise by means of the [[Cayley graph]], whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the [[word metric]] given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of [[John Milnor|Milnor]] and Svarc then says that given a group ''G'' acting in a reasonable manner on a [[metric space]] ''X'', for example a [[compact manifold]], then ''G'' is [[quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space ''X''.\n\n==Connection of groups and symmetry==\n{{main|Symmetry group}}\nGiven a structured object ''X'' of any sort, a [[symmetry]] is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases, for example\n#If ''X'' is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a [[bijection|bijective]] map from the set to itself, giving rise to [[permutation group]]s.\n#If the object ''X'' is a set of points in the plane with its [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] structure or any other [[metric space]], a symmetry is a [[bijection]] of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an [[isometry]]). The corresponding group is called [[isometry group]] of ''X''.\n#If instead [[angle]]s are preserved, one speaks of [[conformal map]]s. Conformal maps give rise to [[Kleinian group]]s, for example.\n#Symmetries are not restricted to geometrical objects, but include algebraic objects as well.  For instance, the equation <math>x^2-3=0</math> has the two solutions <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> and <math>-\\sqrt{3}</math>. In this case, the group that exchanges the two roots is the [[Galois group]] belonging to the equation.  Every polynomial equation in one variable has a Galois group, that is a certain permutation group on its roots.\n\nThe axioms of a group formalize the essential aspects of [[symmetry]]. Symmetries form a group: they are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] because if you take a symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity comes from the fact that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.\n\n[[Frucht's theorem]] says that every group is the symmetry group of some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. So every abstract group is actually the symmetries of some explicit object.\n\nThe saying of \"preserving the structure\" of an object can be made precise by working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Maps preserving the structure are then the [[morphism]]s, and the symmetry group is the [[automorphism group]] of the object in question.\n\n==Applications of group theory==<!--this section is linked at from [[Applications of group theory]]-->\nApplications of group theory abound. Almost all structures in [[abstract algebra]] are special cases of groups. [[Ring (mathematics)|Rings]], for example, can be viewed as [[abelian group]]s (corresponding to addition) together with a second operation (corresponding to multiplication). Therefore, group theoretic arguments underlie large parts of the theory of those entities.\n\n===Galois theory===\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n[[Galois theory]] uses groups to describe the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial (or more precisely the automorphisms of the algebras generated by these roots). The [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] provides a link between [[algebraic field extension]]s and group theory. It gives an effective criterion for the solvability of polynomial equations in terms of the solvability of the corresponding [[Galois group]]. For example, ''S''<sub>5</sub>, the [[symmetric group]] in 5 elements, is not solvable which implies that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals in the way equations of lower degree can. The theory, being one of the historical roots of group theory, is still fruitfully applied to yield new results in areas such as [[class field theory]].\n\n===Algebraic topology===\n{{main|Algebraic topology}}\n[[Algebraic topology]] is another domain which prominently [[functor|associates]] groups to the objects the theory is interested in. There, groups are used to describe certain invariants of [[topological space]]s. They are called \"invariants\" because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some [[homeomorphism|deformation]]. For example, the [[fundamental group]] \"counts\" how many paths in the space are essentially different. The [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], proved in 2002/2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], is a prominent application of this idea. The influence is not unidirectional, though. For example, algebraic topology makes use of [[Eilenberg\u2013MacLane space]]s which are spaces with prescribed [[homotopy groups]]. Similarly [[algebraic K-theory]] relies in a way on [[classifying space]]s of groups. Finally, the name of the [[torsion subgroup]] of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory.\n\n[[File:Torus.png|thumb|right|200px|A torus. Its abelian group structure is induced from the map {{nowrap|'''C''' \u2192 '''C'''/('''Z''' + ''\u03c4'''''Z''')}}, where ''\u03c4'' is a parameter living in the [[upper half plane]].]]\n\n===Algebraic geometry===\n{{main|Algebraic geometry}}\n[[Algebraic geometry]] likewise uses group theory in many ways. [[Abelian variety|Abelian varieties]] have been introduced above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures.<ref>For example the [[Hodge conjecture]] (in certain cases).</ref> The one-dimensional case, namely [[elliptic curve]]s is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing.<ref>See the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], one of the [[millennium problem]]s</ref> In another direction, [[toric variety|toric varieties]] are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] acted on by a [[torus]]. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in [[algebraic geometry]], in particular [[resolution of singularities]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Abramovich | first1=Dan | last2=Karu | first2=Kalle | last3=Matsuki | first3=Kenji | last4=Wlodarczyk | first4=Jaroslaw | title=Torification and factorization of birational maps | mr=1896232  | year=2002 | journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=531\u2013572 | doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-02-00396-X| arxiv=math/9904135 }}</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n[[Algebraic number theory]] makes uses of groups for some important applications.

The failure of this statement for [[Dedekind ring|more general rings]] gives rise to [[class group]]s and [[regular prime]]s, which feature in [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer's]] treatment of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\n===Harmonic analysis===\n{{main|Harmonic analysis}}\nAnalysis on Lie groups and certain other groups is called [[harmonic analysis]]. [[Haar measure]]s, that is, integrals invariant under the translation in a Lie group, are used for [[pattern recognition]] and other [[image processing]] techniques.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Lenz | first1=Reiner | title=Group theoretical methods in image processing | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn=978-0-387-52290-6 | year=1990 | volume=413 | url=https://archive.org/details/grouptheoretical0000lenz | doi=10.1007/3-540-52290-5 | url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Combinatorics===\nIn [[combinatorics]], the notion of [[permutation]] group and the concept of group action are often used to simplify the counting of a set of objects; see in particular [[Burnside's lemma]].\n\n[[File:Fifths.png|right|thumb|150px|The circle of fifths may be endowed with a cyclic group structure]]\n\n===Music===\nThe presence of the 12-[[Periodic group|periodicity]] in the [[circle of fifths]] yields applications of [[elementary group theory]] in [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]]. [[Transformational theory]] models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group.\n\n===Physics===\nIn [[physics]], groups are important because they describe the symmetries which the laws of physics seem to obey. According to [[Noether's theorem]], every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] of the system. Physicists are very interested in group representations, especially of Lie groups, since these representations often point the way to the \"possible\" physical theories. Examples of the use of groups in physics include the [[Standard Model]], [[gauge theory]], the [[Lorentz group]], and the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n===Chemistry and materials science===\nIn [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]], groups are used to classify [[crystal structure]]s, regular polyhedra, and the [[molecular symmetry|symmetries of molecules]].  The assigned point groups can then be used to determine physical properties (such as [[chemical polarity]] and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]), spectroscopic properties (particularly useful for [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], circular dichroism spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy), and to construct [[molecular orbital]]s.\n\nMolecular symmetry is responsible for many physical and spectroscopic properties of compounds and provides relevant information about how chemical reactions occur. In order to assign a point group for any given molecule, it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it. The symmetry operation is an action, such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane. In other words, it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration. In group theory, the rotation axes and mirror planes are called \"symmetry elements\". These elements can be a point, line or plane with respect to which the symmetry operation is carried out. The symmetry operations of a molecule determine the specific point group for this molecule.\n\n[[File:Miri2.jpg|thumb|100px|Water molecule with symmetry axis]]\nIn [[chemistry]], there are five important symmetry operations. They are identity operation ('''E)''', rotation operation or proper rotation('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') , reflection operation('''\u03c3)''', inversion('''i''') and rotation reflection operation or improper rotation ('''S<sub>''n''</sub>'''). The identity operation ('''E''') consists of leaving the molecule as it is. This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a [[chiral]] molecule consists of only the identity operation. An identity operation is a characteristic of every molecule even if it has no symmetry. Rotation around an axis ('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. It is rotation through the 360 degree/n about a rotation axis. For example, if a [[water]] molecule rotates 180\u00b0 around the axis that passes through the [[oxygen]] atom and between the [[hydrogen]] atoms, it is in the same configuration as it started. In this case, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, since applying it twice produces the identity operation.In the reflection operation ('''\u03c3''') the molecule contains a mirror plane. Many molecules have mirror planes, although they may not be obvious to identify. The reflection operation exchanges left and right, as if each point had moved perpendicularly through the plane to a position exactly as far from the plane as when it started.When the plane is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation, it is called '''\u03c3<sub>''h''</sub>'''\u00a0 (horizontal). Other planes, which contain the principal axis of rotation, are labeled '''\u03c3<sub>''v''</sub>''' (vertical) or '''\u03c3<sub>''d''</sub>''' (dihedral).  Other symmetry operations are inversion and improper rotation (rotation followed by reflection).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shriver |first1=Duward | last2=Atkins | first2=Peter |date=2009 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5th |publisher=Freeman, W.H. & Company |isbn=9781429218207 }}</ref>\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\nGroup theory can be used to resolve the incompleteness of the statistical interpretations of mechanics developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]], relating to the summing of an infinite number of probabilities to yield a meaningful solution.<ref>[[Norbert Wiener]], Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine,  {{ISBN|978-0262730099}}, Ch 2</ref>\n\n===Cryptography===\n \nVery large groups of prime order constructed in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] serve for [[public-key cryptography]]. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from the flexibility of the geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the [[discrete logarithm]] very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, [[Caesar cipher|Caesar's cipher]], may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. Most cryptographic schemes use groups in some way. In particular Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange uses finite cyclic groups. So the term group-based cryptography refers mostly to cryptographic protocols that use infinite nonabelian groups such as a braid group.\n\n[[File:Caesar3.svg|thumb|left|150px|The [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''<sub>26</sub> underlies [[Caesar's cipher]].]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of group theory}}\nGroup theory has three main historical sources: [[number theory]], the theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, and [[geometry]]. The number-theoretic strand was begun by [[Leonhard Euler]], and developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss's]] work on [[modular arithmetic]] and additive and multiplicative groups related to [[quadratic field]]s. Early results about [[permutation group]]s were obtained by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]], and [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] in their quest for general solutions of polynomial equations of high degree. [[\u00c9variste Galois]] coined the term \"group\" and established a connection, now known as [[Galois theory]], between the nascent theory of groups and [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]]. In geometry, groups first became important in [[projective geometry]] and, later, [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed group theory to be the organizing principle of geometry.\n\n[[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]], in the 1830s, was the first to employ groups to determine the solvability of [[polynomial equation]]s. [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] pushed these investigations further by creating the theory of [[permutation groups]]. The second historical source for groups stems from [[geometry|geometrical]] situations. In an attempt to come to grips with possible geometries (such as [[euclidean geometry|euclidean]], [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] or [[projective geometry]]) using group theory, [[Felix Klein]] initiated the [[Erlangen programme]]. [[Sophus Lie]], in 1884, started using groups (now called [[Lie group]]s) attached to [[analysis (mathematics)|analytic]] problems. Thirdly, groups were, at first implicitly and later explicitly, used in [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nThe different scope of these early sources resulted in different notions of groups. The theory of groups was unified starting around 1880. Since then, the impact of group theory has been ever growing, giving rise to the birth of [[abstract algebra]] in the early 20th century, [[representation theory]], and many more influential spin-off domains. The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is a vast body of work from the mid 20th century, classifying all the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of group theory topics]]\n*[[Examples of groups]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Linear algebraic groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-97370-8 | mr=1102012  | year=1991 | volume=126 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0941-6}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Carter | first1=Nathan C. | title=Visual group theory | url=http://web.bentley.edu/empl/c/ncarter/vgt/ | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | series=Classroom Resource Materials Series | isbn=978-0-88385-757-1 | mr=2504193  | year=2009}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cannon | first1=John J. | title=Computers in group theory: A survey | mr=0290613  | year=1969 | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=12 | pages=3\u201312 | doi=10.1145/362835.362837}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Herstellung von Graphen mit vorgegebener abstrakter Gruppe | url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | year=1939 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=6 | pages=239\u201350 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083831/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | archivedate=2008-12-01 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Golubitsky | first1=Martin| last2=Stewart | first2=Ian | author1-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician)| title =Nonlinear dynamics of networks: the groupoid formalism |mr=2223010  |journal= Bull.

However, when France occupied Damascus the picture changed dramatically. Britain did not want to see France extend its control southward to the borders of Palestine and closer to the Suez Canal.... It suddenly became important to know 'what is the \"Syria\" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and 'does it include Transjordania?'... The British foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, decided that it did not and that Britain henceforth would regard the area as independent, but in 'closest relation' with Palestine.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|pp=46\u201348}} Samuel then organised a meeting of Transjordanian leaders at Salt on 21 August, at which he would announce British plans...

The meeting, held in the courtyard of the Catholic church, was attended by about 600 people..... Sentence by sentence his speech describing British policy was translated into Arabic: political officers would be stationed in towns to help organise local governments; Transjordan would not come under Palestinian administration; there would be no conscription and no disarmament......On balance, Samuel's statement of policy was unobjectionable. Three things feared by the Arabs of Transjordan \u2013 conscription, disarmament, and annexation by Palestine \u2013 were abjured.... The presence of a few British agents, unsupported by troops, seemed a small concession in return for the protection Britain's presence would afford against the French, who, it was feared, might press their occupation southward...

Karsh writes that at the same time Curzon wrote to [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Vansittart]], stating: \"His Majesty's Government are already treating 'Trans-Jordania' as separate from the Damascus State, while at the same time avoiding any definite connection between it and Palestine, thus leaving the way open for the establishment there, should it become advisable, of some form of independent Arab government, perhaps by arrangement with King Hussein or other Arab chiefs concerned.\"}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|p=44}} Since the end of the war the territory north of Ma'an had been ruled by Damascus as a province of Faysal's Kingdom of Syria. Although it fell within the British zone according to the Sykes-Picot agreement, Britain was content with the arrangement because it favoured Arab rule in the interior and Faysal was, after all, British protege. However, when France occupied Damascus the picture changed dramatically. Britain did not want to see France extend its control southward to the borders of Palestine and closer to the Suez Canal.... It suddenly became important to know 'what is the \"Syria\" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and 'does it include Transjordania?'... The British foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, decided that it did not and that Britain henceforth would regard the area as independent, but in 'closest relation' with Palestine.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|pp=46\u201348}} Samuel then organised a meeting of Transjordanian leaders at Salt on 21 August, at which he would announce British plans... On 20 August Samuel and a few political officers left Jerusalem by car, headed for the Jordan river, the frontier of British territory at that time. \u2018It is an entirely irregular proceeding,\u2019 he noted, \u2018my going outside my own jurisdiction into a country which was Faisal's, and is still being administered by the Damascus Government, now under French influence. But it is equally irregular for a government under French influence to be exercising functions in territory which is agreed to be within the British sphere: and of the two irregularities I prefer mine.\u2019... The meeting, held in the courtyard of the Catholic church, was attended by about 600 people..... Sentence by sentence his speech describing British policy was translated into Arabic: political officers would be stationed in towns to help organise local governments; Transjordan would not come under Palestinian administration; there would be no conscription and no disarmament......On balance, Samuel's statement of policy was unobjectionable. Three things feared by the Arabs of Transjordan \u2013 conscription, disarmament, and annexation by Palestine \u2013 were abjured.... The presence of a few British agents, unsupported by troops, seemed a small concession in return for the protection Britain's presence would afford against the French, who, it was feared, might press their occupation southward... Samuel returned to Jerusalem well pleased with the success of his mission. He left behind several officers to see to the administration of Transjordan and the maintenance of British influence.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wasserstein|2003|pp=105\u2013106}} \"Palestine, therefore, was not partitioned in 1921\u20131922.

While [[Electronic body music|EBM]] (electronic body music) has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial tends to have a grittier, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Front Line Assembly]], and other groups, either from [[Canada]] or the [[Benelux]]. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the ''dark electro'' genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the ''aggrotech'' offshoot.<ref name=\"machens\">Interview with Axel Machens, Vendetta Music, April 23, 2007.

In contrast to the straight EBM style, electro-industrial groups use harsher beats and raspy, distorted, or digitized vocals. In contrast to [[industrial rock]], electro-industrial groups mostly avoided guitars, other than Skinny Puppy, who used E-Guitar Elements since the mid 80s in songs like ''[[Testure]]'' or ''[[Dig It (Skinny Puppy song)|Dig It]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=ma0000012207|pure_url=yes}}|title=Electro-Industrial|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nElectro-industrial was anticipated by 1980s groups such as [[SPK (band)|SPK]],<ref name=machens/><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000581133|pure_url=yes}}|title=Machine Age Voodoo - SPK|author=John Bush|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref> [[Die Form]], [[Borghesia]], [[Klinik]], [[Skinny Puppy]],<ref>Adem Tepedelen, \"Skinny Puppy Bark Back\", ''Rolling Stone'', May 20, 2004.

The war began with the repeated attacks by [[Khmer Rouge|Khmer Rouge Army]] on the southwestern border of Vietnam, with the defining moment of [[Ba Chuc massacre]], resulting in the deaths of over 3000 Vietnamese civilians.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/7-facts-didnt-know-cambodian-vietnamese-war.html|website=War History Online|title=A Terrible Conflict \u2013 The Cambodian-Vietnamese War|date=4 November 2016|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref> On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War#Invasion of Kampuchea|full-scale invasion]] of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|government]] of the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] from power.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Vietnamese and Cambodian communists had formed an alliance to fight U.S.-backed regimes in their respective countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the [[Khmer Rouge]] leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to preempt an attempt by the Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began [[Purge|purging]] Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the [[Lon Nol]] regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of [[Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c]].{{Citation needed|reason=Need source for the attack on Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c, google only directs here |date=June 2019}}\n\nIn spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. Therefore, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978 the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved; the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to negotiate seriously.\n\nSmall-scale fighting continued between the two countries throughout 1978, as [[China]] tried to mediate peace talks between the two sides. However, neither country would agree to an acceptable compromise. By the end of 1978, Vietnamese leaders decided to remove the Khmer Rouge-dominated regime of Democratic Kampuchea, perceiving it as being pro-Chinese and hostile towards Vietnam. On 25 December 1978, 150,000 Vietnamese troops invaded Democratic Kampuchea and overran the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] in just two weeks, thereby ending the excesses of Pol Pot's regime, which had been responsible for the deaths of almost a quarter of all Cambodians between 1975 and December 1978. Vietnamese military intervention and the occupying forces' subsequent allowing in of international food aid to mitigate the massive famine is viewed as ending the [[Cambodian genocide]].<ref>''New York Times'', August 8, 1979.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,912511,00.html|title=CAMBODIA: Help for the Auschwitz of Asia|date=November 5, 1979|work=[[Time Magazine]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913105748/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,912511,00.html|archive-date=September 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 January 1979 the pro-Vietnamese [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK) was established in [[Phnom Penh]], marking the beginning of a ten-year Vietnamese occupation. During that period, the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea continued to be recognised by the [[United Nations]] as the legitimate government of Kampuchea, as several armed resistance groups were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. Behind the scenes, Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] of the PRK regime approached factions of the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] (CGDK) to begin peace talks. Under diplomatic and economic pressure from the international community, the Vietnamese government implemented a series of economic and foreign policy reforms, which led to their withdrawal from Kampuchea in September 1989.\n\nAt the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, under the Australian-sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan, representatives of the CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing arrangement by forming a unity government known as the Supreme National Council (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage, while the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided not to participate in the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's [[FUNCINPEC]] movement defeated the [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP), formerly the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]] (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat, and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such an outcome, [[Norodom Ranariddh]], the leader of FUNCINPEC, agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the [[Monarchy of Cambodia|constitutional monarchy]] was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian government.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese history ===\n[[Angkor]], the seat of the [[Khmer Empire]], was subjected to Vietnamese influence as early as the 13th century. Vietnamese influence spread gradually and indirectly, and it was not until the early-19th century that Vietnam exercised direct control.<ref>Thus-Huong, p. 6</ref> However, Vietnamese attempts to annex Cambodia began in 17th century when Vietnamese forces helped Cambodian dissidents topple its only Muslim King, [[Ramathipadi I]]. From then on, Vietnam frequently intervened in Cambodia. In 1813, [[Ang Chan II|Nak Ong Chan]] gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a [[protectorate]]. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese \"province\".<ref>Morris, p. 25</ref> Throughout the 1830s, Vietnam attempted to erase [[Khmer culture]], which had derived the basis of Cambodian society, dress, and religion from India rather than China.<ref>SarDesai, p. 7</ref> The trend of Vietnamese dominance continued during French colonisation, under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its southern region (which would later be [[Saigon]], the [[Mekong Delta]] and [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province|T\u00e2y Ninh]]) to the Vietnamese.<ref>Morris, p. 32</ref> The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia had lost during the previous centuries.<ref>Young, p. 305</ref>\n\n=== Rise of communism ===\nThe communist movement in Cambodia and Vietnam began before [[World War II]] with the founding of the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP), almost exclusively dominated by the Vietnamese, originally meant to fight French colonial rule in [[Indochina]].<ref>Morris, p.&nbsp;159</ref> In 1941, Nguyen Ai Quoc (commonly known by his alias [[Ho Chi Minh]]) founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, or the [[Viet Minh]]. When the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II, he initiated the [[First Indochina War|first Indochinese war of independence]] against the French. During this time, Vietnamese forces made extensive use of Cambodian territory to transport weapons, supplies, and troops. This relationship lasted throughout the [[Vietnam War]], when Vietnamese communists used Cambodia as a transport route and staging area for attacks on South Vietnam. In 1951, Vietnam guided the establishment of a separate Cambodian communist party, the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]] (KPRP), which allied with a nationalist separatist Cambodian movement, the [[Khmer Serei]] (Free Khmers), in order to pursue independence. In accordance with the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] negotiating the end of the French domination, newly created communist North Vietnam pulled all of its Viet Minh soldiers and cadres out of Cambodia; however, since the KPRP was staffed primarily by ethnic Vietnamese or Cambodians under its tutelage, approximately 5,000 communist cadres went with them.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 93\">Morris, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe power vacuum the Vietnamese communists left in their wake in Cambodia was soon filled by the return of a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries, many of whom received their communist education in France.<ref>Jackson, p. 246</ref> In 1960, the KPRP changed its name to the [[Kampuchean Communist Party]] (KCP), and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar ([[Pol Pot]]), [[Ieng Sary]], and [[Khieu Samphan]] as the true political institution memorialising the KCP <!--what does this mean, memorialising the KCP???-->. This clique became the genesis of the Khmer Rouge, and its doctrine was heavily influenced by [[Maoist]] ideology.<ref>Jackson, p. 250</ref>\n\n=== Lon Nol's anti-Vietnamese sentiment ===\n{{Main|FULRO}}\nAfter the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|removal of Sihanouk from power]] in March 1970, the leader of the new [[Khmer Republic]], [[Lon Nol]], despite being anti-communist and ostensibly in the \"pro-American\" camp, backed the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races|FULRO]] against all Vietnamese, both anti-communist South Vietnam and the communist [[Viet Cong]]. Lon Nol planned a slaughter of all Vietnamese people in Cambodia and a restoration of South Vietnam to a revived [[Champa]] state. Many were slaughtered and dumped in the [[Mekong River]] at the hands of Lon Nol's anti-communist forces.<ref name=\"Kiernan2008\">{{cite book|author=Ben Kiernan|title=Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com./books?id=R5p7cRyK748C&pg=PA548#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne Univ.

In its place, they hoped to create a classless society based entirely on worker-peasants. The radical ideologies and goals of the Khmer Rouge were alien concepts to the masses.<ref name=\"Young 312\">Young, p. 312</ref> The socialist revolution held very little popular appeal, which led Pol Pot and his cadres to use ultra-nationalist sentiment, repressive and murderous rule, and propaganda aimed at demonising the Vietnamese to maintain control.<ref>Jackson, p. 244</ref>\n\nEven before the Vietnam War ended, the relationship between the Khmer Rouge\u2014which was in the process of seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol\u2014and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the \"friendship\" between the Khmer Rouge and China.<ref>Van der Kroef, p. 29</ref>\n\n== Diplomacy and military action ==\n=== 1975\u20131976: from fighting to building friendly relations ===\n[[File:PolPot.jpg|thumb|[[Pol Pot]] was the leader of the Khmer Rouge. Following the Khmer Rouge victory on 17 April 1975, he became Premier of Democratic Kampuchea and led the country in its war against Vietnam.]]\n\nThe [[Fall of Phnom Penh]] and the [[Fall of Saigon]] in April 1975 immediately brought a new conflict between Vietnam and Cambodia. Although the North Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge had previously fought side by side, the leaders of the newly created [[Democratic Kampuchea]] continued to view Vietnam with great suspicion, because they believed the Vietnamese communists had never given up their dream of creating an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the leader.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\">Farrell, p. 195</ref> For that reason, the Kampuchean government removed all North Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchean territory shortly after their capture of [[Phnom Penh]] on 17 April 1975. In the first major clash between the two former allies, the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] (KRA) invaded the Vietnamese island of [[Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c]] on 1 May 1975 (barely 24 hours after Saigon fell), claiming it was part of Kampuchea's territory.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" />\n\nNine days later, on 10 May 1975, the KRA continued its incursion by capturing the [[Th\u1ed5 Chu Islands]], where it executed 500 Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnamese military immediately responded to Kampuchean actions by launching a counterattack and removing Kampuchean forces from Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c and Th\u1ed5 Chu, and then invading the Kampuchean island of [[Koh Poulo Wai]].<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" /> In June 1975, while on a visit to [[Hanoi]], Pol Pot proposed that Vietnam and his country should sign a treaty of friendship and begin discussions on border disputes. However, those discussions never materialised, and the Kampucheans claimed that Vietnam turned down both offers.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" /> In August 1975, Vietnam returned the island of Koh Poulo Wai to Kampuchea and formally recognised Kampuchean sovereignty over the island.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" />\n\nFollowing those incidents, both countries attempted to improve their diplomatic relations with a series of congratulatory messages and exchange visits. On 17 April 1976, Vietnamese leaders sent a message to congratulate Khieu Samphan, [[Nuon Chea]] and Pol Pot on their \"elections\" as President, President of the People's Representatives and Premier of Kampuchea, respectively.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 93\" /> Furthermore, the Vietnamese even denounced the alleged \"U.S. bombing\" of [[Siem Reap]] in February 1976, thereby reinforcing the Kampucheans' fictitious claims over the incident.<ref>Morris, pp.&nbsp;93\u201394.</ref> In response, in June 1976, the Kampuchean leadership sent a message to the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]], which had governed South Vietnam since the fall of Saigon, congratulating them on the seventh anniversary of their establishment.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 94\">Morris, p. 94</ref>\n\nIn July 1976, following the establishment of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] as a reunified country, Phnom Penh Radio broadcast a commentary which proclaimed the \"militant solidarity and friendship between peoples of Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam grow constantly greener and sturdier\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 94\" /> However, during that same month, Pol Pot publicly hinted at tensions between Vietnam and Kampuchea when he told a visiting Vietnamese media delegation that there were \"obstacles and difficulties\" in the relationship between the two countries.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 95\">Morris, p.&nbsp;95.</ref> Nonetheless, on 21 September 1976, the first air service connecting Hanoi and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] with Phnom Penh was established. Then in December 1976, the Kampuchean Revolutionary Organisation sent greetings to the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]] during their [[4th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Fourth Congress]].<ref name=\"Morris, p. 94\" />\n\n=== 1977: build-up to war ===\nTowards the end of 1976, while Vietnam and Kampuchea publicly appeared to be improving their relationships, the private suspicions of both countries' leadership grew. From the Vietnamese perspective, they were the patrons of genuine [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] revolutions in Southeast Asia, so it was vital for them to exercise control over the Kampucheans and the Laotians.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 97\">Morris, p. 97</ref> Indeed, that was the reason North Vietnam supported the Khmer Rouge during their fight against the Lon Nol regime, in the hope that the Kampuchean communists would adopt a pro-Vietnamese line upon their victory in the same way as the [[Pathet Lao]] had done. However, their hopes were dashed as early as 1973, because [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) formations operating in Khmer Rouge-occupied territories were occasionally subjected to armed attacks by their allies. The Vietnamese position inside Kampuchea was further weakened after the end of the war, as there were no pro-Vietnamese elements left within the Kampuchean Communist Party.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 96\">Morris, p. 96</ref>\n\nWhen the pro-Chinese Pol Pot and his brother-in-law Ieng Sary resigned from their respective positions as premier and foreign minister in September 1976, Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] and General Secretary of the Communist Party [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]] were optimistic that Vietnam could exercise greater influence on the Kampucheans. In a private meeting with the Soviet ambassador to Vietnam on 16 November 1976, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n dismissed both Ieng Sary and Pol Pot as \"bad people\" for their pro-Chinese policies.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 96\" /> Le Duan then asserted that Nuon Chea, who had ascended to the position of Premier of Democratic Kampuchea as Pol Pot's replacement, was a person of pro-Vietnamese orientation, so Vietnam could exercise its influence through him. However, the events which developed over the next few months would prove L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n had been mistaken in his assessment of Nuon Chea.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 96\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the Kampuchean leadership had developed a fear and hatred of the Vietnamese leadership as a result of Vietnam's historical dominance over their country. From the Kampuchean perspective, the Vietnamese strategy to dominate Indochina involved infiltrating the communist parties of Kampuchea and Laos with Vietnamese-trained cadres.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 97\" /> For that reason, when the first group of North Vietnamese-trained Khmer Rouge personnel returned to the country, they were immediately purged from the KCP. During the months following the defeat of the Lon Nol regime, Pol Pot continued to purge the KCP and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea of those who he believed to be Soviet and Vietnamese agents. Then, in the context of the triumphalism that prevailed among the Khmer Rouge leadership\u2014they claimed they had single-handedly defeated the \"American imperialists\"\u2014Democratic Kampuchea began preparing for war against Vietnam.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 98\">Morris, p. 98</ref>\n\nAs the KRA made preparations for its war against Vietnam, state-controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory messages to the Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on the second anniversary of its establishment, on 17 April 1977. On 30 April 1977, the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the Kampuchean reply came in the form of a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of [[An Giang Province|An Giang]] and [[Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c]], killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 98\" /> The PAVN responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a [[demilitarised zone]] between the opposing forces.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 36</ref>\n\nBoth sides ignored each other's proposals, and the KRA continued sending soldiers across the border to attack Vietnamese towns and villages. In September 1977, KRA artillery struck several Vietnamese villages along the border, and six villages in [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province]] were overrun by Kampuchean infantry. Shortly afterwards, six divisions of the KRA advanced about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} into [[Tay Ninh Province]], where they killed more than 1,000 Vietnamese civilians.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\">O'Dowd, p. 37</ref> Angered by the scale of Kampuchean assaults, the PAVN assembled eight divisions, estimated at around 60,000 soldiers, to launch a retaliatory strike against Kampuchea. On 16 December 1977, the PAVN divisions, with support from elements of the [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], crossed the border along several axes with the objective of forcing the Kampuchean Government to negotiate.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" />\n\nOn the battlefield, the KRA quickly lost ground to the Vietnamese. By the end of December 1977, Vietnam had won a clear military victory over Kampuchea, as Vietnamese formations marched through [[Svay Rieng Province]] and only stopped short of entering the provincial capital. Despite the ferocity of the Vietnamese retaliation, the Kampuchean Government remained defiant.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /> On 31 December 1977, Khieu Sampham declared that the Kampuchean Government would \"temporarily\" sever diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the Vietnamese military withdrew from the \"sacred territory of Democratic Kampuchea\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 102\">Morris, p. 102</ref> On 6 January 1978, PAVN divisions were only {{convert|38|km|abbr=on}} from Phnom Penh, but the Vietnamese Government decided to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea because they had failed to achieve Vietnam's political objective. During the withdrawal, the PAVN also evacuated thousands of prisoners and civilian refugees, including future leader [[Hun Sen]].<ref name=\"Morris, p. 102\" />\n\n=== 1978: preparations for regime change ===\n[[File:FUNSK-emblem.JPG|thumb|Emblem of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]]\nInstead of being sobered by the Vietnamese show of force, the Kampuchean government boasted that the Vietnamese withdrawal was a major victory for Democratic Kampuchea, comparing it to the \"defeat of U.S. imperialism\" on 17 April 1975. The Kampucheans went on further to proclaim that \"our 6 January victory over the annexationist, Vietnamese aggressor enemy has given all of us greater confidence in the forces of our people and nation, in our Kampuchean Communist Party and our Kampuchean Revolutionary Army, and in our Party's line of people's war\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 103\" /> The Kampuchean leadership claimed that one Kampuchean soldier was equal to 30 Vietnamese soldiers, so if Kampuchea could raise two million soldiers from a population of eight million, it could wipe out Vietnam's population of 50 million and still have six million people left.<ref>Morris, p. 104</ref> In reality, Kampuchean leaders simply ignored the condition of the population in their own country and Vietnam; the Vietnamese, though poor, were in good physical condition, while Kampuchea's population was physically and mentally exhausted from years of hard labour, starvation and disease.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 103\" />\n\nIn addition to the disparity in population, there was also a great disparity between the fighting capabilities of the armed forces of the two countries. In 1977, Vietnam was estimated to have 615,000 soldiers and 900 tanks, supported by a 12,000-member air force with 300 combat aircraft, including one squadron of light bombers. In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles and limited air capability.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 103\" /> Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam's border regions. In January 1978, KRA forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in [[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]] Province.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /> On 27 January 1978, Vietnam started calling on the KRA along the border regions to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" />\n\nAgainst the backdrop of military clashes, between 9 January and 20 February 1978, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Phan Hien made several trips to [[Beijing]] to hold discussions with representatives of the Kampuchean government, which ultimately proved to be fruitless. On 18 January 1978, China attempted to mediate between Kampuchea and Vietnam when Vice Premier [[Deng Yingchao]] travelled to Phnom Penh, where she was met with strong resistance by Kampuchean leaders.<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 124\">Khoo, p. 124</ref> Meanwhile, Vietnamese government officials began conducting secret meetings with [[So Phim]], the Khmer Rouge leader in Kampuchea's Eastern Military Zone, to plan a military uprising backed by Vietnam. During that same period, military setbacks experienced by the KRA in the Eastern Military Zone prompted Pol Pot to label the region as a \"nest of traitors\".<ref>Morris, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:H\u00e0i c\u1ed1t.jpg|thumb|left|Skulls of victims of the [[Ba Ch\u00fac Massacre]]]]\nIn order to purge the Eastern Military Zone of those he perceived to have been contaminated by the Vietnamese, Pol Pot ordered military units from the Southwest Zone to move into eastern Kampuchea and eliminate the \"hidden traitors\". Unable to withstand an attack from the Kampuchea Government, So Phim committed suicide while his deputy [[Heng Samrin]] defected to Vietnam.<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 124\" /> On 12 April 1978, the Kampuchean government declared they and Vietnam could negotiate again if the Vietnamese gave up their expansionist ambitions and recognised Kampuchea's sovereignty.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /> However, there was also a pre-condition requiring Vietnam to meet several obligations through a seven-month trial ceasefire. The Vietnamese government immediately rejected the demand. In response, two KRA divisions penetrated up to {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} into Vietnamese territory and [[Ba Ch\u00fac massacre|massacred]] over 3,000 Vietnamese civilians in the village of [[Ba Ch\u00fac]] in An Giang Province.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" />\n\nIn June 1978, the VPAF started bombing KRA positions along the border regions, flying about 30 bombing sorties per day and inflicting heavy casualties on the Kampucheans. By that stage in the conflict, most surviving leaders of the Eastern Military Zone had escaped into Vietnam, where they assembled at various secret camps with the purpose of forming a Vietnamese-backed \"liberation army\" to fight against the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 107\">Morris, p. 107</ref> Meanwhile, the Vietnamese Communist Party Politburo was meeting in Hanoi to discuss its strategy for Kampuchea. It concluded that the Khmer Rouge regime was a proxy of China, which had been trying to fill the power vacuum following the withdrawal of the United States. As such, China was identified as Vietnam's main enemy, and its client regime in Phnom Penh had to be removed by conventional military force, because the Vietnamese adaptation of the Maoist \"[[people's war]]\" doctrine had not been a success against the Khmer Rouge's security apparatus.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /><ref name=\"Morris, p. 107\" />\n\nTo reflect the attitude of the country's leaders, Vietnam's state-controlled media stepped up its propaganda war against the Khmer Rouge, with the official ''[[Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n]]'' newspaper regularly calling for international intervention to save the Kampuchean people from domestic terror initiated by the Khmer Rouge regime. Furthermore, instead of sending congratulatory messages as they had done in the previous years, the Vietnamese media changed their tone and began referring to the Kampuchean Government as the \"Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique\" as the Kampuchean military continued their campaign in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 107\" /> By the end of June, the Vietnamese military assembled a multi-division task force to launch another limited-objective campaign against the Kampucheans. Again, the Vietnamese pushed the KRA forces back into the provincial cities of [[Suong]] and [[Prey Veng (city)|Prey Veng]] and then pulled out. However, as they had done before, the KRA moved its artillery back towards the border and continued shelling Vietnamese villages as though nothing had happened.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\">O'Dowd, p. 38</ref>\n\nDuring the second half of 1978, Vietnamese leaders devoted much of their energy towards the military campaign against the Khmer Rouge regime, by seeking political support from the Soviet Union. In a briefing with Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials on 25 July 1978, the Soviet [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Hanoi was told that the Kampuchean Government had deployed 14 of its 17 regular army divisions and 16 local regiments along the border with Vietnam.<ref>Morris, p. 108</ref> Then, in early September 1978, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n informed the Soviet ambassador that Vietnam aimed to \"solve fully this question of Kampuchea by the beginning of 1979\". While Vietnam was laying the political foundation for the military campaign against Kampuchea, Soviet ships were reported to be unloading military hardware and ammunition in [[Cam Ranh Bay]].<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> In October 1978, Vietnamese radio broadcast what they claimed were accounts of uprisings against the Khmer Rouge regime, urging members of the KRA either to overthrow the \"Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique\" or defect to Vietnam.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 110\">Morris, p. 110</ref>\n\nIn a major turning point in the course of Soviet-Vietnamese and Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relations, and ultimately the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed between Vietnam and the Soviet Union on 3 November 1978, which guaranteed the former of vital Soviet military aid in the scenario that China intervened in the conflict.<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 127\" /> Later, in November 1978, a command and control headquarters was established for the planned invasion of Kampuchea, with Senior General [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Anh]] taking full control of PAVN units along the border areas. The Vietnamese government drafted 350,000 men into the military to replace earlier losses and augment its units along the border. While the new recruits were completing training, ten divisions were deployed to the border regions of [[Long An Province|Long An]], \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and T\u00e2y Ninh Provinces. Vietnam also shifted three divisions based in Laos south towards the Laos-Kampuchea border.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> On 13 December 1978, the Chinese Government warned Vietnam that its patience was limited, and that Vietnam would be punished if it behaved in an \"unbridled fashion\".<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 127\" />\n\nNonetheless, the final piece of the Vietnamese strategy emerged when Vietnam announced the formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS) in the \"liberation zones\" of Kampuchea.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> Hanoi claimed that KUFNS was an independent Kampuchean communist movement, with members drawn from all walks of life. Heng Samrin, formerly a member of the Khmer Rouge and commander of the KRA 4th Division, was the chairman of the KUFNS Central Committee.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 110\" /> Previously, the KUFNS was known as the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Kampuchea (PRGK), which consisted of 300 former Khmer Rouge cadres who defected to Vietnam. The PRGK regularly sent representatives abroad in search of support, before Vietnam abandoned the \"people's war\" concept in favour of a conventional military campaign.<ref>IBP USA, p. 69</ref>\n\nNot to be outdone by the Vietnamese military build-up, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was busy strengthening its armed forces with Chinese support. In previous years, China had only provided the KRA with a limited quantities of arms and ammunition, but as relations with Vietnam worsened in 1978, Beijing established additional supply routes through Kampuchea and increased the volume of military hardware which travelled down each route.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> On the eve of the Vietnamese invasion, Kampuchea had an estimated 73,000 soldiers in the Eastern Military Zone bordering Vietnam.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> At that time, all branches of the Kampuchean armed forces were significantly strengthened by large quantities of Chinese-made military equipment, which included fighter aircraft, patrol boats, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, trucks and tanks. Additionally, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese advisers in both military and civilian capacities, providing their support to the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" />\n\n== {{Anchor|Invasion of Kampuchea}}Invasion of Kampuchea ==\nOn 21 December 1978, Kampuchea's new-found strength was tested when a Vietnamese offensive, consisting of two divisions, crossed the border and moved towards the town of [[Krati\u00e9 (town)|Kratie]], while other support divisions were deployed along local routes to cut off the logistical tail of Kampuchean units.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 111\">Morris, p. 111</ref> Despite enjoying generous support from China, the KRA could not withstand the Vietnamese offensive and suffered heavy casualties.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 40</ref> Finally, on 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion using 13 divisions, estimated at 150,000 soldiers well-supported by heavy artillery and air power.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia3-3.htm \"1978\u20131979 \u2013 Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528154408/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia3-3.htm |date=2017-05-28 }}, ''Globalsecurity.com''</ref> Initially, Kampuchea directly challenged Vietnam's military might through conventional fighting methods, but this tactic resulted in the loss of half of the KRA within two weeks. Heavy defeats on the battlefield prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 111\" /> On 7 January 1979, the PAVN entered Phnom Penh along with members of the KUFNS. On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese Kampuchean state, known as the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as the Chief of State and [[Pen Sovan]] as General Secretary of the newly refounded [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]].<ref name=\"Morris, p. 111\" />\n\nThe Khmer Rouge leadership, with much of its political and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in [[Thailand]], where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in [[Trat Province]].<ref>Martin, p. 216</ref> Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country's economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered by the lack of educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime's attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating in the western regions of the country.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 99\">Swann, p. 99</ref>\n\n=== International response ===\nShortly after the capture of Phnom Penh, representatives of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] called for an emergency meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]], so Prince Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\">Swann, p. 98</ref> Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea's sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" /> Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by China, [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. However, the resolution was not approved due to opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.\n\nBetween 16\u201319 February 1979 Vietnam and the new Kampuchean regime held a summit meeting which concluded with the two countries signing a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 97\">Swann, p. 97</ref> Article 2 of the treaty stated that the security of Vietnam and Kampuchea were interrelated; thus they would help defend each other \"against schemes and acts of sabotage by the imperialist and international reactionary forces\", thereby legitimising the presence of Vietnamese troops on Kampuchean soil.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" /> Soon afterwards, the Soviet Union, the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and India recognised the Vietnamese-installed People's Republic of Kampuchea. The Soviet government praised the PRK's \"remarkable victory\" and expressed its full support for the regime's advance towards socialism. Furthermore, the Soviets harshly criticised the Khmer Rouge regime's record of terror, which they implied had been imposed by China.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" />\n\nAt the 34th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council that it was the sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 97\" /> In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China.<ref>White, p. 123</ref> By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam's use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" />\n\nThailand, which shared an 800-kilometer (500 mile) border with Kampuchea and has historically feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Singapore]] showed their support for Thailand's position.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" /> Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam's invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable threat to the region's security and stability.<ref>Jones & Smith, p. 53</ref> That view was shared by China, which went as far as accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" />\n\nIn addition, [[North Korea]], whose leader [[Kim Il-sung]] had offered Sihanouk sanctuary after he was ousted by Lon Nol in 1970, also refused to recognize the People's Republic of Kampuchea.<ref name=DPRK-CGDK>Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency.

The following day, China announced that it would not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting unexpectedly harsh resistance by well-trained Vietnamese forces equipped with Soviet and captured American weapons. Furthermore, Vietnam's politburo had ordered a general mobilization and begun planning for full conscription. The Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces.<ref>Mei p. 78</ref> Although China failed either to decisively win the 27-day conflict or to force a withdrawal of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription.<ref>Slocomb, p. 260</ref> China's stationing of a large force on the border and engaging in border skirmishes [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts, 1979\u20131991|during subsequent conflicts]] also required Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border throughout the 1980s.\n\n== KPNLF insurgency ==\n[[File:Cambodia anti-PRK border camps.png|thumb|Border camps hostile to the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|PRK]]; 1979\u20131984. KPNLF camps shown in black.]]\n\nWhen the Khmer Rouge regime was removed from power in January 1979, the Kampuchean people hoped that peace and liberty would return to their country. This was reinforced by the Constitution of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, proclaimed in 1981, which specifically stated that Kampuchea was an independent, peaceful state where power belonged to the people.<ref>Peaslee, p. 452</ref> However, there was a deep contrast between what was written in the constitution and reality, because the Kampuchean people began to despair at what they viewed as the Vietnamese occupation of their country, rather than a liberation that had freed them from the brutality of Democratic Kampuchea. That perception was reinforced by the presence of Vietnamese advisers who worked at every level of Heng Samrin's Kampuchean Government. In 1986, for example, there was one Vietnamese adviser for every Kampuchean cabinet minister and one adviser for each one of their three deputy ministers. Furthermore, it was reported that final decisions made by a Kampuchean minister had to receive final approval from the Vietnamese adviser, who usually dictated policies.<ref>Martin, p. 217</ref> Opposition to the Vietnamese was further fomented by human rights abuses committed by the Vietnamese and their allies. To fulfill its [[K5 Plan]], a construction project to strengthen the Cambodia-Thai border, the PRK government conscripted 380,000 people, with large numbers succumbing to malaria.<ref>Etcheson 2005, pp. 24, 27</ref> [[Claude Malhuret]] of [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] reported that a tactic the Vietnamese and KPRAF used to fight the Khmer Rouge was to withhold food from areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge. Thousands of tons of food provided by international relief organizations spoiled on the docks of [[Kompong Som]]. Food sent by aid organisations was often instead used to feed Vietnamese troops and Cambodians living under Vietnamese control.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128201614/http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf |archivedate=28 January 2017|url=http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf|title=The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan: The Consequences for Afghanistan and the Soviet Union|publisher=Medecins sans Fronti\u00e8res |page=427 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo resist the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea and the regime which they installed, the Khmer Rouge called on the Kampuchean people to unite and fight the Vietnamese. However, due to the brutality which they had experienced under the deposed regime, many Kampucheans believed that any political movement aimed at restoring national freedom must oppose both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 107\">Swann, p. 107</ref> In response to such preconditions, two non-communist movements were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. The first group, a right-wing and pro-Western organisation, was formed in October 1979 by former Prime Minister [[Son Sann]] and was called the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] (KPNLF). The KPNLF operated from several [[refugee camp]]s on the Thai-Cambodian border, where it controlled thousands of civilians.<ref>Corfield, p. 9.</ref> At its peak, the armed branch of the KPNLF were estimated to have between 12,000 and 15,000 fighters, but a third of that number were lost through fighting and desertions during the [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand#1985|Vietnamese dry season offensive]] of 1984\u20131985. Nonetheless, the KPNLF continued to operate in small groups, harassing the Vietnamese and their Kampuchean allies using guerrilla tactics.<ref>Swann, p. 108</ref>\n\nThe other non-communist organisation was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, formed by Sihanouk and known by its French acronym [[FUNCINPEC]].<ref>Swann, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the Khmer Rouge following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer Rouge representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea's seat at the UN vacant on the basis that neither the Khmer Rouge nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 106\">Swann, p. 106</ref> He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition of the Khmer Rouge, and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.<ref>Swann, pp. 106\u2013108</ref>\n\nIn the early days of the Vietnamese occupation, Kampuchean resistance groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure from the international community to reform itself. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\">Swann, p. 103</ref> The idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" />\n\nIn August 1981, unity talks between the three organizations appeared to have collapsed as a result of conflicting interests. Sihanouk, who feared the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge, proposed that all resistance groups disarm themselves following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. Meanwhile, Son Sann demanded that the KPNLF be the lead organization within the proposed alliance, and the leaders of the Khmer Rouge \"most compromised\" by the atrocities in Kampuchea be exiled to China.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" /> Against these preconditions, Khieu Samphan reminded his rivals that the autonomy of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea should not be undermined.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 104\">Swann, p. 104</ref> On 22 November 1982, Singapore, with the backing of ASEAN, proposed that three organizations form a coalition government with equal decision-making powers within the alliance. Singapore's proposal was welcomed by Sihanouk, who believed it was a fair deal for the non-communist movements.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 104\" /> Khieu Samphan, on the other hand, rejected that idea, viewing it as an attempt by Sihanouk and Son Sann to isolate the Khmer Rouge. However, Sihanouk knew that Chinese support would not be made available to the FUNCINPEC unless he made some compromises and joined the Khmer Rouge on their terms.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" /> So, in February 1982, Sihanouk met with Khieu Samphan in Beijing to work out their differences. In what he described as \"another concession\", Khieu Samphan proposed forming a coalition government without integrating the other resistance groups into institutions associated with Democratic Kampuchea. However, he emphasized that all parties must defend the legal status of Democratic Kampuchea as the legitimate state representing Kampuchea on the world stage.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 104\" /> In May 1982, with the urging of Sihanouk, Son Sann decided to form a coalition government with the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" />\n\nOn 22 June 1982, leaders of the three organizations formalised the formation of their coalition government by signing a Thai-sponsored agreement which established the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] (CGDK). Accordingly, the CGDK's Inner Cabinet consisted of Sihanouk as the President of Democratic Kampuchea, Khieu Samphan as the Vice-President in charge of foreign affairs and Son Sann as Prime Minister. Below the Inner Cabinet were six separate committees responsible for national defence, economy and finance, social affairs and public health, military affairs and the media.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 105\">Swann, p. 105</ref> During a meeting between [[Kim Il-sung]] and Sihanouk on 10 April 1986, in [[Pyongyang]], Kim Il-Sung reassured Sihanouk that North Korea would continue to regard him as the legitimate [[head of state]] of Kampuchea.<ref name=DPRK-CGDK /> By 1987, Democratic Kampuchea still held its membership at the UN General Assembly, even though it lacked four criteria of statehood: people, territory, government, and supreme authority within the borders of a country.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 106\" /> In spite of those limitations, forces of the three armed factions within the CGDK continued to fight the Vietnamese to achieve their objective of \"bring[ing] about the implementation of the International Conference on Cambodia and other relevant UN General Assembly resolutions\".<ref name=\"Swann, p. 105\" />\n\n== Vietnamese reform and withdrawal ==\n[[File:Cambodia-mountainsW5.JPG|thumb|Mountains along the Cambodian-Thai Border north of the road between [[Serei Saophoan]] and [[Aranyaprathet]]. These were one of the areas where Khmer Rouge fighters hid at the time of the [[K5 Plan]].]]\n\nWhen the Vietnamese leaders launched their invasion of Kampuchea to remove the Khmer Rouge regime in 1978, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that they had severely miscalculated international sympathies toward their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese use of force against Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\">Thayer, p. 10</ref> Thus, Kampuchea became more than just a military problem for Vietnam, quickly evolving into an economic and diplomatic problem in the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed on the periphery of the international community.<ref name=\"Broyle, p. 115\">Broyle, p. 115</ref>\n\nThe international community's political stance towards Kampuchea had a severe impact on the Vietnamese economy, which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts. The United States, which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam, convinced other countries of the United Nations to deprive Vietnam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea of much-needed funds by denying them membership to major international organisations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>Morley & Nishihara, p. 204</ref> In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending all economic aid to Vietnam, and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea, the Sino-Soviet rivalry and the problem of the [[boat people]].<ref>Shiraishi, p. 103</ref> [[Sweden]], which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West, also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as virtually every other country cancelled its aid.<ref name=\"Broyle, p. 115\" />\n\nIn addition to external pressure, domestic policies implemented by the Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven to be largely ineffective in stimulating the country's economic growth. By building on the Soviet model of [[centrally planned economy|central economic planning]], Vietnam placed most emphasis on the development of heavy industries, while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 2\">Largo, p. 2</ref> Furthermore, attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos, as economic output was driven down by dislocation of the general population. In addition to those failed economic policies, Vietnam maintained the fifth-largest armed forces in the world, with 1.26&nbsp;million regular soldiers under arms, 180,000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984.<ref>Thayer, p. 2</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kelemen|first=Paul|title=Soviet Strategy in Southeast Asia: The Vietnam Factor|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|volume=24|issue=3|page=341|date=March 1984|issn=0004-4687|jstor=2644070 |doi=10.1525/as.1984.24.3.01p0146p}}</ref> Consequently, the Vietnamese Government had to spend one-third of its budget on the military and the campaign in Kampuchea, despite receiving US$1.2&nbsp;billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union, thus further hampering Vietnam's economic rebuilding efforts.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 2\" />\n\n[[File:Cambodia\u2013Vietnam Friendship Monument.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cambodia\u2013Vietnam Friendship Monument]]\n\nIn response to international pressure, and to avoid engaging in a debilitating conflict with various local armed resistance groups, Vietnam began withdrawing its military forces from Kampuchea as early as 1982. But the withdrawal process lacked international verification, so foreign observers simply dismissed Vietnam's movement of troops as mere rotations.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 18\" /> In 1984, in order to disengage from Kampuchea, Vietnam unveiled a five-phase strategy known as the [[K5 Plan]]. The plan was authored by General Le Duc Anh, who had led the Vietnamese campaign in Kampuchea. The first phase required the Vietnamese military to capture the bases of armed groups in western Kampuchea and along the border with Thailand. The following phases included sealing off the border with Thailand, destroying local resistance groups, providing security for the population, and building up the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\" /> Foreign observers believed that the Vietnamese Army completed the first phase of the K5 Plan during the dry season offensive of 1984\u201385, when the base camps of several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups were overrun. Afterwards, the majority of ten Vietnamese divisions were assigned to operations on the frontiers, with the remainder staying in major provinces to protect the local population and to train the Kampuchean armed forces.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\" />\n\nBy 1985, international isolation and economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely more and more on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided US$1.4&nbsp;billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at US$1.7&nbsp;billion in the period between 1981 and 1985.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 197\">Largo, p. 197</ref> Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981\u20131985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of US$5.4&nbsp;billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached US$1.8&nbsp;billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90% of Vietnam's demand for raw materials and 70% of its grain imports.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 197\" /> Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 197\" /> In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20% of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.<ref>Faure & Schwab, p. 58</ref>\n\n[[File:Phnom Penh 1989.jpg|thumb|left|10 years of the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea officially ended on 26 September 1989, when the last remaining contingent of Vietnamese troops were pulled out. The departing Vietnamese soldiers received much publicity and fanfare as they moved through [[Phnom Penh]], the capital of [[Kampuchea]].]]\n\nTo reengage with the international community, and to deal with the economic challenges brought by the changes in the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Europe]], Vietnamese leaders decided to embark on a series of reforms. At the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th National Party Congress]] in December 1986, newly appointed General Secretary of the VCP [[Nguyen Van Linh]] introduced a major reform known as [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]], the Vietnamese term for \"renovation\", in order to fix Vietnam's economic problems.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 199\">McCargo, p. 199</ref> However, Vietnamese leaders concluded that Vietnam's dire economic situation came as a result of the international isolation which followed its invasion of Kampuchea in 1978, and that for \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi to be successful it needed radical changes in defence and foreign policy.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 197\">McCargo, p. 197</ref> Subsequently, in June 1987, the Vietnamese Politburo adopted a new defence strategy in Resolution No. 2, calling for the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers from international duties, a reduction in the size of the army through a discharge of 600,000 soldiers and the establishment of a set ratio for military expenditures.<ref>Thayer, p. 15</ref>\n\nThen, on 13 May 1988, the Vietnamese Politburo adopted Resolution No. 13 on foreign policy, which aimed to achieve diversification and multilateralisation of Vietnam's foreign relations. Its main objectives were to end the embargoes imposed by UN members, integrate Vietnam with the regional and international community, and ultimately attract foreign investment and development aid.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 197\" /> As part of this change, Vietnam ceased to regard the United States as a long-term foe and China as an imminent and dangerous enemy. In addition, official Vietnamese propaganda stopped labeling ASEAN as a \"[[NATO]]-type\" organisation.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 199\" /> To implement the new reforms, Vietnam, with support from the Soviet Union, started transferring several years' worth of military equipment to the KPRAF, which numbered more than 70,000 soldiers. The Vietnamese Ministry of Defense's International Relations Department then advised its Kampuchean counterparts to only use the available equipment to maintain their current level of operations, and not to engage in major operations which could exhaust those supplies.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 18\">Thayer, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Vietnam was estimated to have about 100,000 troops in Kampuchea, but, sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach, the Vietnamese Government began withdrawing forces in earnest. Between April and July 1989, 24,000 Vietnamese soldiers returned home. Then, between 21 and 26 September 1989, after suffering 15,000 soldiers killed and another 30,000 wounded during the 10-year occupation,<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\" /> Vietnam's commitment to Kampuchea was officially over, when the remaining 26,000 Vietnamese soldiers were pulled out.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 18\" /> However, armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese-installed PRK regime claimed that Vietnamese troops were still operating on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989. For example, non-communist groups engaging in land-grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite Vietnamese Special Forces near Tamar Puok along Route 69.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 19\">Thayer, p. 19</ref> Then, in March 1991, Vietnamese units were reported to have re-entered [[Kampot Province]] to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 19\" /> Despite such claims, on 23 October 1991, the Vietnamese Government signed the [[1991 Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Agreement]], which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 19\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Paris Peace Agreement ===\n{{Main|1991 Paris Peace Accords}}\n[[File:Vietnam Cambodia Friendshiip Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Cambodia\u2013Vietnam Friendship Monument]] was constructed to commemorate the ousting of the Khmer Rouge regime on 7 January 1979, by Vietnamese and KUFNS forces.]]\n\nOn 14 January 1985, Hun Sen was appointed Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and began peace talks with the factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. Between 2\u20134 December 1987, Hun Sen met with Sihanouk at [[F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois]] in France to discuss the future of Kampuchea. Further talks occurred between 20\u201321 January 1988, and Hun Sen offered Sihanouk a position within the Kampuchean Government on the condition that he returned to Kampuchea straight away.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 104\">Corfield (a), p. 104</ref> However, Sihanouk did not accept the offer, even as preparations were made in Phnom Penh to receive him. Despite that failure, Hun Sen's Kampuchean Government was able to persuade [[Cheng Heng]] and [[In Tam]], both ministers in Lon Nol's regime, to return to Kampuchea.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 104\" /> In the first major step towards restoring peace in Kampuchea, representatives of the CGDK and the PRK met for the first time at the First Jakarta Informal Meeting on 25 July 1988. In that meeting, Sihanouk proposed a three-stage plan, which called for a cease-fire, a UN peacekeeping force to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the integration of all Kampuchean armed factions into a single army.<ref name=\"Haas, p. 131\">Haas, p. 131</ref>\n\nVietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach urged all parties involved to separate Kampuchean problems into internal and external aspects. Therefore, to begin the process of restoring peace, the Vietnamese delegation proposed a two-stage plan that began with internal discussions among the Kampuchean factions, followed by a roundtable discussion with all involved countries. The Vietnamese proposal won out at the meeting, but no agreements were reached.<ref name=\"Haas, p. 131\" /> At the Second Jakarta Meeting, on 19 February 1989, Australian Foreign Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] forwarded the Cambodian Peace Plan to bring about a ceasefire, a peacekeeping force and the establishment of a national unity government to maintain Kampuchea's sovereignty until elections were held.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 104\" /> To facilitate a peace agreement on the eve of the Vietnamese withdrawal, between 29\u201330 April 1989, Hun Sen convened a meeting of the National Assembly to adopt a new constitution, and the country was renamed the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition: State of Cambodia (1989\u20131993)|State of Cambodia]] to reflect the state of ambiguity of the country's sovereignty.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 105\">Corfield (a), p. 105</ref> Furthermore, Buddhism was re-established as the state religion, and citizens were guaranteed the right to hold private property.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 105\" />\n\nIn the meantime, however, peace talks between the warring factions continued, with the First Paris Peace Conference on Cambodia held in Paris in 1989. On 26 February 1990, following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting was held, at which the Supreme National Council was established to safeguard Cambodian sovereignty. Initially, the Supreme National Council was to have 12 members, with three seats allocated to each faction of the CGDK, and three to the pro-Vietnam Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 105\" /> However, Hun Sen objected to the proposed arrangement, calling instead for each faction of the CGDK to be given two seats for a total of six, and the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party to have six seats. In 1991 the Supreme National Council began representing Cambodia at the UN General Assembly. Then, in a bold move, Hun Sen renamed the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party as the [[Cambodian People's Party]] in an effort to portray his party as a democratic institution and renounce its revolutionary struggle.<ref>Corfield (a), p. 106</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 1991, the Cambodian factions of the Supreme National Council, along with Vietnam and 15 member nations of the International Peace Conference on Cambodia, signed the [[1991 Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Agreement]]. For the Cambodian people, two decades of continuous warfare and 13 years of civil war seemed to be over, although an atmosphere of uneasiness amongst the leaders of the Cambodian factions remained.<ref name=\"Spooner, p. 228\">Spooner, p. 228</ref> In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement, the major powers agreed to avoid using the word \"genocide\" to describe the actions of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the period between 1975 and 1979. As a result, Hun Sen criticised the Paris Agreement as being far from perfect, as it failed to remind the Cambodian people of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Spooner, p. 228\" /> Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement established the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC), in accordance with the UN Security Council's Resolution 745,<ref name=\"Deng & Wang, p. 77\">Deng & Wang, p. 77</ref> and gave UNTAC a broad mandate to supervise main policies and administration works until a Cambodian government was democratically elected.<ref>DeRouen & Heo, p. 232</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 1991, Sihanouk returned to Cambodia to participate in the elections, followed by Son Senn, a Khmer Rouge official, who arrived a few days later to set up the organisation's electoral campaign office in Phnom Penh.<ref name=\"Spooner, p. 228\" /> On 27 November 1991, Khieu Samphan also returned to Cambodia on a flight from [[Bangkok]]; initially he had expected his arrival to be uneventful, but as soon as Khieu Samphan's flight landed at [[Pochentong Airport]], he was met by an angry crowd which shouted insults and abuse at him. As Khieu Samphan was driven into the city, another crowd lined the route towards his office and threw objects at his car.<ref>Corfield, p. 108</ref> As soon as he arrived at his office, Khieu Samphan entered and immediately telephoned the Chinese Government to save him. Shortly afterwards, an angry mob forced its way into the building, chased Khieu Samphan up the second floor and tried to hang him from a ceiling fan. Eventually, Khieu Samphan was able to escape from the building by a ladder with his face bloodied, and was immediately taken to Pochentong Airport, where he flew out of Cambodia. With the departure of Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge's participation in the election seemed doubtful.<ref>Corfield, p. 109</ref>\n\nIn March 1992, the start of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which included troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers.<ref name=\"Deng & Wang, p. 77\" /> The mission was led by [[Yasushi Akashi]].<ref>Corfield, p. 110</ref> In June 1992, the Khmer Rouge formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, the Khmer Rouge also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement.<ref>Corfield, p. 111</ref> Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, the Khmer Rouge started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia.<ref>Corfield, p. 112</ref> Towards the end of 1992, Khmer Rouge forces advanced into [[Kampong Thom (city)|Kampong Thom]] in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there. In the months leading up to the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.<ref>Spooner, p. 229</ref>\n\nDespite ongoing threats from the Khmer Rouge during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 percent of the vote, against 38.23 percent for the Cambodian People's Party.<ref>Corfield (a), p. 114</ref> Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen refused to accept the results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, announced the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported the Cambodian People's Party. Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party so the country would not break up. On 21 September 1993, the Cambodian Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister. He appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister.<ref>Corfield (a), p. 115</ref> On 23 September 1993, the [[constitutional monarchy]] was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state.<ref>Corfield, p. 115</ref> In July 1994, the Cambodian Government outlawed the Khmer Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, the Cambodian Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea.<ref>Hammer, p. 22</ref> By 1998, the Khmer Rouge was completely dissolved.<ref>Spooner, p. 236</ref>\n\n=== Vietnam rejoins the world ===\nThe military occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective on foreign policy had been dominated by the need to maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 85\">Largo, p. 85</ref> Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with that view. However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 2</ref> In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations. Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of [[ASEAN]].<ref name=\"Largo, p. 85\" />\n\nIn light of the decline experienced by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, the Vietnamese Government began repairing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries as part of a greater effort to rejuvenate Vietnam's shattered economy. Since its invasion in 1979, China had placed sustained pressure on the northern borders of Vietnam, with the province of Ha Tuyen regularly shelled by Chinese artillery. In September 1985, Chinese bombardment of Ha Tuyen reached a peak when 2,000 rounds were fired.<ref>Thayer, p. 11</ref> To reduce the state of hostility along the border region, and ultimately normalise relations with China, the Vietnamese Government dropped all hostile references to China at the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986, and also adopted the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] policy.<ref>Frost, p. 32</ref> In August 1990, as the Cambodian Peace Plan, authored by Australian Foreign Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], was being endorsed by the UN Security Council, both China and Vietnam moved towards accommodation.<ref name=\"Froster, p. 34\">Froster, p. 34</ref>\n\nEarly in September 1990, Vietnamese Prime Minister [[\u0110\u1ed7 M\u01b0\u1eddi]], general secretary Nguyen Van Linh and former Prime Minister Pham Van Dong travelled to [[Chengdu]], China, where they held a secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister [[Li Peng]] and General Secretary of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] [[Jiang Zemin]]. On 17 September 1990, General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance.<ref name=\"Froster, p. 34\" /> Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n Ki\u1ec7t]] travelled to [[Beijing]] and met his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, and they issued an 11-point communiqu\u00e9 re-establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries after 10 years without formal relations.<ref>Froster, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe end of the Cambodian conflict also brought an end to the ASEAN-imposed trade and aid embargo which had been in place since 1979. In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister [[Chatichai Choonhavan]] publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, and the rest of [[Indochina]], to gain admission into ASEAN.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 3</ref> In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 4</ref> Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats in the post-[[Cold War]] era, when Soviet aid was no longer available.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 7</ref> Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994.<ref name=\"Thayer (a), p. 5\">Thayer (a), p. 5</ref> Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam's isolation from the United States.<ref name=\"Thayer (a), p. 5\" />\n\n=== Environmental impacts ===\nCambodia and Vietnam's forest cover underwent drastic reductions following the end of the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\">Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13</ref> The fall of Khmer Rouge was attributed to Vietnamese troops overthrowing the government and the occupation of Phnom Penh, establishing the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) in 1978.<ref name=\"Vickery, p. 435-465\">Vickery, p. 435-465</ref> With lack of international support by the end of the Cold War, the Khmer Rouge struggled to rebuild itself.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> In an attempt to increase revenue and regain power, they established themselves along the Thailand-Cambodia border in northwestern Cambodia to focus on exploiting Cambodia's natural resources including timber and rubies.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> With 15% of total global tropical forests, Southeast Asia is a leader in timber production.<ref name=\"Stibig et al., p. 247\">Stibig et al., p. 247</ref> This initiative quickly became an race between political factions, as the PRK adopted Khmer Rouge extraction efforts.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" />\n\nFrom 1969 to 1995, Cambodia's forest cover shrank from 73% to 30\u201335%.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> Similarly, Vietnam lost nearly three million hectares of forest cover from 1976 to 1995.<ref name=\"McElwee, p. 97-135\">McElwee, p. 97-135</ref> In 1992, Khmer Rouge became internationally isolated.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> The United Nations Security Council banned all exports of Cambodian timber in November of that year.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\">Salo, p. 127</ref> Efforts to create a neutral electoral environment led to the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTAC) in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Billon, p. 563-586\">Billon, p. 563-586</ref> The move was implemented in January 1993.<ref name=\"Wolf, p. 429\">Wolf, p. 429</ref> In the same year, the Vietnamese issued a logging ban, driving the Khmer Rouge to logging illegally.<ref name=\"McElwee, p. 97-135\" /> Illicit exports from Cambodia to Vietnam was worth US$130&nbsp;million each year.<ref name=\"McElwee, p. 97-135\" />\n\nThailand was the largest violator of UNTAC.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\" /> The Thai government at the time insisted that Cambodian imported timber must have a certificate of origin approved by the governmental authorities in Phnom Penh.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> These certificates cost US$35 for each cubic metre of timber from Khmer Rouge operating areas.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> This forced the Khmer Rouge  to increase prices. They learned to speak Thai and sold timber illegally to Thai timber operators, earning them over US$10&nbsp;million monthly.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\" /> [[Global Witness]], an international human rights and environmental [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) based in London,<ref name=\"Bannon & Collier, p. xv\">Bannon & Collier, p. xv</ref> recognized these timber guerillas when they identified mass Cambodian exports.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\" /> They subsequently lobbied for an amendment to the US Foreign Operations Act.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> The act was passed.

The war began with the repeated attacks by [[Khmer Rouge|Khmer Rouge Army]] on the southwestern border of Vietnam, with the defining moment of [[Ba Chuc massacre]], resulting in the deaths of over 3000 Vietnamese civilians.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/7-facts-didnt-know-cambodian-vietnamese-war.html|website=War History Online|title=A Terrible Conflict \u2013 The Cambodian-Vietnamese War|date=4 November 2016|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref> On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War#Invasion of Kampuchea|full-scale invasion]] of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|government]] of the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]] from power.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], Vietnamese and Cambodian communists had formed an alliance to fight U.S.-backed regimes in their respective countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the [[Khmer Rouge]] leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to preempt an attempt by the Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began [[Purge|purging]] Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the [[Lon Nol]] regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of [[Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c]].{{Citation needed|reason=Need source for the attack on Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c, google only directs here |date=June 2019}}\n\nIn spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. Therefore, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978 the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved; the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to negotiate seriously.\n\nSmall-scale fighting continued between the two countries throughout 1978, as [[China]] tried to mediate peace talks between the two sides. However, neither country would agree to an acceptable compromise. By the end of 1978, Vietnamese leaders decided to remove the Khmer Rouge-dominated regime of Democratic Kampuchea, perceiving it as being pro-Chinese and hostile towards Vietnam. On 25 December 1978, 150,000 Vietnamese troops invaded Democratic Kampuchea and overran the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] in just two weeks, thereby ending the excesses of Pol Pot's regime, which had been responsible for the deaths of almost a quarter of all Cambodians between 1975 and December 1978. Vietnamese military intervention and the occupying forces' subsequent allowing in of international food aid to mitigate the massive famine is viewed as ending the [[Cambodian genocide]].<ref>''New York Times'', August 8, 1979.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,912511,00.html|title=CAMBODIA: Help for the Auschwitz of Asia|date=November 5, 1979|work=[[Time Magazine]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913105748/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,912511,00.html|archive-date=September 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 January 1979 the pro-Vietnamese [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK) was established in [[Phnom Penh]], marking the beginning of a ten-year Vietnamese occupation. During that period, the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea continued to be recognised by the [[United Nations]] as the legitimate government of Kampuchea, as several armed resistance groups were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. Behind the scenes, Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] of the PRK regime approached factions of the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] (CGDK) to begin peace talks. Under diplomatic and economic pressure from the international community, the Vietnamese government implemented a series of economic and foreign policy reforms, which led to their withdrawal from Kampuchea in September 1989.\n\nAt the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990, under the Australian-sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan, representatives of the CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power-sharing arrangement by forming a unity government known as the Supreme National Council (SNC). The SNC's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage, while the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) was tasked with supervising the country's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people. Cambodia's pathway to peace proved to be difficult, as Khmer Rouge leaders decided not to participate in the general elections, but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants. In May 1993, Sihanouk's [[FUNCINPEC]] movement defeated the [[Cambodian People's Party]] (CPP), formerly the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]] (KPRP), to win the general elections. However, the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat, and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia, where most of the CPP's votes were drawn from, would secede from Cambodia. To avoid such an outcome, [[Norodom Ranariddh]], the leader of FUNCINPEC, agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP. Shortly afterwards, the [[Monarchy of Cambodia|constitutional monarchy]] was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian government.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese history ===\n[[Angkor]], the seat of the [[Khmer Empire]], was subjected to Vietnamese influence as early as the 13th century. Vietnamese influence spread gradually and indirectly, and it was not until the early-19th century that Vietnam exercised direct control.<ref>Thus-Huong, p. 6</ref> However, Vietnamese attempts to annex Cambodia began in 17th century when Vietnamese forces helped Cambodian dissidents topple its only Muslim King, [[Ramathipadi I]]. From then on, Vietnam frequently intervened in Cambodia. In 1813, [[Ang Chan II|Nak Ong Chan]] gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a [[protectorate]]. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese \"province\".<ref>Morris, p. 25</ref> Throughout the 1830s, Vietnam attempted to erase [[Khmer culture]], which had derived the basis of Cambodian society, dress, and religion from India rather than China.<ref>SarDesai, p. 7</ref> The trend of Vietnamese dominance continued during French colonisation, under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its southern region (which would later be [[Saigon]], the [[Mekong Delta]] and [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province|T\u00e2y Ninh]]) to the Vietnamese.<ref>Morris, p. 32</ref> The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia had lost during the previous centuries.<ref>Young, p. 305</ref>\n\n=== Rise of communism ===\nThe communist movement in Cambodia and Vietnam began before [[World War II]] with the founding of the [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP), almost exclusively dominated by the Vietnamese, originally meant to fight French colonial rule in [[Indochina]].<ref>Morris, p.&nbsp;159</ref> In 1941, Nguyen Ai Quoc (commonly known by his alias [[Ho Chi Minh]]) founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, or the [[Viet Minh]]. When the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II, he initiated the [[First Indochina War|first Indochinese war of independence]] against the French. During this time, Vietnamese forces made extensive use of Cambodian territory to transport weapons, supplies, and troops. This relationship lasted throughout the [[Vietnam War]], when Vietnamese communists used Cambodia as a transport route and staging area for attacks on South Vietnam. In 1951, Vietnam guided the establishment of a separate Cambodian communist party, the [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]] (KPRP), which allied with a nationalist separatist Cambodian movement, the [[Khmer Serei]] (Free Khmers), in order to pursue independence. In accordance with the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Accords]] negotiating the end of the French domination, newly created communist North Vietnam pulled all of its Viet Minh soldiers and cadres out of Cambodia; however, since the KPRP was staffed primarily by ethnic Vietnamese or Cambodians under its tutelage, approximately 5,000 communist cadres went with them.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 93\">Morris, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe power vacuum the Vietnamese communists left in their wake in Cambodia was soon filled by the return of a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries, many of whom received their communist education in France.<ref>Jackson, p. 246</ref> In 1960, the KPRP changed its name to the [[Kampuchean Communist Party]] (KCP), and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar ([[Pol Pot]]), [[Ieng Sary]], and [[Khieu Samphan]] as the true political institution memorialising the KCP <!--what does this mean, memorialising the KCP???-->. This clique became the genesis of the Khmer Rouge, and its doctrine was heavily influenced by [[Maoist]] ideology.<ref>Jackson, p. 250</ref>\n\n=== Lon Nol's anti-Vietnamese sentiment ===\n{{Main|FULRO}}\nAfter the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|removal of Sihanouk from power]] in March 1970, the leader of the new [[Khmer Republic]], [[Lon Nol]], despite being anti-communist and ostensibly in the \"pro-American\" camp, backed the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races|FULRO]] against all Vietnamese, both anti-communist South Vietnam and the communist [[Viet Cong]]. Lon Nol planned a slaughter of all Vietnamese people in Cambodia and a restoration of South Vietnam to a revived [[Champa]] state. Many were slaughtered and dumped in the [[Mekong River]] at the hands of Lon Nol's anti-communist forces.<ref name=\"Kiernan2008\">{{cite book|author=Ben Kiernan|title=Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500\u20132000|url=https://books.google.com./books?id=R5p7cRyK748C&pg=PA548#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne Univ.

In its place, they hoped to create a classless society based entirely on worker-peasants. The radical ideologies and goals of the Khmer Rouge were alien concepts to the masses.<ref name=\"Young 312\">Young, p. 312</ref> The socialist revolution held very little popular appeal, which led Pol Pot and his cadres to use ultra-nationalist sentiment, repressive and murderous rule, and propaganda aimed at demonising the Vietnamese to maintain control.<ref>Jackson, p. 244</ref>\n\nEven before the Vietnam War ended, the relationship between the Khmer Rouge\u2014which was in the process of seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol\u2014and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the \"friendship\" between the Khmer Rouge and China.<ref>Van der Kroef, p. 29</ref>\n\n== Diplomacy and military action ==\n=== 1975\u20131976: from fighting to building friendly relations ===\n[[File:PolPot.jpg|thumb|[[Pol Pot]] was the leader of the Khmer Rouge. Following the Khmer Rouge victory on 17 April 1975, he became Premier of Democratic Kampuchea and led the country in its war against Vietnam.]]\n\nThe [[Fall of Phnom Penh]] and the [[Fall of Saigon]] in April 1975 immediately brought a new conflict between Vietnam and Cambodia. Although the North Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge had previously fought side by side, the leaders of the newly created [[Democratic Kampuchea]] continued to view Vietnam with great suspicion, because they believed the Vietnamese communists had never given up their dream of creating an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the leader.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\">Farrell, p. 195</ref> For that reason, the Kampuchean government removed all North Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchean territory shortly after their capture of [[Phnom Penh]] on 17 April 1975. In the first major clash between the two former allies, the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] (KRA) invaded the Vietnamese island of [[Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c]] on 1 May 1975 (barely 24 hours after Saigon fell), claiming it was part of Kampuchea's territory.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" />\n\nNine days later, on 10 May 1975, the KRA continued its incursion by capturing the [[Th\u1ed5 Chu Islands]], where it executed 500 Vietnamese civilians. The Vietnamese military immediately responded to Kampuchean actions by launching a counterattack and removing Kampuchean forces from Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c and Th\u1ed5 Chu, and then invading the Kampuchean island of [[Koh Poulo Wai]].<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" /> In June 1975, while on a visit to [[Hanoi]], Pol Pot proposed that Vietnam and his country should sign a treaty of friendship and begin discussions on border disputes. However, those discussions never materialised, and the Kampucheans claimed that Vietnam turned down both offers.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" /> In August 1975, Vietnam returned the island of Koh Poulo Wai to Kampuchea and formally recognised Kampuchean sovereignty over the island.<ref name=\"Farrell, p. 195\" />\n\nFollowing those incidents, both countries attempted to improve their diplomatic relations with a series of congratulatory messages and exchange visits. On 17 April 1976, Vietnamese leaders sent a message to congratulate Khieu Samphan, [[Nuon Chea]] and Pol Pot on their \"elections\" as President, President of the People's Representatives and Premier of Kampuchea, respectively.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 93\" /> Furthermore, the Vietnamese even denounced the alleged \"U.S. bombing\" of [[Siem Reap]] in February 1976, thereby reinforcing the Kampucheans' fictitious claims over the incident.<ref>Morris, pp.&nbsp;93\u201394.</ref> In response, in June 1976, the Kampuchean leadership sent a message to the [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam]], which had governed South Vietnam since the fall of Saigon, congratulating them on the seventh anniversary of their establishment.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 94\">Morris, p. 94</ref>\n\nIn July 1976, following the establishment of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] as a reunified country, Phnom Penh Radio broadcast a commentary which proclaimed the \"militant solidarity and friendship between peoples of Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam grow constantly greener and sturdier\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 94\" /> However, during that same month, Pol Pot publicly hinted at tensions between Vietnam and Kampuchea when he told a visiting Vietnamese media delegation that there were \"obstacles and difficulties\" in the relationship between the two countries.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 95\">Morris, p.&nbsp;95.</ref> Nonetheless, on 21 September 1976, the first air service connecting Hanoi and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] with Phnom Penh was established. Then in December 1976, the Kampuchean Revolutionary Organisation sent greetings to the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]] during their [[4th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Fourth Congress]].<ref name=\"Morris, p. 94\" />\n\n=== 1977: build-up to war ===\nTowards the end of 1976, while Vietnam and Kampuchea publicly appeared to be improving their relationships, the private suspicions of both countries' leadership grew. From the Vietnamese perspective, they were the patrons of genuine [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] revolutions in Southeast Asia, so it was vital for them to exercise control over the Kampucheans and the Laotians.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 97\">Morris, p. 97</ref> Indeed, that was the reason North Vietnam supported the Khmer Rouge during their fight against the Lon Nol regime, in the hope that the Kampuchean communists would adopt a pro-Vietnamese line upon their victory in the same way as the [[Pathet Lao]] had done. However, their hopes were dashed as early as 1973, because [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) formations operating in Khmer Rouge-occupied territories were occasionally subjected to armed attacks by their allies. The Vietnamese position inside Kampuchea was further weakened after the end of the war, as there were no pro-Vietnamese elements left within the Kampuchean Communist Party.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 96\">Morris, p. 96</ref>\n\nWhen the pro-Chinese Pol Pot and his brother-in-law Ieng Sary resigned from their respective positions as premier and foreign minister in September 1976, Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] and General Secretary of the Communist Party [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]] were optimistic that Vietnam could exercise greater influence on the Kampucheans. In a private meeting with the Soviet ambassador to Vietnam on 16 November 1976, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n dismissed both Ieng Sary and Pol Pot as \"bad people\" for their pro-Chinese policies.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 96\" /> Le Duan then asserted that Nuon Chea, who had ascended to the position of Premier of Democratic Kampuchea as Pol Pot's replacement, was a person of pro-Vietnamese orientation, so Vietnam could exercise its influence through him. However, the events which developed over the next few months would prove L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n had been mistaken in his assessment of Nuon Chea.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 96\" />\n\nMeanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the Kampuchean leadership had developed a fear and hatred of the Vietnamese leadership as a result of Vietnam's historical dominance over their country. From the Kampuchean perspective, the Vietnamese strategy to dominate Indochina involved infiltrating the communist parties of Kampuchea and Laos with Vietnamese-trained cadres.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 97\" /> For that reason, when the first group of North Vietnamese-trained Khmer Rouge personnel returned to the country, they were immediately purged from the KCP. During the months following the defeat of the Lon Nol regime, Pol Pot continued to purge the KCP and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea of those who he believed to be Soviet and Vietnamese agents. Then, in the context of the triumphalism that prevailed among the Khmer Rouge leadership\u2014they claimed they had single-handedly defeated the \"American imperialists\"\u2014Democratic Kampuchea began preparing for war against Vietnam.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 98\">Morris, p. 98</ref>\n\nAs the KRA made preparations for its war against Vietnam, state-controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory messages to the Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on the second anniversary of its establishment, on 17 April 1977. On 30 April 1977, the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the Kampuchean reply came in the form of a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of [[An Giang Province|An Giang]] and [[Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c]], killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 98\" /> The PAVN responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a [[demilitarised zone]] between the opposing forces.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 36</ref>\n\nBoth sides ignored each other's proposals, and the KRA continued sending soldiers across the border to attack Vietnamese towns and villages. In September 1977, KRA artillery struck several Vietnamese villages along the border, and six villages in [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province]] were overrun by Kampuchean infantry. Shortly afterwards, six divisions of the KRA advanced about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} into [[Tay Ninh Province]], where they killed more than 1,000 Vietnamese civilians.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\">O'Dowd, p. 37</ref> Angered by the scale of Kampuchean assaults, the PAVN assembled eight divisions, estimated at around 60,000 soldiers, to launch a retaliatory strike against Kampuchea. On 16 December 1977, the PAVN divisions, with support from elements of the [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], crossed the border along several axes with the objective of forcing the Kampuchean Government to negotiate.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" />\n\nOn the battlefield, the KRA quickly lost ground to the Vietnamese. By the end of December 1977, Vietnam had won a clear military victory over Kampuchea, as Vietnamese formations marched through [[Svay Rieng Province]] and only stopped short of entering the provincial capital. Despite the ferocity of the Vietnamese retaliation, the Kampuchean Government remained defiant.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /> On 31 December 1977, Khieu Sampham declared that the Kampuchean Government would \"temporarily\" sever diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the Vietnamese military withdrew from the \"sacred territory of Democratic Kampuchea\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 102\">Morris, p. 102</ref> On 6 January 1978, PAVN divisions were only {{convert|38|km|abbr=on}} from Phnom Penh, but the Vietnamese Government decided to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea because they had failed to achieve Vietnam's political objective. During the withdrawal, the PAVN also evacuated thousands of prisoners and civilian refugees, including future leader [[Hun Sen]].<ref name=\"Morris, p. 102\" />\n\n=== 1978: preparations for regime change ===\n[[File:FUNSK-emblem.JPG|thumb|Emblem of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]]\nInstead of being sobered by the Vietnamese show of force, the Kampuchean government boasted that the Vietnamese withdrawal was a major victory for Democratic Kampuchea, comparing it to the \"defeat of U.S. imperialism\" on 17 April 1975. The Kampucheans went on further to proclaim that \"our 6 January victory over the annexationist, Vietnamese aggressor enemy has given all of us greater confidence in the forces of our people and nation, in our Kampuchean Communist Party and our Kampuchean Revolutionary Army, and in our Party's line of people's war\".<ref name=\"Morris, p. 103\" /> The Kampuchean leadership claimed that one Kampuchean soldier was equal to 30 Vietnamese soldiers, so if Kampuchea could raise two million soldiers from a population of eight million, it could wipe out Vietnam's population of 50 million and still have six million people left.<ref>Morris, p. 104</ref> In reality, Kampuchean leaders simply ignored the condition of the population in their own country and Vietnam; the Vietnamese, though poor, were in good physical condition, while Kampuchea's population was physically and mentally exhausted from years of hard labour, starvation and disease.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 103\" />\n\nIn addition to the disparity in population, there was also a great disparity between the fighting capabilities of the armed forces of the two countries. In 1977, Vietnam was estimated to have 615,000 soldiers and 900 tanks, supported by a 12,000-member air force with 300 combat aircraft, including one squadron of light bombers. In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles and limited air capability.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 103\" /> Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam's border regions. In January 1978, KRA forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in [[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]] Province.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /> On 27 January 1978, Vietnam started calling on the KRA along the border regions to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" />\n\nAgainst the backdrop of military clashes, between 9 January and 20 February 1978, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Phan Hien made several trips to [[Beijing]] to hold discussions with representatives of the Kampuchean government, which ultimately proved to be fruitless. On 18 January 1978, China attempted to mediate between Kampuchea and Vietnam when Vice Premier [[Deng Yingchao]] travelled to Phnom Penh, where she was met with strong resistance by Kampuchean leaders.<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 124\">Khoo, p. 124</ref> Meanwhile, Vietnamese government officials began conducting secret meetings with [[So Phim]], the Khmer Rouge leader in Kampuchea's Eastern Military Zone, to plan a military uprising backed by Vietnam. During that same period, military setbacks experienced by the KRA in the Eastern Military Zone prompted Pol Pot to label the region as a \"nest of traitors\".<ref>Morris, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[File:H\u00e0i c\u1ed1t.jpg|thumb|left|Skulls of victims of the [[Ba Ch\u00fac Massacre]]]]\nIn order to purge the Eastern Military Zone of those he perceived to have been contaminated by the Vietnamese, Pol Pot ordered military units from the Southwest Zone to move into eastern Kampuchea and eliminate the \"hidden traitors\". Unable to withstand an attack from the Kampuchea Government, So Phim committed suicide while his deputy [[Heng Samrin]] defected to Vietnam.<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 124\" /> On 12 April 1978, the Kampuchean government declared they and Vietnam could negotiate again if the Vietnamese gave up their expansionist ambitions and recognised Kampuchea's sovereignty.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /> However, there was also a pre-condition requiring Vietnam to meet several obligations through a seven-month trial ceasefire. The Vietnamese government immediately rejected the demand. In response, two KRA divisions penetrated up to {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} into Vietnamese territory and [[Ba Ch\u00fac massacre|massacred]] over 3,000 Vietnamese civilians in the village of [[Ba Ch\u00fac]] in An Giang Province.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" />\n\nIn June 1978, the VPAF started bombing KRA positions along the border regions, flying about 30 bombing sorties per day and inflicting heavy casualties on the Kampucheans. By that stage in the conflict, most surviving leaders of the Eastern Military Zone had escaped into Vietnam, where they assembled at various secret camps with the purpose of forming a Vietnamese-backed \"liberation army\" to fight against the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 107\">Morris, p. 107</ref> Meanwhile, the Vietnamese Communist Party Politburo was meeting in Hanoi to discuss its strategy for Kampuchea. It concluded that the Khmer Rouge regime was a proxy of China, which had been trying to fill the power vacuum following the withdrawal of the United States. As such, China was identified as Vietnam's main enemy, and its client regime in Phnom Penh had to be removed by conventional military force, because the Vietnamese adaptation of the Maoist \"[[people's war]]\" doctrine had not been a success against the Khmer Rouge's security apparatus.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 37\" /><ref name=\"Morris, p. 107\" />\n\nTo reflect the attitude of the country's leaders, Vietnam's state-controlled media stepped up its propaganda war against the Khmer Rouge, with the official ''[[Nh\u00e2n D\u00e2n]]'' newspaper regularly calling for international intervention to save the Kampuchean people from domestic terror initiated by the Khmer Rouge regime. Furthermore, instead of sending congratulatory messages as they had done in the previous years, the Vietnamese media changed their tone and began referring to the Kampuchean Government as the \"Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique\" as the Kampuchean military continued their campaign in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 107\" /> By the end of June, the Vietnamese military assembled a multi-division task force to launch another limited-objective campaign against the Kampucheans. Again, the Vietnamese pushed the KRA forces back into the provincial cities of [[Suong]] and [[Prey Veng (city)|Prey Veng]] and then pulled out. However, as they had done before, the KRA moved its artillery back towards the border and continued shelling Vietnamese villages as though nothing had happened.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\">O'Dowd, p. 38</ref>\n\nDuring the second half of 1978, Vietnamese leaders devoted much of their energy towards the military campaign against the Khmer Rouge regime, by seeking political support from the Soviet Union. In a briefing with Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials on 25 July 1978, the Soviet [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in Hanoi was told that the Kampuchean Government had deployed 14 of its 17 regular army divisions and 16 local regiments along the border with Vietnam.<ref>Morris, p. 108</ref> Then, in early September 1978, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n informed the Soviet ambassador that Vietnam aimed to \"solve fully this question of Kampuchea by the beginning of 1979\". While Vietnam was laying the political foundation for the military campaign against Kampuchea, Soviet ships were reported to be unloading military hardware and ammunition in [[Cam Ranh Bay]].<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> In October 1978, Vietnamese radio broadcast what they claimed were accounts of uprisings against the Khmer Rouge regime, urging members of the KRA either to overthrow the \"Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique\" or defect to Vietnam.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 110\">Morris, p. 110</ref>\n\nIn a major turning point in the course of Soviet-Vietnamese and Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relations, and ultimately the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed between Vietnam and the Soviet Union on 3 November 1978, which guaranteed the former of vital Soviet military aid in the scenario that China intervened in the conflict.<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 127\" /> Later, in November 1978, a command and control headquarters was established for the planned invasion of Kampuchea, with Senior General [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Anh]] taking full control of PAVN units along the border areas. The Vietnamese government drafted 350,000 men into the military to replace earlier losses and augment its units along the border. While the new recruits were completing training, ten divisions were deployed to the border regions of [[Long An Province|Long An]], \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and T\u00e2y Ninh Provinces. Vietnam also shifted three divisions based in Laos south towards the Laos-Kampuchea border.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> On 13 December 1978, the Chinese Government warned Vietnam that its patience was limited, and that Vietnam would be punished if it behaved in an \"unbridled fashion\".<ref name=\"Khoo, p. 127\" />\n\nNonetheless, the final piece of the Vietnamese strategy emerged when Vietnam announced the formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS) in the \"liberation zones\" of Kampuchea.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> Hanoi claimed that KUFNS was an independent Kampuchean communist movement, with members drawn from all walks of life. Heng Samrin, formerly a member of the Khmer Rouge and commander of the KRA 4th Division, was the chairman of the KUFNS Central Committee.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 110\" /> Previously, the KUFNS was known as the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Kampuchea (PRGK), which consisted of 300 former Khmer Rouge cadres who defected to Vietnam. The PRGK regularly sent representatives abroad in search of support, before Vietnam abandoned the \"people's war\" concept in favour of a conventional military campaign.<ref>IBP USA, p. 69</ref>\n\nNot to be outdone by the Vietnamese military build-up, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was busy strengthening its armed forces with Chinese support. In previous years, China had only provided the KRA with a limited quantities of arms and ammunition, but as relations with Vietnam worsened in 1978, Beijing established additional supply routes through Kampuchea and increased the volume of military hardware which travelled down each route.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> On the eve of the Vietnamese invasion, Kampuchea had an estimated 73,000 soldiers in the Eastern Military Zone bordering Vietnam.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" /> At that time, all branches of the Kampuchean armed forces were significantly strengthened by large quantities of Chinese-made military equipment, which included fighter aircraft, patrol boats, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, trucks and tanks. Additionally, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese advisers in both military and civilian capacities, providing their support to the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"O'Dowd, p. 38\" />\n\n== {{Anchor|Invasion of Kampuchea}}Invasion of Kampuchea ==\nOn 21 December 1978, Kampuchea's new-found strength was tested when a Vietnamese offensive, consisting of two divisions, crossed the border and moved towards the town of [[Krati\u00e9 (town)|Kratie]], while other support divisions were deployed along local routes to cut off the logistical tail of Kampuchean units.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 111\">Morris, p. 111</ref> Despite enjoying generous support from China, the KRA could not withstand the Vietnamese offensive and suffered heavy casualties.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 40</ref> Finally, on 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion using 13 divisions, estimated at 150,000 soldiers well-supported by heavy artillery and air power.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia3-3.htm \"1978\u20131979 \u2013 Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528154408/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/cambodia3-3.htm |date=2017-05-28 }}, ''Globalsecurity.com''</ref> Initially, Kampuchea directly challenged Vietnam's military might through conventional fighting methods, but this tactic resulted in the loss of half of the KRA within two weeks. Heavy defeats on the battlefield prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country.<ref name=\"Morris, p. 111\" /> On 7 January 1979, the PAVN entered Phnom Penh along with members of the KUFNS. On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese Kampuchean state, known as the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as the Chief of State and [[Pen Sovan]] as General Secretary of the newly refounded [[Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party]].<ref name=\"Morris, p. 111\" />\n\nThe Khmer Rouge leadership, with much of its political and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in [[Thailand]], where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in [[Trat Province]].<ref>Martin, p. 216</ref> Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country's economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered by the lack of educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime's attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating in the western regions of the country.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 99\">Swann, p. 99</ref>\n\n=== International response ===\nShortly after the capture of Phnom Penh, representatives of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] called for an emergency meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]], so Prince Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\">Swann, p. 98</ref> Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea's sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" /> Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by China, [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. However, the resolution was not approved due to opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.\n\nBetween 16\u201319 February 1979 Vietnam and the new Kampuchean regime held a summit meeting which concluded with the two countries signing a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 97\">Swann, p. 97</ref> Article 2 of the treaty stated that the security of Vietnam and Kampuchea were interrelated; thus they would help defend each other \"against schemes and acts of sabotage by the imperialist and international reactionary forces\", thereby legitimising the presence of Vietnamese troops on Kampuchean soil.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" /> Soon afterwards, the Soviet Union, the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and India recognised the Vietnamese-installed People's Republic of Kampuchea. The Soviet government praised the PRK's \"remarkable victory\" and expressed its full support for the regime's advance towards socialism. Furthermore, the Soviets harshly criticised the Khmer Rouge regime's record of terror, which they implied had been imposed by China.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" />\n\nAt the 34th Session of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council that it was the sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 97\" /> In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China.<ref>White, p. 123</ref> By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam's use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" />\n\nThailand, which shared an 800-kilometer (500 mile) border with Kampuchea and has historically feared Vietnam's expansionism, demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention. [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Singapore]] showed their support for Thailand's position.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" /> Furthermore, ASEAN viewed Vietnam's invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea, which received strong Soviet support, as an intolerable threat to the region's security and stability.<ref>Jones & Smith, p. 53</ref> That view was shared by China, which went as far as accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony. The United States, which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea, showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly, and echoed ASEAN's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 98\" />\n\nIn addition, [[North Korea]], whose leader [[Kim Il-sung]] had offered Sihanouk sanctuary after he was ousted by Lon Nol in 1970, also refused to recognize the People's Republic of Kampuchea.<ref name=DPRK-CGDK>Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency.

The following day, China announced that it would not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting unexpectedly harsh resistance by well-trained Vietnamese forces equipped with Soviet and captured American weapons. Furthermore, Vietnam's politburo had ordered a general mobilization and begun planning for full conscription. The Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces.<ref>Mei p. 78</ref> Although China failed either to decisively win the 27-day conflict or to force a withdrawal of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription.<ref>Slocomb, p. 260</ref> China's stationing of a large force on the border and engaging in border skirmishes [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts, 1979\u20131991|during subsequent conflicts]] also required Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border throughout the 1980s.\n\n== KPNLF insurgency ==\n[[File:Cambodia anti-PRK border camps.png|thumb|Border camps hostile to the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|PRK]]; 1979\u20131984. KPNLF camps shown in black.]]\n\nWhen the Khmer Rouge regime was removed from power in January 1979, the Kampuchean people hoped that peace and liberty would return to their country. This was reinforced by the Constitution of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, proclaimed in 1981, which specifically stated that Kampuchea was an independent, peaceful state where power belonged to the people.<ref>Peaslee, p. 452</ref> However, there was a deep contrast between what was written in the constitution and reality, because the Kampuchean people began to despair at what they viewed as the Vietnamese occupation of their country, rather than a liberation that had freed them from the brutality of Democratic Kampuchea. That perception was reinforced by the presence of Vietnamese advisers who worked at every level of Heng Samrin's Kampuchean Government. In 1986, for example, there was one Vietnamese adviser for every Kampuchean cabinet minister and one adviser for each one of their three deputy ministers. Furthermore, it was reported that final decisions made by a Kampuchean minister had to receive final approval from the Vietnamese adviser, who usually dictated policies.<ref>Martin, p. 217</ref> Opposition to the Vietnamese was further fomented by human rights abuses committed by the Vietnamese and their allies. To fulfill its [[K5 Plan]], a construction project to strengthen the Cambodia-Thai border, the PRK government conscripted 380,000 people, with large numbers succumbing to malaria.<ref>Etcheson 2005, pp. 24, 27</ref> [[Claude Malhuret]] of [[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res]] reported that a tactic the Vietnamese and KPRAF used to fight the Khmer Rouge was to withhold food from areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge. Thousands of tons of food provided by international relief organizations spoiled on the docks of [[Kompong Som]]. Food sent by aid organisations was often instead used to feed Vietnamese troops and Cambodians living under Vietnamese control.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128201614/http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf |archivedate=28 January 2017|url=http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf|title=The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan: The Consequences for Afghanistan and the Soviet Union|publisher=Medecins sans Fronti\u00e8res |page=427 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo resist the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea and the regime which they installed, the Khmer Rouge called on the Kampuchean people to unite and fight the Vietnamese. However, due to the brutality which they had experienced under the deposed regime, many Kampucheans believed that any political movement aimed at restoring national freedom must oppose both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 107\">Swann, p. 107</ref> In response to such preconditions, two non-communist movements were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. The first group, a right-wing and pro-Western organisation, was formed in October 1979 by former Prime Minister [[Son Sann]] and was called the [[Khmer People's National Liberation Front]] (KPNLF). The KPNLF operated from several [[refugee camp]]s on the Thai-Cambodian border, where it controlled thousands of civilians.<ref>Corfield, p. 9.</ref> At its peak, the armed branch of the KPNLF were estimated to have between 12,000 and 15,000 fighters, but a third of that number were lost through fighting and desertions during the [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand#1985|Vietnamese dry season offensive]] of 1984\u20131985. Nonetheless, the KPNLF continued to operate in small groups, harassing the Vietnamese and their Kampuchean allies using guerrilla tactics.<ref>Swann, p. 108</ref>\n\nThe other non-communist organisation was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, formed by Sihanouk and known by its French acronym [[FUNCINPEC]].<ref>Swann, pp. 108\u2013109</ref> The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the Khmer Rouge following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer Rouge representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea's seat at the UN vacant on the basis that neither the Khmer Rouge nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 106\">Swann, p. 106</ref> He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition of the Khmer Rouge, and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.<ref>Swann, pp. 106\u2013108</ref>\n\nIn the early days of the Vietnamese occupation, Kampuchean resistance groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure from the international community to reform itself. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\">Swann, p. 103</ref> The idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" />\n\nIn August 1981, unity talks between the three organizations appeared to have collapsed as a result of conflicting interests. Sihanouk, who feared the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge, proposed that all resistance groups disarm themselves following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. Meanwhile, Son Sann demanded that the KPNLF be the lead organization within the proposed alliance, and the leaders of the Khmer Rouge \"most compromised\" by the atrocities in Kampuchea be exiled to China.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" /> Against these preconditions, Khieu Samphan reminded his rivals that the autonomy of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea should not be undermined.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 104\">Swann, p. 104</ref> On 22 November 1982, Singapore, with the backing of ASEAN, proposed that three organizations form a coalition government with equal decision-making powers within the alliance. Singapore's proposal was welcomed by Sihanouk, who believed it was a fair deal for the non-communist movements.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 104\" /> Khieu Samphan, on the other hand, rejected that idea, viewing it as an attempt by Sihanouk and Son Sann to isolate the Khmer Rouge. However, Sihanouk knew that Chinese support would not be made available to the FUNCINPEC unless he made some compromises and joined the Khmer Rouge on their terms.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" /> So, in February 1982, Sihanouk met with Khieu Samphan in Beijing to work out their differences. In what he described as \"another concession\", Khieu Samphan proposed forming a coalition government without integrating the other resistance groups into institutions associated with Democratic Kampuchea. However, he emphasized that all parties must defend the legal status of Democratic Kampuchea as the legitimate state representing Kampuchea on the world stage.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 104\" /> In May 1982, with the urging of Sihanouk, Son Sann decided to form a coalition government with the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 103\" />\n\nOn 22 June 1982, leaders of the three organizations formalised the formation of their coalition government by signing a Thai-sponsored agreement which established the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] (CGDK). Accordingly, the CGDK's Inner Cabinet consisted of Sihanouk as the President of Democratic Kampuchea, Khieu Samphan as the Vice-President in charge of foreign affairs and Son Sann as Prime Minister. Below the Inner Cabinet were six separate committees responsible for national defence, economy and finance, social affairs and public health, military affairs and the media.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 105\">Swann, p. 105</ref> During a meeting between [[Kim Il-sung]] and Sihanouk on 10 April 1986, in [[Pyongyang]], Kim Il-Sung reassured Sihanouk that North Korea would continue to regard him as the legitimate [[head of state]] of Kampuchea.<ref name=DPRK-CGDK /> By 1987, Democratic Kampuchea still held its membership at the UN General Assembly, even though it lacked four criteria of statehood: people, territory, government, and supreme authority within the borders of a country.<ref name=\"Swann, p. 106\" /> In spite of those limitations, forces of the three armed factions within the CGDK continued to fight the Vietnamese to achieve their objective of \"bring[ing] about the implementation of the International Conference on Cambodia and other relevant UN General Assembly resolutions\".<ref name=\"Swann, p. 105\" />\n\n== Vietnamese reform and withdrawal ==\n[[File:Cambodia-mountainsW5.JPG|thumb|Mountains along the Cambodian-Thai Border north of the road between [[Serei Saophoan]] and [[Aranyaprathet]]. These were one of the areas where Khmer Rouge fighters hid at the time of the [[K5 Plan]].]]\n\nWhen the Vietnamese leaders launched their invasion of Kampuchea to remove the Khmer Rouge regime in 1978, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that they had severely miscalculated international sympathies toward their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese use of force against Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\">Thayer, p. 10</ref> Thus, Kampuchea became more than just a military problem for Vietnam, quickly evolving into an economic and diplomatic problem in the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed on the periphery of the international community.<ref name=\"Broyle, p. 115\">Broyle, p. 115</ref>\n\nThe international community's political stance towards Kampuchea had a severe impact on the Vietnamese economy, which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts. The United States, which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam, convinced other countries of the United Nations to deprive Vietnam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea of much-needed funds by denying them membership to major international organisations such as the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>Morley & Nishihara, p. 204</ref> In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending all economic aid to Vietnam, and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea, the Sino-Soviet rivalry and the problem of the [[boat people]].<ref>Shiraishi, p. 103</ref> [[Sweden]], which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West, also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as virtually every other country cancelled its aid.<ref name=\"Broyle, p. 115\" />\n\nIn addition to external pressure, domestic policies implemented by the Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven to be largely ineffective in stimulating the country's economic growth. By building on the Soviet model of [[centrally planned economy|central economic planning]], Vietnam placed most emphasis on the development of heavy industries, while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 2\">Largo, p. 2</ref> Furthermore, attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos, as economic output was driven down by dislocation of the general population. In addition to those failed economic policies, Vietnam maintained the fifth-largest armed forces in the world, with 1.26&nbsp;million regular soldiers under arms, 180,000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984.<ref>Thayer, p. 2</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kelemen|first=Paul|title=Soviet Strategy in Southeast Asia: The Vietnam Factor|journal=[[Asian Survey]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|volume=24|issue=3|page=341|date=March 1984|issn=0004-4687|jstor=2644070 |doi=10.1525/as.1984.24.3.01p0146p}}</ref> Consequently, the Vietnamese Government had to spend one-third of its budget on the military and the campaign in Kampuchea, despite receiving US$1.2&nbsp;billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union, thus further hampering Vietnam's economic rebuilding efforts.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 2\" />\n\n[[File:Cambodia\u2013Vietnam Friendship Monument.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cambodia\u2013Vietnam Friendship Monument]]\n\nIn response to international pressure, and to avoid engaging in a debilitating conflict with various local armed resistance groups, Vietnam began withdrawing its military forces from Kampuchea as early as 1982. But the withdrawal process lacked international verification, so foreign observers simply dismissed Vietnam's movement of troops as mere rotations.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 18\" /> In 1984, in order to disengage from Kampuchea, Vietnam unveiled a five-phase strategy known as the [[K5 Plan]]. The plan was authored by General Le Duc Anh, who had led the Vietnamese campaign in Kampuchea. The first phase required the Vietnamese military to capture the bases of armed groups in western Kampuchea and along the border with Thailand. The following phases included sealing off the border with Thailand, destroying local resistance groups, providing security for the population, and building up the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\" /> Foreign observers believed that the Vietnamese Army completed the first phase of the K5 Plan during the dry season offensive of 1984\u201385, when the base camps of several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups were overrun. Afterwards, the majority of ten Vietnamese divisions were assigned to operations on the frontiers, with the remainder staying in major provinces to protect the local population and to train the Kampuchean armed forces.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\" />\n\nBy 1985, international isolation and economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely more and more on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided US$1.4&nbsp;billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at US$1.7&nbsp;billion in the period between 1981 and 1985.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 197\">Largo, p. 197</ref> Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981\u20131985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of US$5.4&nbsp;billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached US$1.8&nbsp;billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90% of Vietnam's demand for raw materials and 70% of its grain imports.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 197\" /> Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 197\" /> In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20% of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.<ref>Faure & Schwab, p. 58</ref>\n\n[[File:Phnom Penh 1989.jpg|thumb|left|10 years of the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea officially ended on 26 September 1989, when the last remaining contingent of Vietnamese troops were pulled out. The departing Vietnamese soldiers received much publicity and fanfare as they moved through [[Phnom Penh]], the capital of [[Kampuchea]].]]\n\nTo reengage with the international community, and to deal with the economic challenges brought by the changes in the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Europe]], Vietnamese leaders decided to embark on a series of reforms. At the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th National Party Congress]] in December 1986, newly appointed General Secretary of the VCP [[Nguyen Van Linh]] introduced a major reform known as [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]], the Vietnamese term for \"renovation\", in order to fix Vietnam's economic problems.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 199\">McCargo, p. 199</ref> However, Vietnamese leaders concluded that Vietnam's dire economic situation came as a result of the international isolation which followed its invasion of Kampuchea in 1978, and that for \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi to be successful it needed radical changes in defence and foreign policy.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 197\">McCargo, p. 197</ref> Subsequently, in June 1987, the Vietnamese Politburo adopted a new defence strategy in Resolution No. 2, calling for the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers from international duties, a reduction in the size of the army through a discharge of 600,000 soldiers and the establishment of a set ratio for military expenditures.<ref>Thayer, p. 15</ref>\n\nThen, on 13 May 1988, the Vietnamese Politburo adopted Resolution No. 13 on foreign policy, which aimed to achieve diversification and multilateralisation of Vietnam's foreign relations. Its main objectives were to end the embargoes imposed by UN members, integrate Vietnam with the regional and international community, and ultimately attract foreign investment and development aid.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 197\" /> As part of this change, Vietnam ceased to regard the United States as a long-term foe and China as an imminent and dangerous enemy. In addition, official Vietnamese propaganda stopped labeling ASEAN as a \"[[NATO]]-type\" organisation.<ref name=\"McCargo, p. 199\" /> To implement the new reforms, Vietnam, with support from the Soviet Union, started transferring several years' worth of military equipment to the KPRAF, which numbered more than 70,000 soldiers. The Vietnamese Ministry of Defense's International Relations Department then advised its Kampuchean counterparts to only use the available equipment to maintain their current level of operations, and not to engage in major operations which could exhaust those supplies.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 18\">Thayer, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Vietnam was estimated to have about 100,000 troops in Kampuchea, but, sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach, the Vietnamese Government began withdrawing forces in earnest. Between April and July 1989, 24,000 Vietnamese soldiers returned home. Then, between 21 and 26 September 1989, after suffering 15,000 soldiers killed and another 30,000 wounded during the 10-year occupation,<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 10\" /> Vietnam's commitment to Kampuchea was officially over, when the remaining 26,000 Vietnamese soldiers were pulled out.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 18\" /> However, armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese-installed PRK regime claimed that Vietnamese troops were still operating on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989. For example, non-communist groups engaging in land-grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite Vietnamese Special Forces near Tamar Puok along Route 69.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 19\">Thayer, p. 19</ref> Then, in March 1991, Vietnamese units were reported to have re-entered [[Kampot Province]] to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 19\" /> Despite such claims, on 23 October 1991, the Vietnamese Government signed the [[1991 Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Agreement]], which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea.<ref name=\"Thayer, p. 19\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Paris Peace Agreement ===\n{{Main|1991 Paris Peace Accords}}\n[[File:Vietnam Cambodia Friendshiip Monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Cambodia\u2013Vietnam Friendship Monument]] was constructed to commemorate the ousting of the Khmer Rouge regime on 7 January 1979, by Vietnamese and KUFNS forces.]]\n\nOn 14 January 1985, Hun Sen was appointed Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and began peace talks with the factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. Between 2\u20134 December 1987, Hun Sen met with Sihanouk at [[F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois]] in France to discuss the future of Kampuchea. Further talks occurred between 20\u201321 January 1988, and Hun Sen offered Sihanouk a position within the Kampuchean Government on the condition that he returned to Kampuchea straight away.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 104\">Corfield (a), p. 104</ref> However, Sihanouk did not accept the offer, even as preparations were made in Phnom Penh to receive him. Despite that failure, Hun Sen's Kampuchean Government was able to persuade [[Cheng Heng]] and [[In Tam]], both ministers in Lon Nol's regime, to return to Kampuchea.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 104\" /> In the first major step towards restoring peace in Kampuchea, representatives of the CGDK and the PRK met for the first time at the First Jakarta Informal Meeting on 25 July 1988. In that meeting, Sihanouk proposed a three-stage plan, which called for a cease-fire, a UN peacekeeping force to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the integration of all Kampuchean armed factions into a single army.<ref name=\"Haas, p. 131\">Haas, p. 131</ref>\n\nVietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach urged all parties involved to separate Kampuchean problems into internal and external aspects. Therefore, to begin the process of restoring peace, the Vietnamese delegation proposed a two-stage plan that began with internal discussions among the Kampuchean factions, followed by a roundtable discussion with all involved countries. The Vietnamese proposal won out at the meeting, but no agreements were reached.<ref name=\"Haas, p. 131\" /> At the Second Jakarta Meeting, on 19 February 1989, Australian Foreign Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] forwarded the Cambodian Peace Plan to bring about a ceasefire, a peacekeeping force and the establishment of a national unity government to maintain Kampuchea's sovereignty until elections were held.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 104\" /> To facilitate a peace agreement on the eve of the Vietnamese withdrawal, between 29\u201330 April 1989, Hun Sen convened a meeting of the National Assembly to adopt a new constitution, and the country was renamed the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition: State of Cambodia (1989\u20131993)|State of Cambodia]] to reflect the state of ambiguity of the country's sovereignty.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 105\">Corfield (a), p. 105</ref> Furthermore, Buddhism was re-established as the state religion, and citizens were guaranteed the right to hold private property.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 105\" />\n\nIn the meantime, however, peace talks between the warring factions continued, with the First Paris Peace Conference on Cambodia held in Paris in 1989. On 26 February 1990, following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting was held, at which the Supreme National Council was established to safeguard Cambodian sovereignty. Initially, the Supreme National Council was to have 12 members, with three seats allocated to each faction of the CGDK, and three to the pro-Vietnam Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Corfield (a), p. 105\" /> However, Hun Sen objected to the proposed arrangement, calling instead for each faction of the CGDK to be given two seats for a total of six, and the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party to have six seats. In 1991 the Supreme National Council began representing Cambodia at the UN General Assembly. Then, in a bold move, Hun Sen renamed the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party as the [[Cambodian People's Party]] in an effort to portray his party as a democratic institution and renounce its revolutionary struggle.<ref>Corfield (a), p. 106</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 1991, the Cambodian factions of the Supreme National Council, along with Vietnam and 15 member nations of the International Peace Conference on Cambodia, signed the [[1991 Paris Peace Accords|Paris Peace Agreement]]. For the Cambodian people, two decades of continuous warfare and 13 years of civil war seemed to be over, although an atmosphere of uneasiness amongst the leaders of the Cambodian factions remained.<ref name=\"Spooner, p. 228\">Spooner, p. 228</ref> In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement, the major powers agreed to avoid using the word \"genocide\" to describe the actions of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the period between 1975 and 1979. As a result, Hun Sen criticised the Paris Agreement as being far from perfect, as it failed to remind the Cambodian people of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Spooner, p. 228\" /> Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement established the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC), in accordance with the UN Security Council's Resolution 745,<ref name=\"Deng & Wang, p. 77\">Deng & Wang, p. 77</ref> and gave UNTAC a broad mandate to supervise main policies and administration works until a Cambodian government was democratically elected.<ref>DeRouen & Heo, p. 232</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 1991, Sihanouk returned to Cambodia to participate in the elections, followed by Son Senn, a Khmer Rouge official, who arrived a few days later to set up the organisation's electoral campaign office in Phnom Penh.<ref name=\"Spooner, p. 228\" /> On 27 November 1991, Khieu Samphan also returned to Cambodia on a flight from [[Bangkok]]; initially he had expected his arrival to be uneventful, but as soon as Khieu Samphan's flight landed at [[Pochentong Airport]], he was met by an angry crowd which shouted insults and abuse at him. As Khieu Samphan was driven into the city, another crowd lined the route towards his office and threw objects at his car.<ref>Corfield, p. 108</ref> As soon as he arrived at his office, Khieu Samphan entered and immediately telephoned the Chinese Government to save him. Shortly afterwards, an angry mob forced its way into the building, chased Khieu Samphan up the second floor and tried to hang him from a ceiling fan. Eventually, Khieu Samphan was able to escape from the building by a ladder with his face bloodied, and was immediately taken to Pochentong Airport, where he flew out of Cambodia. With the departure of Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rouge's participation in the election seemed doubtful.<ref>Corfield, p. 109</ref>\n\nIn March 1992, the start of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which included troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers.<ref name=\"Deng & Wang, p. 77\" /> The mission was led by [[Yasushi Akashi]].<ref>Corfield, p. 110</ref> In June 1992, the Khmer Rouge formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, the Khmer Rouge also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement.<ref>Corfield, p. 111</ref> Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, the Khmer Rouge started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia.<ref>Corfield, p. 112</ref> Towards the end of 1992, Khmer Rouge forces advanced into [[Kampong Thom (city)|Kampong Thom]] in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there. In the months leading up to the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.<ref>Spooner, p. 229</ref>\n\nDespite ongoing threats from the Khmer Rouge during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 percent of the vote, against 38.23 percent for the Cambodian People's Party.<ref>Corfield (a), p. 114</ref> Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen refused to accept the results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, announced the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported the Cambodian People's Party. Prince [[Norodom Ranariddh]], leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party so the country would not break up. On 21 September 1993, the Cambodian Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister. He appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister.<ref>Corfield (a), p. 115</ref> On 23 September 1993, the [[constitutional monarchy]] was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state.<ref>Corfield, p. 115</ref> In July 1994, the Cambodian Government outlawed the Khmer Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, the Cambodian Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea.<ref>Hammer, p. 22</ref> By 1998, the Khmer Rouge was completely dissolved.<ref>Spooner, p. 236</ref>\n\n=== Vietnam rejoins the world ===\nThe military occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective on foreign policy had been dominated by the need to maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist.<ref name=\"Largo, p. 85\">Largo, p. 85</ref> Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with that view. However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 2</ref> In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations. Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of [[ASEAN]].<ref name=\"Largo, p. 85\" />\n\nIn light of the decline experienced by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, the Vietnamese Government began repairing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries as part of a greater effort to rejuvenate Vietnam's shattered economy. Since its invasion in 1979, China had placed sustained pressure on the northern borders of Vietnam, with the province of Ha Tuyen regularly shelled by Chinese artillery. In September 1985, Chinese bombardment of Ha Tuyen reached a peak when 2,000 rounds were fired.<ref>Thayer, p. 11</ref> To reduce the state of hostility along the border region, and ultimately normalise relations with China, the Vietnamese Government dropped all hostile references to China at the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986, and also adopted the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] policy.<ref>Frost, p. 32</ref> In August 1990, as the Cambodian Peace Plan, authored by Australian Foreign Minister [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], was being endorsed by the UN Security Council, both China and Vietnam moved towards accommodation.<ref name=\"Froster, p. 34\">Froster, p. 34</ref>\n\nEarly in September 1990, Vietnamese Prime Minister [[\u0110\u1ed7 M\u01b0\u1eddi]], general secretary Nguyen Van Linh and former Prime Minister Pham Van Dong travelled to [[Chengdu]], China, where they held a secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister [[Li Peng]] and General Secretary of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] [[Jiang Zemin]]. On 17 September 1990, General [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance.<ref name=\"Froster, p. 34\" /> Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n Ki\u1ec7t]] travelled to [[Beijing]] and met his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, and they issued an 11-point communiqu\u00e9 re-establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries after 10 years without formal relations.<ref>Froster, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe end of the Cambodian conflict also brought an end to the ASEAN-imposed trade and aid embargo which had been in place since 1979. In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister [[Chatichai Choonhavan]] publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, and the rest of [[Indochina]], to gain admission into ASEAN.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 3</ref> In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 4</ref> Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats in the post-[[Cold War]] era, when Soviet aid was no longer available.<ref>Thayer (a), p. 7</ref> Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994.<ref name=\"Thayer (a), p. 5\">Thayer (a), p. 5</ref> Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam's isolation from the United States.<ref name=\"Thayer (a), p. 5\" />\n\n=== Environmental impacts ===\nCambodia and Vietnam's forest cover underwent drastic reductions following the end of the Khmer Rouge regime.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\">Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13</ref> The fall of Khmer Rouge was attributed to Vietnamese troops overthrowing the government and the occupation of Phnom Penh, establishing the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) in 1978.<ref name=\"Vickery, p. 435-465\">Vickery, p. 435-465</ref> With lack of international support by the end of the Cold War, the Khmer Rouge struggled to rebuild itself.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> In an attempt to increase revenue and regain power, they established themselves along the Thailand-Cambodia border in northwestern Cambodia to focus on exploiting Cambodia's natural resources including timber and rubies.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> With 15% of total global tropical forests, Southeast Asia is a leader in timber production.<ref name=\"Stibig et al., p. 247\">Stibig et al., p. 247</ref> This initiative quickly became an race between political factions, as the PRK adopted Khmer Rouge extraction efforts.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" />\n\nFrom 1969 to 1995, Cambodia's forest cover shrank from 73% to 30\u201335%.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> Similarly, Vietnam lost nearly three million hectares of forest cover from 1976 to 1995.<ref name=\"McElwee, p. 97-135\">McElwee, p. 97-135</ref> In 1992, Khmer Rouge became internationally isolated.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> The United Nations Security Council banned all exports of Cambodian timber in November of that year.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\">Salo, p. 127</ref> Efforts to create a neutral electoral environment led to the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTAC) in Cambodia.<ref name=\"Billon, p. 563-586\">Billon, p. 563-586</ref> The move was implemented in January 1993.<ref name=\"Wolf, p. 429\">Wolf, p. 429</ref> In the same year, the Vietnamese issued a logging ban, driving the Khmer Rouge to logging illegally.<ref name=\"McElwee, p. 97-135\" /> Illicit exports from Cambodia to Vietnam was worth US$130&nbsp;million each year.<ref name=\"McElwee, p. 97-135\" />\n\nThailand was the largest violator of UNTAC.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\" /> The Thai government at the time insisted that Cambodian imported timber must have a certificate of origin approved by the governmental authorities in Phnom Penh.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> These certificates cost US$35 for each cubic metre of timber from Khmer Rouge operating areas.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> This forced the Khmer Rouge  to increase prices. They learned to speak Thai and sold timber illegally to Thai timber operators, earning them over US$10&nbsp;million monthly.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\" /> [[Global Witness]], an international human rights and environmental [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) based in London,<ref name=\"Bannon & Collier, p. xv\">Bannon & Collier, p. xv</ref> recognized these timber guerillas when they identified mass Cambodian exports.<ref name=\"Salo, p. 127\" /> They subsequently lobbied for an amendment to the US Foreign Operations Act.<ref name=\"Matthew, Brown & Jensen, p. 13\" /> The act was passed.

The company operates distribution centers in [[Rwanda]] and [[Ghana]]. The company began drone deliveries in Rwanda in 2016 and primarily delivers blood. In addition to [[whole blood]], the drones deliver [[platelet]]s, frozen [[Plasmapheresis|plasma]] and [[Cryoprecipitate reduced plasma|cryoprecipitate]]. As of May 2019, more than 65% of blood deliveries in Rwanda outside of [[Kigali]] use Zipline drones. In Ghana, the company began using drones in April 2019 to deliver vaccines, blood and medicines.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe company was founded in 2011 as Romotive by Keller Rinaudo. Romotive produced an iPhone-controlled robotic toy called Romo. In 2014 Romotive shut down{{R|ShutDown}}{{R|ShutDown2}}{{R|crunch}} and the company refocused on delivering medical supplies using drones. Co-founders Keenan Wyrobek and William Hetzler joined at this time.{{R|mit}} In 2016, the company signed a deal with the Rwandan government to build a distribution center near [[Muhanga, Rukiga|Muhanga]].{{R|mit}} In April 2018, Zipline announced a second generation drone.{{R| mit2}} This second-generation drone was listed in ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'''s \"Best inventions of 2018\" list.{{R|best}} In April 2019, Zipline opened its first of four distribution centers in Ghana to supply 2,500 health facilities.{{R|CNBC Ghana}} In May 2019, Zipline raised $190 million on a post money valuation of $1.2 billion.{{R|billion}} In September 2019, musician [[Bono]] joined the board.{{R|bono}} \"Rural healthcare is a challenge in every country in the world including in the United States\" said Rinaudo. \"You now see much bigger and wealthier countries like the U.S. actually using Rwanda as a role model.\"{{R|wiredus}} Zipline was named to [[CNBC]]'s 2018 Disruptor 50 list.{{R|drive}}\n\n==Drone==\n\nThe company's drones are designed and built in-house.{{R|in house}} Their drones can deliver medical supplies to anywhere within {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} of a Zipline distribution center in under 45 minutes.{{R|Spectrum}} The drone cruises at a speed of {{convert|101|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|400-500|m}}. The \u201cRobin\u201d model has an {{convert|80| km|abbr=on}} range while the newer \u201cSparrow\u201d has a range of {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}}<ref name=\":1\" /> and carries up to {{convert|1.75|kg}} of cargo.{{R|Spectrum}} Each hub is able to make 500 deliveries per day.{{R|:2}} Zipline holds the record for the longest-range US based commercial drone delivery flight of {{convert|79|mile|abbr=on}}{{R|mile}} The drone has dual propellers for reliability, and can fly safely with only one operating propeller or motor. The drone also features a quickly replaced streamlined battery for rapid turnaround between flights.{{R|WiredHow}} It has an inner frame constructed out of carbon-fiber and an outer shell made of polystyrene.{{R|WiredHow}} The wing span has a length of {{convert|12|feet|m|abbr=}}.{{R|WiredHow}} It is launched into flight with an electric launcher, with an acceleration from {{convert|0 to 70|mph}} in 0.33 seconds.{{R|WiredHow}}\n\n==Operations==\nMedical staff at remote clinics send orders via SMS, [[WhatsApp]] message, or a dedicated online portal and a confirmation message is returned. {{R|quartz}} Flight paths are predetermined and programmed using information from a 3D satellite map and manual ground surveys. {{R|mit}} A controller at the base monitors all drones in flight. {{R|Simmons}} In addition to [[whole blood]], the drones deliver [[platelet]]s, fresh frozen [[Plasmapheresis|plasma]] and [[Cryoprecipitate reduced plasma|cryoprecipitate]].{{R|enables}} The location data is also sent to the country's main air traffic control system. {{R|Simmons}} The drone is launched by a [[supercapacitor]]-powered electric [[assisted take-off|catapult]] and returns by catching an [[arresting gear]]{{R|drops}} {{R|Spectrum}} with a system to [[Real-time kinematic|enhance GPS accuracy]].{{R|gps}} The drone does not land at the delivery site but drops the package with a parachute. A payload can land within a {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} diameter landing zone. {{R|mit}} The cost per delivery is the same as previous motorcycle service but more reliable.{{R|ryan}} Overall costs are reduced by supply chain optimization and waste minimization. {{R|mit}}\n\n==Prominent shareholders==\n\nAs of May 2019, Zipline has raised $225 million since it was founded.{{R|190 r}}\n\n* [[Paul Allen]]{{R|yang}}\n* [[Andreessen Horowitz]]{{R|cnbcMAY2018}}\n* [[Baillie Gifford]]{{R|190 r}}\n* Bright Success Capital{{R|190 r}}\n*[[Design to Improve Life]] Fund{{R|billion}}{{R|design}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance]]{{R|hbr}}{{r|robotics}}\n* [[Goldman Sachs]]{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Google Ventures]]{{R|cnbcMAY2018}} {{R|190 r}}\n* Katalyst Ventures{{R|:0}}{{R|Kat}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Alfred Lin]]{{R|yang}}\n* Oakhouse Partners{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Jeffrey Skoll|The Rise Fund]]{{R|rise}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Ron Conway]]{{R|:0}}\n* [[Sequoia Capital]]{{R|cnbcMAY2018}} {{R|yang}}\n* [[Stanford University]]{{R|cnbcAPR2018}}{{R|cnbcMAY2018}}\n* Subtraction Capital{{R|:0}}\n* [[Temasek Holdings]]{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Toyota Tsusho]] was the first business company investment.{{R|toyota}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[United Parcel Service]]{{r|robotics}}\n* [[Jerry Yang]]{{R|yang}}\n\n==Locations==\n\n=== Ghana ===\nIn April 2019, Ghana's president, [[Nana Akufo-Addo]], announced the opening of a distribution center.{{R|Ghana}} Vice President Mahamuda Bawumia launched the first Zipline drone to Tafo Hospital in Ghana on April 24, 2019.

This is largely due to the poor infrastructure conditions in Rwanda even though Rwanda is densely populated with a small landmass.{{R|hbr}} On December 21 2016, two year old Ghislane Ihimbazwe, was saved after she received an emergency delivery of two units of blood by a Zipline drone and is probably the first life saved. A second drone launching site was added in December 2018 in [[Kayonza]], in the eastern part of the country.{{R|Kayonza}}{{R|CNBC Ghana}} The company hoped this would bring coverage to 80% of the country. {{R| modern ghana}} Kayonza is in a busy area with other flights and military camps which adds to the challenge of monitoring its drones.{{R|Kayonza}} As of September 2019, the company had made 20,000 blood deliveries and flown more than {{convert|1,000,000|km|abbr=on}}.{{R|CNBC Ghana}} As of May 2019, more than 65% of blood deliveries in Rwanda outside of the capital city [[Kigali]] use Zipline drones. {{R|robotics}}\n===United States===\n\nZipline is working with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to develop rules for the operation of drones beyond the line of sight.{{R|wiredus}}{{R|USA}} Zipline is establishing a site in [[Reno, Nevada]] to service seven hospitals to help with medical logistics in rural areas.{{R|Fastcompany}}\n\nBetween July 30th and September 5th, 2019, Zipline partnered with the US and Australian militaries, delivering over 400 mock blood supplies during mass casualty simulations.{{R|army}}\n\n<br />\n\n==Distribution center locations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Distribution Centers\n!

The company operates distribution centers in [[Rwanda]] and [[Ghana]]. The company began drone deliveries in Rwanda in 2016 and primarily delivers blood. In addition to [[whole blood]], the drones deliver [[platelet]]s, frozen [[Plasmapheresis|plasma]] and [[Cryoprecipitate reduced plasma|cryoprecipitate]]. As of May 2019, more than 65% of blood deliveries in Rwanda outside of [[Kigali]] use Zipline drones. In Ghana, the company began using drones in April 2019 to deliver vaccines, blood and medicines.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe company was founded in 2011 as Romotive by Keller Rinaudo. Romotive produced an iPhone-controlled robotic toy called Romo. In 2014 Romotive shut down{{R|ShutDown}}{{R|ShutDown2}}{{R|crunch}} and the company refocused on delivering medical supplies using drones. Co-founders Keenan Wyrobek and William Hetzler joined at this time.{{R|mit}} In 2016, the company signed a deal with the Rwandan government to build a distribution center near [[Muhanga, Rukiga|Muhanga]].{{R|mit}} In April 2018, Zipline announced a second generation drone.{{R| mit2}} This second-generation drone was listed in ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'''s \"Best inventions of 2018\" list.{{R|best}} In April 2019, Zipline opened its first of four distribution centers in Ghana to supply 2,500 health facilities.{{R|CNBC Ghana}} In May 2019, Zipline raised $190 million on a post money valuation of $1.2 billion.{{R|billion}} In September 2019, musician [[Bono]] joined the board.{{R|bono}} \"Rural healthcare is a challenge in every country in the world including in the United States\" said Rinaudo. \"You now see much bigger and wealthier countries like the U.S. actually using Rwanda as a role model.\"{{R|wiredus}} Zipline was named to [[CNBC]]'s 2018 Disruptor 50 list.{{R|drive}}\n\n==Drone==\n\nThe company's drones are designed and built in-house.{{R|in house}} Their drones can deliver medical supplies to anywhere within {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} of a Zipline distribution center in under 45 minutes.{{R|Spectrum}} The drone cruises at a speed of {{convert|101|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|400-500|m}}. The \u201cRobin\u201d model has an {{convert|80| km|abbr=on}} range while the newer \u201cSparrow\u201d has a range of {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}}<ref name=\":1\" /> and carries up to {{convert|1.75|kg}} of cargo.{{R|Spectrum}} Each hub is able to make 500 deliveries per day.{{R|:2}} Zipline holds the record for the longest-range US based commercial drone delivery flight of {{convert|79|mile|abbr=on}}{{R|mile}} The drone has dual propellers for reliability, and can fly safely with only one operating propeller or motor. The drone also features a quickly replaced streamlined battery for rapid turnaround between flights.{{R|WiredHow}} It has an inner frame constructed out of carbon-fiber and an outer shell made of polystyrene.{{R|WiredHow}} The wing span has a length of {{convert|12|feet|m|abbr=}}.{{R|WiredHow}} It is launched into flight with an electric launcher, with an acceleration from {{convert|0 to 70|mph}} in 0.33 seconds.{{R|WiredHow}}\n\n==Operations==\nMedical staff at remote clinics send orders via SMS, [[WhatsApp]] message, or a dedicated online portal and a confirmation message is returned. {{R|quartz}} Flight paths are predetermined and programmed using information from a 3D satellite map and manual ground surveys. {{R|mit}} A controller at the base monitors all drones in flight. {{R|Simmons}} In addition to [[whole blood]], the drones deliver [[platelet]]s, fresh frozen [[Plasmapheresis|plasma]] and [[Cryoprecipitate reduced plasma|cryoprecipitate]].{{R|enables}} The location data is also sent to the country's main air traffic control system. {{R|Simmons}} The drone is launched by a [[supercapacitor]]-powered electric [[assisted take-off|catapult]] and returns by catching an [[arresting gear]]{{R|drops}} {{R|Spectrum}} with a system to [[Real-time kinematic|enhance GPS accuracy]].{{R|gps}} The drone does not land at the delivery site but drops the package with a parachute. A payload can land within a {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} diameter landing zone. {{R|mit}} The cost per delivery is the same as previous motorcycle service but more reliable.{{R|ryan}} Overall costs are reduced by supply chain optimization and waste minimization. {{R|mit}}\n\n==Prominent shareholders==\n\nAs of May 2019, Zipline has raised $225 million since it was founded.{{R|190 r}}\n\n* [[Paul Allen]]{{R|yang}}\n* [[Andreessen Horowitz]]{{R|cnbcMAY2018}}\n* [[Baillie Gifford]]{{R|190 r}}\n* Bright Success Capital{{R|190 r}}\n*[[Design to Improve Life]] Fund{{R|billion}}{{R|design}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance]]{{R|hbr}}{{r|robotics}}\n* [[Goldman Sachs]]{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Google Ventures]]{{R|cnbcMAY2018}} {{R|190 r}}\n* Katalyst Ventures{{R|:0}}{{R|Kat}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Alfred Lin]]{{R|yang}}\n* Oakhouse Partners{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Jeffrey Skoll|The Rise Fund]]{{R|rise}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Ron Conway]]{{R|:0}}\n* [[Sequoia Capital]]{{R|cnbcMAY2018}} {{R|yang}}\n* [[Stanford University]]{{R|cnbcAPR2018}}{{R|cnbcMAY2018}}\n* Subtraction Capital{{R|:0}}\n* [[Temasek Holdings]]{{R|190 r}}\n* [[Toyota Tsusho]] was the first business company investment.{{R|toyota}}{{R|190 r}}\n* [[United Parcel Service]]{{r|robotics}}\n* [[Jerry Yang]]{{R|yang}}\n\n==Locations==\n\n=== Ghana ===\nIn April 2019, Ghana's president, [[Nana Akufo-Addo]], announced the opening of a distribution center.{{R|Ghana}} Vice President Mahamuda Bawumia launched the first Zipline drone to Tafo Hospital in Ghana on April 24, 2019. This first delivery contained [[yellow fever]] vaccines to prevent stock-out.{{R| Quartz Ghana}} The drones will cover 500 health facilities within an {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} range. {{R|Quartz Ghana}} The company has a contract with Ghana to make 600 deliveries a day for four years at a cost of about $12.5 million.{{R|Quartz Ghana}} Each distribution center will house 30 drones.{{R| Spectrum Ghana}}{{R| ReutersVaccines}} It operates three distribution centers in Ghana with another one planned in early 2020.{{R| ghanaweb}}\n\nIn June 2019, Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) was delivered by Zipline to treat 113 students of Mangoase Senior High School suffering from acute diarrhoea.

Zipline will start operations in early 2020 building to 10 distribution centers to cover 120 million citizens.{{R|india}}\n\n=== Philippines ===\n\nIn December 2019, Bono announced that in Summer 2020 three distribution centers will be opened up in the [[Visayas]], [[Philippines]] to cover hard-to-reach areas. {{R|manila}}\n\n=== Rwanda ===\nThe company operates two distribution centers in Rwanda {{R|:2}}{{R|Spectrum}} and began deliveries in Muhanga in late 2016.{{R|mit}} Rwanda has a mountainous geography and poor road conditions making an aerial delivery system more efficient.{{R| disrupter}} The cost of delivery via drone is reported to be comparable to conventional means by road especially in the cases of emergencies. This is largely due to the poor infrastructure conditions in Rwanda even though Rwanda is densely populated with a small landmass.{{R|hbr}} On December 21 2016, two year old Ghislane Ihimbazwe, was saved after she received an emergency delivery of two units of blood by a Zipline drone and is probably the first life saved. A second drone launching site was added in December 2018 in [[Kayonza]], in the eastern part of the country.{{R|Kayonza}}{{R|CNBC Ghana}} The company hoped this would bring coverage to 80% of the country. {{R| modern ghana}} Kayonza is in a busy area with other flights and military camps which adds to the challenge of monitoring its drones.{{R|Kayonza}} As of September 2019, the company had made 20,000 blood deliveries and flown more than {{convert|1,000,000|km|abbr=on}}.{{R|CNBC Ghana}} As of May 2019, more than 65% of blood deliveries in Rwanda outside of the capital city [[Kigali]] use Zipline drones. {{R|robotics}}\n===United States===\n\nZipline is working with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to develop rules for the operation of drones beyond the line of sight.{{R|wiredus}}{{R|USA}} Zipline is establishing a site in [[Reno, Nevada]] to service seven hospitals to help with medical logistics in rural areas.{{R|Fastcompany}}\n\nBetween July 30th and September 5th, 2019, Zipline partnered with the US and Australian militaries, delivering over 400 mock blood supplies during mass casualty simulations.{{R|army}}\n\n<br />\n\n==Distribution Center locations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Distribution Centers\n!
