The station is owned by Roberts Media, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]; the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], which owns [[CBS]] affiliate [[KVAL-TV]] (channel 13), operates KMTR under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA). The two stations share studios and transmitter facilities on Blanton Road in Eugene. KMTR maintained separate facilities on International Court in [[Springfield, Oregon]], until 2020 when the station relocated to KVAL's building; [[master control]] and some internal operations for KMTR were based at the KVAL studios.\n\nKMTR reaches additional viewers in central and western Oregon via co-owned full-powered [[broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite stations]] '''KMCB''' in [[Coos Bay, Oregon|Coos Bay]] (virtual channel 23, UHF digital channel 22) and '''KTCW''' in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] (virtual channel 46, UHF digital channel 45).\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting on October 4, 1982, after former NBC affiliate [[KVAL-TV]] began selectively omitting certain NBC prime time broadcasts from its evening lineup, replacing them with alternate programming from rival network, [[CBS]]. The resulting conflict over this programming decision preceded the introduction of KMTR to the media market, and a switch of KVAL's affiliation from NBC to CBS. The Columbia Empire Broadcasting Corporation of [[Yakima, Washington]] acquired the station in 1984. \n\nIn late 1995, the station was bought by the Wicks Broadcast Group of [[New York City]]. In March 1996, Wicks Broadcast Group named Brian Benschoter the station's new GM; he started shaking things up immediately for the third-place Eugene-based station. On May 21, 1996, he abruptly fired longtime sports anchors Brian Lamb and Steve Freedman without warning. Lamb, an 11\u00bd year veteran of the station, and Freedman, an 8\u00bd year employee, introduced the \"Prep Athlete of the Week\" segment that became an immensely popular weekly honor. The award is still considered by locals as the top media honor one can receive for high school sports in the Eugene/Springfield area.{{citation needed|reason=\"Top\" could be seen as mere hyperbole, without a reference to back it up|date=October 2015}} Lamb and Freedman were replaced by Joe Giansante, a sports talk radio host on [[KUGN]] AM 590.\n\nIn September 1998, an agreement between KMTR, [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] and the area's cable provider allowed the station to launch cable-only [[The WB|WB]] affiliate \"KZWB\". Since it was a cable-exclusive outlet, the call sign was not officially recognized by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).

KMTR was named \"Station of the Year\" for 2005 by the Oregon Association of Broadcasters (OAB).\n\nIn February 2006, the two satellite stations, KMTZ and KMTX, changed their call letters to KUCW and KTCW, respectively.

The station is owned by Roberts Media, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]; the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], which owns [[CBS]] affiliate [[KVAL-TV]] (channel 13), operates KMTR under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA). The two stations share studios and transmitter facilities on Blanton Road in Eugene. KMTR maintained separate facilities on International Court in [[Springfield, Oregon]], until 2020 when the station relocated to KVAL's building; [[master control]] and some internal operations for KMTR were based at the KVAL studios.\n\nKMTR reaches additional viewers in central and western Oregon via co-owned full-powered [[broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite stations]] '''KMCB''' in [[Coos Bay, Oregon|Coos Bay]] (virtual channel 23, UHF digital channel 22) and '''KTCW''' in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] (virtual channel 46, UHF digital channel 45).\n\n==History==\nThe station began broadcasting on October 4, 1982, after former NBC affiliate [[KVAL-TV]] began selectively omitting certain NBC prime time broadcasts from its evening lineup, replacing them with alternate programming from rival network, [[CBS]]. The resulting conflict over this programming decision preceded the introduction of KMTR to the media market, and a switch of KVAL's affiliation from NBC to CBS. The Columbia Empire Broadcasting Corporation of [[Yakima, Washington]] acquired the station in 1984. \n\nIn late 1995, the station was bought by the Wicks Broadcast Group of [[New York City]]. In March 1996, Wicks Broadcast Group named Brian Benschoter the station's new GM; he started shaking things up immediately for the third-place Eugene-based station. On May 21, 1996, he abruptly fired longtime sports anchors Brian Lamb and Steve Freedman without warning. Lamb, an 11\u00bd year veteran of the station, and Freedman, an 8\u00bd year employee, introduced the \"Prep Athlete of the Week\" segment that became an immensely popular weekly honor. The award is still considered by locals as the top media honor one can receive for high school sports in the Eugene/Springfield area.{{citation needed|reason=\"Top\" could be seen as mere hyperbole, without a reference to back it up|date=October 2015}} Lamb and Freedman were replaced by Joe Giansante, a sports talk radio host on [[KUGN]] AM 590.\n\nIn September 1998, an agreement between KMTR, [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] and the area's cable provider allowed the station to launch cable-only [[The WB|WB]] affiliate \"KZWB\". Since it was a cable-exclusive outlet, the call sign was not officially recognized by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). KMTR provided sales and promotional opportunities to the cable channel.<ref name=tvwk>{{cite journal|last1=O'Steen|first1=Kathleen|title=The WB's Radical Genesis|journal=Television Week|date=September 22, 2003|page=14|url=https://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2003/09/the-wbs-radical-genesis/|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=WB 100+ Affiliates|journal=Television Week |date=September 22, 2003 |page=18 |url= https://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2003/09/wb-100-affiliates/ |accessdate= July 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Steen|first1=Kathleen|title=Forging an Identity|journal=Television Week|date=September 22, 2003|page=20|url=https://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2003/09/forging-an-identity/|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1999, Wicks sold KMTR to the [[Ackerley Group]], who merged with Clear Channel Communications (now [[iHeartMedia]]) in 2001.

He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of the old countess was inspired by Princess [[Natalya Golitsyna|Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna]], who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=umQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT623&dq=the+queen+of+spades+pushkin+avarice#v=onepage |title=Delphi Collected Works of Alexander Pushkin (Illustrated) |last=Pushkin |first=Alexander |date=2013-11-17 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=9781908909688 |language=en}}</ref> According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler.

Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text.

These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Storytelling ===\nPushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pushkiniana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200:clayton-articles1213&catid=133&Itemid=256|title=\"The Queen of Spades\": A Seriously Intended Joke / \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a|last=Douglas|first=Clayton, J.|website=The Pushkin Review|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> \n\nA reading of ''The Queen of Spades'' holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold Fusion: Aspects of the German Cultural Presence in Russia|last=Barabtarlo|first=Gennady|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2000|isbn=1571811885|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Avarice ===\nRosenshield describes Pushkin\u2019s Queen of Spades as an \u201ceternal tale of gambling and avarice.\u201d<ref>Gregg, Richard. \u201cGermann the Confessor and the Stony, Seated Countess: The Moral Subtext of Pushkin's 'the Queen of Spades'\u201d.

These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form.

It has been filmed numerous times.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Obukhov Hospital.jpg|thumb|Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion]]\nHermann, an [[German diaspora|ethnic German]], is an officer of the [[military engineer|engineers]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary.

These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of ''The Queen of Spades''.<ref name=\":1\" /> A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Adaptations ==\nOne of the most notable adaptations of The Queen of Spades was a film produced by [[Anatole de Grunwald]] completed in 1949. This film is recognized for its fidelity to the original story with few differences such as the depiction of the backstory about how the Countess acquired the secret of the three winning cards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Classic Horror Films and the Literature That Inspired Them|last=Backer|first=Ron|publisher=McFarland|year=2015|isbn=9780786498963|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=40}}</ref> This film was directed by [[Thorold Dickinson]] and it received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the BAFTA award for Best British Film.\n\nPushkin's story has been adapted numerous times into multiple mediums.
