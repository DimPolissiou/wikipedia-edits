They finished the season 34-4 overall, won the ACC regular season title with a 14-2 record and won the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993 national championship]]. They were coached by [[Dean Smith]], who won his second national championship in his thirty-second season as head coach of the Tar Heels. They played their home games at the [[Dean Smith Center]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].\n\n==Season summary==\n\nThe 1992-93 team was led by [[George Lynch (basketball)|George Lynch]], [[Eric Montross]], [[Brian Reese]], [[Donald Williams (basketball)|Donald Williams]], and [[Derrick Phelps]]. The Tar Heels started out with an 8-0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 [[1992\u201393 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] in their sophomore season, won 79-78 to on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]] and #5 [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into the last week of the regular season (their first #1 ranking since the start of the 1987-88 season).  North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], defeating #16-seed [[East Carolina Pirates men's basketball|East Carolina]] (85-65), #8-seed [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|Rhode Island]] (112-67), #4-seed [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] (80-74), and #2-seed [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (75-68) to reach the final four in [[New Orleans]].\n\nIn the national semi-finals, Smith's Tar Heels defeated his alma mater [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] (coached by future North Carolina coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]) 78-68, setting up a rematch with #3-ranked [[1992\u201393 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] in the finals.\n\nThe national title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for [[Chris Webber]]'s time out call with seconds left when Michigan didn't have any. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship.<ref name=\"1993champ\">{{cite news|url=http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033003aaa.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117134154/http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033003aaa.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-11-17 |publisher=Tar Heel Monthly |title=THM: Looking Back At 1993 |author=Adam Lucas |accessdate=2007-08-08 |date=2003-03-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

They finished the season 34-4 overall, won the ACC regular season title with a 14-2 record and won the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993 national championship]]. They were coached by [[Dean Smith]], who won his second national championship in his thirty-second season as head coach of the Tar Heels. They played their home games at the [[Dean Smith Center]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].\n\n==Season summary==\n\nThe 1992-93 team was led by [[George Lynch (basketball)|George Lynch]], [[Eric Montross]], [[Brian Reese]], [[Donald Williams (basketball)|Donald Williams]], and [[Derrick Phelps]]. The Tar Heels started out with an 8-0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 [[1992\u201393 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] in their sophomore season, won 79-78 to on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]] and #5 [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into the last week of the regular season (their first #1 ranking since the start of the 1987-88 season).  North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], defeating #16-seed [[East Carolina Pirates men's basketball|East Carolina]] (85-65), #8-seed [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|Rhode Island]] (112-67), #4-seed [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] (80-74) and #2-seed [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (75-68) to reach the final four in [[New Orleans]].\n\nIn the national semi-finals, Smith's Tar Heels defeated his alma mater [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] (coached by future North Carolina coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]) 78-68, setting up a rematch with #3-ranked [[1992\u201393 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] in the finals.\n\nThe national title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for [[Chris Webber]]'s time out call with seconds left when Michigan didn't have any. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship.<ref name=\"1993champ\">{{cite news|url=http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033003aaa.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117134154/http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033003aaa.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-11-17 |publisher=Tar Heel Monthly |title=THM: Looking Back At 1993 |author=Adam Lucas |accessdate=2007-08-08 |date=2003-03-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

HIV sequences obtained from these two patients using modern sequencing technologies showed that HIV genes were inactivated by replacement of tryptophan codons by stop codons, which is probably due to the action of a cellular enzyme, APOBEC. This work is a paradigm shift in HIV research that considered eradication of any HIV DNA from patients cells as a necessary step towards a possible cure. It provides opportunities for assessment of the chances for patients of a spontaneously favorable course of HIV infection, and for treatment through the use of APOBEC.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-0691.12807 |pmid=25366539 |pmc=4360783 |title=HIV infection en route to endogenization: Two cases |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1280\u20138 |year=2014 |last1=Colson |first1=P |last2=Ravaux |first2=I |last3=Tamalet |first3=C |last4=Glazunova |first4=O |last5=Baptiste |first5=E |last6=Chabriere |first6=E |last7=Wiedemann |first7=A |last8=Lacabaratz |first8=C |last9=Chefrour |first9=M |last10=Picard |first10=C |last11=Stein |first11=A |last12=Levy |first12=Y |last13=Raoult |first13=D }}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n=== Ban from publishing in the American Society for Microbiology journals ===\nIn 2006, Raoult and four co-authors were banned for one year from publishing in the journals of the [[American Society for Microbiology]], after a reviewer for ''[[Infection and Immunity]]'' discovered that two images in a figure from the revised manuscript of a paper about mouse modelling for [[typhus]] were identical to figures from the originally submitted manuscript, even though they were supposed to represent a different experiment.

HIV sequences obtained from these two patients using modern sequencing technologies showed that HIV genes were inactivated by replacement of tryptophan codons by stop codons, which is probably due to the action of a cellular enzyme, APOBEC.
