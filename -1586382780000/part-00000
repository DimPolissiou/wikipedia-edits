The interactions between bacteria, cancer cells, and the surrounding microenvironment cause various alterations in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines, which further facilitate tumor regression. \u2460 Bacterial toxins from S. Typhimurium, Listeria, and Clostridium can kill tumor cells directly by inducing apoptosis or autophagy. Toxins delivered via Salmonella can upregulate Connexin 43 (Cx43), leading to bacteria-induced gap junctions between the tumor and dendritic cells (DCs), which allow cross-presentation of tumor antigens to the DCs. \u2461 Upon exposure to tumor antigens and interaction with bacterial components, DCs secrete robust amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, which subsequently activates CD8+ T cells. \u2462 The antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells is further enhanced by bacterial flagellin (a protein subunit of the bacterial flagellum) via TLR5 activation. The perforin and granzyme proteins secreted by activated CD8+ T cells efficiently kill tumor cells in primary and metastatic tumors. \u2463 Flagellin and TLR5 signaling also decreases the abundance of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which subsequently improves the antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells. \u2464 S. Typhimurium flagellin stimulates NK cells to produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), an important cytokine for both innate and adaptive immunity. \u2465 Listeria-infected MDSCs shift into an immune-stimulating phenotype characterized by increased IL-12 production, which further enhances the CD8+ T and NK cell responses. \u2466 Both S. Typhimurium and Clostridium infection can stimulate significant neutrophil accumulation. Elevated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by neutrophils enhances the immune response and kills tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. \u2467 The macrophage inflammasome is activated through contact with bacterial components (LPS and flagellin) and Salmonella-damaged cancer cells, leading to elevated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 into the tumor microenvironment.

NK cell: natural killer cell. Treg cell: regulatory T cell. MDSCs: myeloid-derived suppressor cells. P2X7 receptor: purinoceptor 7-extracellular ATP receptor.

The interactions between bacteria, cancer cells, and the surrounding microenvironment cause various alterations in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines, which further facilitate tumor regression. \u2460 Bacterial toxins from S. Typhimurium, Listeria, and Clostridium can kill tumor cells directly by inducing apoptosis or autophagy. Toxins delivered via Salmonella can upregulate Connexin 43 (Cx43), leading to bacteria-induced gap junctions between the tumor and dendritic cells (DCs), which allow cross-presentation of tumor antigens to the DCs. \u2461 Upon exposure to tumor antigens and interaction with bacterial components, DCs secrete robust amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, which subsequently activates CD8+ T cells. \u2462 The antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells is further enhanced by bacterial flagellin (a protein subunit of the bacterial flagellum) via TLR5 activation. The perforin and granzyme proteins secreted by activated CD8+ T cells efficiently kill tumor cells in primary and metastatic tumors. \u2463 Flagellin and TLR5 signaling also decreases the abundance of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which subsequently improves the antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells. \u2464 S. Typhimurium flagellin stimulates NK cells to produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), an important cytokine for both innate and adaptive immunity. \u2465 Listeria-infected MDSCs shift into an immune-stimulating phenotype characterized by increased IL-12 production, which further enhances the CD8+ T and NK cell responses. \u2466 Both S. Typhimurium and Clostridium infection can stimulate significant neutrophil accumulation. Elevated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by neutrophils enhances the immune response and kills tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. \u2467 The macrophage inflammasome is activated through contact with bacterial components (LPS and flagellin) and Salmonella-damaged cancer cells, leading to elevated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 into the tumor microenvironment. NK cell: natural killer cell. Treg cell: regulatory T cell. MDSCs: myeloid-derived suppressor cells. P2X7 receptor: purinoceptor 7-extracellular ATP receptor.

In particular, [[tumor-homing bacteria]] that thrive in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] environments are particularly attractive for this purpose, as they will tend to migrate to, invade (through the [[Tumor-associated endothelial cell#Abnormal function|leaky vasculature]] in the [[tumor microenvironment]]) and [[Colonisation (biology)|colonize]] tumors.

The interactions between bacteria, cancer cells, and the surrounding microenvironment cause various alterations in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines, which further facilitate tumor regression. \u2460 Bacterial toxins from S. Typhimurium, Listeria, and Clostridium can kill tumor cells directly by inducing apoptosis or autophagy. Toxins delivered via Salmonella can upregulate Connexin 43 (Cx43), leading to bacteria-induced gap junctions between the tumor and dendritic cells (DCs), which allow cross-presentation of tumor antigens to the DCs. \u2461 Upon exposure to tumor antigens and interaction with bacterial components, DCs secrete robust amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, which subsequently activates CD8+ T cells. \u2462 The antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells is further enhanced by bacterial flagellin (a protein subunit of the bacterial flagellum) via TLR5 activation. The perforin and granzyme proteins secreted by activated CD8+ T cells efficiently kill tumor cells in primary and metastatic tumors. \u2463 Flagellin and TLR5 signaling also decreases the abundance of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which subsequently improves the antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells. \u2464 S. Typhimurium flagellin stimulates NK cells to produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), an important cytokine for both innate and adaptive immunity. \u2465 Listeria-infected MDSCs shift into an immune-stimulating phenotype characterized by increased IL-12 production, which further enhances the CD8+ T and NK cell responses. \u2466 Both S. Typhimurium and Clostridium infection can stimulate significant neutrophil accumulation. Elevated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by neutrophils enhances the immune response and kills tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. \u2467 The macrophage inflammasome is activated through contact with bacterial components (LPS and flagellin) and Salmonella-damaged cancer cells, leading to elevated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 into the tumor microenvironment. NK cell: natural killer cell. Treg cell: regulatory T cell. MDSCs: myeloid-derived suppressor cells. P2X7 receptor: purinoceptor 7-extracellular ATP receptor. LPS: lipopolysaccharide]]\n[[File:Bacteria involved in causing and treating cancers.svg|thumb|Bacteria involved in causing and treating cancers]]\n\nThere is tremendous interest in using bacteria as a therapy to treat tumors. In particular, [[tumor-homing bacteria]] that thrive in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] environments are particularly attractive for this purpose, as they will tend to migrate to, invade (through the [[Tumor-associated endothelial cell#Abnormal function|leaky vasculature]] in the [[tumor microenvironment]]) and [[Colonisation (biology)|colonize]] tumors. This property tends to increase their residence time in the tumor, giving them longer to exert their therapeutic effects, in contrast to other bacteria that would be quickly cleared by the immune system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duong|first=Mai Thi-Quynh|last2=Qin|first2=Yeshan|last3=You|first3=Sung-Hwan|last4=Min|first4=Jung-Joon|date=2019-12-11|title=Bacteria-cancer interactions: bacteria-based cancer therapy|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-019-0297-0|journal=Experimental & Molecular Medicine|language=en|volume=51|issue=12|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.1038/s12276-019-0297-0|issn=2092-6413|pmc=PMC6906302|pmid=31827064}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sedighi|first=Mansour|last2=Zahedi Bialvaei|first2=Abed|last3=Hamblin|first3=Michael R.|last4=Ohadi|first4=Elnaz|last5=Asadi|first5=Arezoo|last6=Halajzadeh|first6=Masoumeh|last7=Lohrasbi|first7=Vahid|last8=Mohammadzadeh|first8=Nima|last9=Amiriani|first9=Taghi|last10=Krutova|first10=Marcela|last11=Amini|first11=Abolfazl|date=2019-04-05|title=Therapeutic bacteria to combat cancer; current advances, challenges, and opportunities|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cam4.2148|journal=Cancer Medicine|language=en|pages=cam4.2148|doi=10.1002/cam4.2148|issn=2045-7634|pmc=PMC6558487|pmid=30950210}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Shiyu|last2=Vuai|first2=Miza S.|last3=Zhong|first3=Mintao|date=2018-03-15|title=The role of bacteria in cancer therapy \u2013 enemies in the past, but allies at present|url=https://infectagentscancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13027-018-0180-y|journal=Infectious Agents and Cancer|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1186/s13027-018-0180-y|issn=1750-9378|pmc=PMC5856380|pmid=29568324}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Bacteria and humans]]\n[[Category:Biological engineering]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology products]]\n[[Category:Biopharmaceuticals]]\n[[Category:Pharmaceutical industry]]\n[[Category:Life sciences industry]]\n[[Category:Specialty drugs]]\n[[Category:Pharmacy]]\n\n\n{{Biotech-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings, removed stub tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_medicine"}

These aircraft will be transferred from other [[United Express]] carriers to GoJet.

Given the difficulties associated with the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], United Airlines and GoJet in cooperation with [[Bombardier Aviation]] stopped the conversion process of the CRJ-700 fleet in late March 2020 until after the full economic fallout of the virus is evaluated. It is not yet fully known how this work stoppage will affect the proposed CRJ-550 fleet plan.\n\n===CRJ-550 Information===\n\nThe [[United Express]] CRJ-550 is a modified [[Bombardier CRJ-700]]. Bombardier Aviation does not produce the CRJ-550 new from the factory. Many CRJ-550 aircraft are several years old in the GoJet fleet, the oldest (N503GJ) being close to 20 years old. CRJ-500 conversions are done on both the classic CRJ-700 and the NextGen CRJ-700 models. The process of converting the aircraft cabin is a relatively quick process where several economy seats of the 700 series are removed and replaced with large storage cabinets, a larger more modern service galley and updated First Class and Economy Plus seating. The four new cabinets installed at floor level allow passengers to stow larger carry on luggage in the cabin with them that would normally have needed to be checked plane side when on the CRJ-700. The new larger service galley allows passengers with first class seats the option of self serve snacks and beverages during the flight. The galley features a lighted glass cabinet with several snack options, a refrigerator with chilled non-alcoholic beverages, ice and bottled water drawers as well as a waste receptacle. For the cabin crew the new galley features a storage area for crew luggage. In the cabin the aircraft features 10 full size first class seats, 20 Economy Plus seats and 20 Economy seats. The whole aircraft receives new wall panels, carpeting, curtains, and signage. United is having all the CRJ-550 aircraft painted in their new blue and white livery. For pilots the aircraft is essentially a CRJ-700 with limited takeoff and landing weights to meet the [[United Airlines]] scope agreement with its pilots who are represented by the [[Airline Pilots Association]]. This agreement limits the CRJ-550 to a maximum takeoff weight of 65,000 pounds, 10,000 pounds less than the CRJ-700. The CRJ-550 is often restricted from taking full passenger loads when flying into areas where more precautionary fuel is needed such as areas with poor weather due to this reduced weight limit.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|United States|Companies|Aviation}}\n*[http://www.gojetairlines.com/ GoJet Airlines]\n*[http://www.airfleets.net/ageflotte/?file=calcop&opp=GoJet%20Airlines GoJet Airlines Fleet Age]\n*[http://www.planespotters.net/airline/GoJet-Airlines-%28United-Express%29 GoJet Airlines Fleet Detail]\n*[http://www.teamster.org/06news/nr_060224_1.asp/Teamsters Press Release]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Airlines of the United States}}\n{{United Express Carriers}}\n{{Delta Connection Carriers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gojet Airlines}}\n[[Category:Regional Airline Association members]]\n[[Category:Airlines established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Companies based in St. Louis County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Regional airlines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Airlines of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox airline\n| airline = GoJet Airlines\n| image = \n| logo = GoJet logo.gif\n| logo_size = 180px\n| fleet_size = 29\n| destinations = 80+\n| IATA = G7\n| ICAO = GJS\n| callsign = LINDBERGH\n| company_slogan = \n| parent = \n| founded = 2004\n| aoc = N6WA249L<ref name=\"FAA\">{{Cite web|url=https://av-info.faa.gov/detail.asp?DSGN_CODE=N6WA&OPER_FAR=121&OPER_NAME=GOJET+AIRLINES+LLC|title=Federal Aviation Administration - Airline Certificate Information - Detail View|website=av-info.faa.gov|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n| headquarters = [[Bridgeton, Missouri|Bridgeton]], [[Missouri]], [[United States|USA]]\n| key_people = Hulas Kanodia, Owner; Rick Leach, President\n| hubs = '''As [[United Express]]:'''<br>\n*[[Chicago-O'Hare]]\n*[[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]]\n| frequent_flyer = [[Mileage Plus]]<br>(United Express)<br>\n| lounge = \n| alliance = [[Star Alliance]] (United) <br>\n| website = http://www.gojetairlines.com/\n| num_employees = 1670\n}}\n\n'''GoJet Airlines LLC''' is a regional airline headquartered in [[Bridgeton, Missouri|Bridgeton]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]].

For the cabin crew the new galley features a storage area for crew luggage. In the cabin the aircraft features 10 full size first class seats, 20 Economy Plus seats and 20 Economy seats. The whole aircraft receives new wall panels, carpeting, curtains, and signage. United is having all the CRJ-550 aircraft painted in their new blue and white livery. For pilots the aircraft is essentially a CRJ-700 with limited takeoff and landing weights to meet the [[United Airlines]] scope agreement with its pilots who are represented by the [[Airline Pilots Association]]. This agreement limits the CRJ-550 to a maximum takeoff weight of 65,000 pounds, 10,000 pounds less than the CRJ-700. The CRJ-550 is often restricted from taking full passenger loads when flying into areas where more precautionary fuel is needed such as areas with poor weather due to this reduced weight limit.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|United States|Companies|Aviation}}\n*[http://www.gojetairlines.com/ GoJet Airlines]\n*[http://www.airfleets.net/ageflotte/?file=calcop&opp=GoJet%20Airlines GoJet Airlines Fleet Age]\n*[http://www.planespotters.net/airline/GoJet-Airlines-%28United-Express%29 GoJet Airlines Fleet Detail]\n*[http://www.teamster.org/06news/nr_060224_1.asp/Teamsters Press Release]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Airlines of the United States}}\n{{United Express Carriers}}\n{{Delta Connection Carriers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gojet Airlines}}\n[[Category:Regional Airline Association members]]\n[[Category:Airlines established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Companies based in St. Louis County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Regional airlines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Airlines of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "update", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoJet_Airlines"}

The interactions between bacteria, cancer cells, and the surrounding microenvironment cause various alterations in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines, which further facilitate tumor regression. \u2460 Bacterial toxins from S. Typhimurium, Listeria, and Clostridium can kill tumor cells directly by inducing apoptosis or autophagy. Toxins delivered via Salmonella can upregulate Connexin 43 (Cx43), leading to bacteria-induced gap junctions between the tumor and dendritic cells (DCs), which allow cross-presentation of tumor antigens to the DCs. \u2461 Upon exposure to tumor antigens and interaction with bacterial components, DCs secrete robust amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, which subsequently activates CD8+ T cells. \u2462 The antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells is further enhanced by bacterial flagellin (a protein subunit of the bacterial flagellum) via TLR5 activation. The perforin and granzyme proteins secreted by activated CD8+ T cells efficiently kill tumor cells in primary and metastatic tumors. \u2463 Flagellin and TLR5 signaling also decreases the abundance of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which subsequently improves the antitumor response of the activated CD8+ T cells. \u2464 S. Typhimurium flagellin stimulates NK cells to produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), an important cytokine for both innate and adaptive immunity. \u2465 Listeria-infected MDSCs shift into an immune-stimulating phenotype characterized by increased IL-12 production, which further enhances the CD8+ T and NK cell responses. \u2466 Both S. Typhimurium and Clostridium infection can stimulate significant neutrophil accumulation. Elevated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by neutrophils enhances the immune response and kills tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. \u2467 The macrophage inflammasome is activated through contact with bacterial components (LPS and flagellin) and Salmonella-damaged cancer cells, leading to elevated secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 into the tumor microenvironment.
