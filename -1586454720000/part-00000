{"title_page": "Radio Andorra", "text_new": "'''Radio Andorra''' was one of the oldest French private radio stations, which had a broadcast licence in [[Andorra]] from 1939 until 1981.\n\n==History==\nBroadcasting began on 7 August 1939 by [[Jacques Tr\u00e9moulet]], who was also the owner of the broadcasting company Radiophonie du Midi, which was already broadcast in [[Toulouse]], [[Montpellier]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Agen]]. With the location of Andorra it bypassed the [[state monopoly]] on broadcasting by not operating on French soil. On its first broadcast Radio Andorra was exclusively a music programme, interrupted only by the famous greeting \"Aqui Radio Andorra.\" During the [[Second World War]], the music programme was broadcast to the soldiers in France to North Africa. Both German and Allied forces attempted to control the radio without success because the neutrality of Andorra served as a protective shield. \n\nBy the end of the war Jacques Tr\u00e9moulet was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] by the French judiciary because of [[collaboration]]. He first fled to Spain, then to Switzerland, and finally to France, where he was acquitted in 1949. During this time, Radio Andorra was massively hindered, as it was hard to receive transmissions in France. \n\nAfter a slow climb in the 1950s and early 1960s [[Sud Radio]] competed with Radio Andorra. It was supported by the French government since its foundation in 1968. The last years of Radio Andorra were characterized by a lack of funds and a reduced power transmitter so that only in the vicinity of Andorra it could be heard. \n\nBecause of the desire for the establishment of a separate broadcasting network the Principality of Andorra broadcasting licence expired in 1981. However, the transmission towers, on the [[Lake Engolasters#Radio_tower|lake of Engolasters]] in [[Encamp]], are still standing.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://aquiradioandorra.free.fr/ Aqu\u00ed Radio Andorra: History (in French)]\n* [http://wikionlineradio.com/country/ad/ Wikionlineradio Andorra (in English)]\n* [http://f5nsl.free.fr/andorre/amenu.html Radio Andorra (in English and French)]\n\n{{coord|42.5287|N|1.5698|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Communications in Andorra]]\n[[Category:Andorra\u2013France relations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1939]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Andorra]]\n[[Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 disestablishments in Europe]]\n\n{{Andorra-stub}}\n", "text_old": "'''Radio Andorra''' was one of the oldest French private radio stations, which had a broadcast licence in [[Andorra]] from 1939 until 1981.\n\n==History==\nBroadcasting began on 7 August 1939 by [[Jacques Tr\u00e9moulet]], who was also the owner of the broadcasting company Radiophonie du Midi, which was already broadcast in [[Toulouse]], [[Montpellier]], [[Bordeaux]] and [[Agen]].

Both German and Allied forces attempted to control the radio without success because the neutrality of Andorra served as a protective shield. \n\nBy the end of the war Jacques Tr\u00e9moulet was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] by the French judiciary because of [[collaboration]]. He first fled to Spain, then to Switzerland, and finally to France, where he was acquitted in 1949. During this time, Radio Andorra was massively hindered, as it was hard to receive transmissions in France. \n\nAfter a slow climb in the 1950s and early 1960s [[Sud Radio]] competed with Radio Andorra. It was supported by the French government since its foundation in 1968. The last years of Radio Andorra were characterized by a lack of funds and a reduced power transmitter so that only in the vicinity of Andorra it could be heard. \n\nBecause of the desire for the establishment of a separate broadcasting network the Principality of Andorra broadcasting licence expired in 1981. However, the transmission towers, on the [[Lake Engolasters#Radio_tower|lake of Engolasters]] in [[Encamp]], are still standing.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://aquiradioandorra.free.fr/ Aqu\u00ed Radio Andorra: History (in French)]\n* [http://f5nsl.free.fr/andorre/amenu.html Radio Andorra (in English and French)]\n\n{{coord|42.5287|N|1.5698|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Communications in Andorra]]\n[[Category:Andorra\u2013France relations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1939]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Andorra]]\n[[Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 disestablishments in Europe]]\n\n{{Andorra-stub}}\n", "name_user": "5.90.15.112", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Andorra"}

It was originally released in May 1979 by [[RCA Records]]. The third and final release of the [[Berlin Trilogy]], following ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (both 1977), it was recorded in Switzerland and [[New York City]] with collaborator [[Brian Eno]] and producer [[Tony Visconti]]. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, ''Lodger'' contained no instrumentals and a somewhat more pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of [[world music]] and recording techniques inspired by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\"/>\n\nThe album was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered to be among Bowie's most underrated albums.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.335\u2013356</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.310\u2013312</ref> It was accompanied by several singles, including the UK Top 10 hit \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\".\n\nIt is one of Bowie's most influential works, particularly to the 1990s [[Britpop]] movement, with two major Britpop bands, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who named their 1996 number-one hit \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" after ''Lodger'''s \"[[Look Back in Anger (song)|Look Back in Anger]]\" and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], who used the same chord sequence as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" and \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" in their 1997 hit single \"[[M.O.R.]]\". The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Recording and production==\nOriginally to be titled either ''Planned Accidents'' or ''Despite Straight Lines'',<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> ''Lodger'' was largely recorded between legs of David Bowie's [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] and featured the same musicians, along with [[Brian Eno]]. The recording sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilize techniques from Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's Lodger Comes In From The Cold \u2013 Ben Graham, January 11th, 2016 00:35|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Experiments on the album included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians play unfamiliar instruments (as on \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\").<ref name=\"Q\"/> Lead guitar was played not by [[Robert Fripp]], as on ''\"Heroes\"'', but by Fripp's future [[King Crimson]] band member, [[Adrian Belew]], whom Bowie had \"poached\" while the guitarist was touring with [[Frank Zappa]]. Much of Belew's work on the album was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\nEno felt that the trilogy had \"petered out\" by ''Lodger'',<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">Ian Gittins (2007). \"Art Decade\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.70\u201373</ref> and Belew also observed Eno's and Bowie's working relationship closing down: \"They didn't quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn't seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the ''\"Heroes\"'' album.\"<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough missing the songs/instrumentals split that characterised ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', ''Lodger'' has been interpreted as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.102\u2013107</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\">Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: pp.172\u2013173</ref> The final track on ''\"Heroes\"'', \"[[The Secret Life of Arabia]]\", anticipated the mock-exotic feel of ''Lodger''{{'}}s travel songs. \"African Night Flight\" was a tribute to the music and culture of the [[veld]], inspired by a trip to [[Kenya]] that he took with his then-small son [[Duncan Jones|Zowie]];<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': pp.177\u2013191</ref> its musical textures have been cited as presaging the popularity of [[world music]], Bowie considering it a forerunner of the sounds developed by Brian Eno and [[David Byrne]] for ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/><ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/> \"Move On\" was lyrically Bowie's ode to his own wanderlust, sonically his earlier classic \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" played backwards.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"[[Yassassin]]\" was an unlikely [[reggae]] song with a [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] flavour. \"Red Sails\" was inspired in part by the music of German band [[Neu!]], sharing Neu!'s distinctive \"[[motorik]]\" drum beat;<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\"/> for Bowie, it combined \"a German new music feel\" with \"a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling [[Errol Flynn]]\" to produce \"a lovely cross-reference of cultures\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> \"Red Sails\" has also be compared with [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia's]] 1975 track \"Monza (Rauf und Runter)\".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/?s=red+sails |title= Pushing Ahead of the Dame |author= col1234 |accessdate= 11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOf the album's critiques, \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\", the first single, was seen by ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] partly as a witty riposte to the [[Village People]] but also, combined with its cross-dressing video clip, a comment on ideas of masculinity; musically it was notable for guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]] and drummer [[Dennis Davis]] in the unfamiliar roles of drummer and bass player, respectively.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> According to [[Tony Visconti]], the song featured the \"exact same chord changes and structure, even the same key\" as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\", Bowie's take on the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000).

It was originally released in May 1979 by [[RCA Records]]. The third and final release of the [[Berlin Trilogy]], following ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (both 1977), it was recorded in Switzerland and [[New York City]] with collaborator [[Brian Eno]] and producer [[Tony Visconti]]. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, ''Lodger'' contained no instrumentals and a somewhat more pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of [[world music]] and recording techniques inspired by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\"/>\n\nThe album was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered to be among Bowie's most underrated albums.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.335\u2013356</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.310\u2013312</ref> It was accompanied by several singles, including the UK Top 10 hit \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\".\n\nIt is one of Bowie's most influential works, particularly to the 1990s [[Britpop]] movement, with two major Britpop bands, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who named their 1996 number-one hit \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" after ''Lodger'''s \"[[Look Back in Anger (song)|Look Back in Anger]]\" and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], who used the same chord sequence as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" and \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" in their 1997 hit single \"[[M.O.R.]]\". The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Recording and production==\nOriginally to be titled either ''Planned Accidents'' or ''Despite Straight Lines'',<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> ''Lodger'' was largely recorded between legs of David Bowie's [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] and featured the same musicians, along with [[Brian Eno]]. The recording sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilize techniques from Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's Lodger Comes In From The Cold \u2013 Ben Graham, January 11th, 2016 00:35|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Experiments on the album included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians play unfamiliar instruments (as on \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\").<ref name=\"Q\"/> Lead guitar was played not by [[Robert Fripp]], as on ''\"Heroes\"'', but by Fripp's future [[King Crimson]] band member, [[Adrian Belew]], whom Bowie had \"poached\" while the guitarist was touring with [[Frank Zappa]]. Much of Belew's work on the album was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\nEno felt that the trilogy had \"petered out\" by ''Lodger'',<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">Ian Gittins (2007). \"Art Decade\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.70\u201373</ref> and Belew also observed Eno's and Bowie's working relationship closing down: \"They didn't quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn't seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the ''\"Heroes\"'' album.\"<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough missing the songs/instrumentals split that characterised ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', ''Lodger'' has been interpreted as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.102\u2013107</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\">Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: pp.172\u2013173</ref> The final track on ''\"Heroes\"'', \"[[The Secret Life of Arabia]]\", anticipated the mock-exotic feel of ''Lodger''{{'}}s travel songs. \"African Night Flight\" was a tribute to the music and culture of the [[veld]], inspired by a trip to [[Kenya]] that he took with his then-small son [[Duncan Jones|Zowie]];<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': pp.177\u2013191</ref> its musical textures have been cited as presaging the popularity of [[world music]], Bowie considering it a forerunner of the sounds developed by Brian Eno and [[David Byrne]] for ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/><ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/> \"Move On\" was lyrically Bowie's ode to his own wanderlust, sonically his earlier classic \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" played backwards.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"[[Yassassin]]\" was an unlikely [[reggae]] song with a [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] flavour. \"Red Sails\" was inspired in part by the music of German band [[Neu!]], sharing Neu!'s distinctive \"[[motorik]]\" drum beat;<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\"/> for Bowie, it combined \"a German new music feel\" with \"a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling [[Errol Flynn]]\" to produce \"a lovely cross-reference of cultures\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> \"Red Sails\" has also be compared with [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia's]] 1975 track \"Monza (Rauf und Runter)\".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/?s=red+sails |title= Pushing Ahead of the Dame |author= col1234 |accessdate= 11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOf the album's critiques, \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\", the first single, was seen by ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] partly as a witty riposte to the [[Village People]] but also, combined with its cross-dressing video clip, a comment on ideas of masculinity; musically it was notable for guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]] and drummer [[Dennis Davis]] in the unfamiliar roles of drummer and bass player, respectively.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> According to [[Tony Visconti]], the song featured the \"exact same chord changes and structure, even the same key\" as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\", Bowie's take on the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: p.74</ref> The second single, \"[[DJ (David Bowie song)|DJ]]\", took a sardonic look at the world of the disc jockey. \"Repetition\", Bowie's exploration of the mind of an [[domestic violence|abusive partner]], was sung in a deliberately unemotional tone that highlighted the lyric and the unnatural slur of the bass guitar.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"Red Money\" added new words to a Bowie/Alomar tune that had originally appeared as \"Sister Midnight\", with lyrics by Bowie and [[Iggy Pop]], on the latter's album ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]''.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\n==Packaging==\nBowie collaborated with English pop artist [[Derek Boshier]] on the [[cover art|cover design]]. The original gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot of Bowie by photographer [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] as an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose. For effect, the image was deliberately of low resolution, taken with a [[Polaroid SX-70|Polaroid SX-70 type camera]]. The inside of the gatefold included pictures of [[Che Guevara]]'s corpse, [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation of Christ]]'' and Bowie being readied for the cover photo.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/><ref>[http://www.derekboshier.com/gate/pages/bowie.html Derek Boshier Web Site]</ref> These images were not reproduced in the [[Rykodisc]] CD reissue in 1991.\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Lodger \u2013 David Bowie|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lodger-mw0000251982|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n| rev2       = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie Part 1: The 1960s and '70s|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006}}</ref>\n| rev3       = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3Score  = {{Rating|2.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled On Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n| rev4       = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score  = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev5       = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev5score  = B+<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ira|title=Lodger|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1991/11/01/lodger|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1 November 1991|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n| rev6       = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score  = 8.5/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Mike|title=David Bowie: Lodger|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21476-lodger/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n| rev7       = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Lodger|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=61|date=October 1991}}</ref>\n| rev8       = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=David Bowie|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n| rev9       = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84}}</ref>\n| rev10      = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv7-79.php|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=30 July 1979|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n''Lodger'' received relatively poor reviews on its original release, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling it \"one of his weakest&nbsp;... scattered, a footnote to ''\"Heroes\"'', an act of marking time\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Greil|authorlink=Greil Marcus|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/lodger-19790809|title=Lodger|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=9 August 1979|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' finding it \"slightly faceless\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> In ''[[Smash Hits]]'' the album was described as sounding like \"a ragbag of rejects from previous styles\" with \"only occasional flashes of genius\".<ref name=\"SmashHits\">{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Red|title=Albums|journal=[[Smash Hits]]|issue=31 May \u2013 13 June 1979|page=25}}</ref> It was also criticised for having a thinner, muddier mix than Bowie's previous albums.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] wrote favourably of the album in ''[[The Village Voice]]''.
