The Irish elk was a prime example because it had evolved from a smaller ancestor with smaller antlers. In terms of the Irish elk, orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species' extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches.<ref name=Hughes />\n\nIn the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by [[Julian Huxley]], who noted that antler size was relative to body size. Because the Irish elk was a large organism compared to its smaller relatives such as deer, there was an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship between the antlers and body size.<ref>Anderson, Kristina. \"What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.\" What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.

This reduction in antler mass is 2.7 times more extreme than expected given the allometric relationship between antler and body masses in red deer<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> and demonstrates a rapid evolution of smaller antlers. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having {{cvt|35|kg}} antlers<ref name=\"barnosky86\"/> would result in antler weights of {{cvt|13|kg}} or less in worsening climatic conditions.

The antlers of the Irish elk should have been able to evolve rapidly in the face of selection for smaller and less expensive sizes. This conclusion is supported by the great diversity of Irish elk antler forms found among different populations at different times, including compact upright orientations possibly from populations inhabiting more heavily wooded environments<ref>Lister 1994</ref> suggesting the evolutionary malleability of Irish elk antlers.\"<ref name=\"Worman\"/> Ultimately, the decrease in energy intake by the Late Pleistocene, influenced the ability to produce for Irish elk females.<ref name=\"Worman\">{{cite journal |last2= Kimbrell|first2= Tristan|title= Getting to the hart of the matter: Did antlers truly cause the extinction of the Irish elk?|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff4d412edd3dcb9f15a1321f780f507468024bf3|journal= Oikos|volume= 117|issue= 9|pages= 1397\u20131405|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16608.x|year= 2008|last1= O'Driscoll Worman|first1= Cedric}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Knight Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]\nFrequent debates occur as to whether or not sexual selection led to the Irish elk's extinction. Sexual selection can increase or decrease a population's chance of extinction, due to behaviours such as male-male competition and female choice. Also, sexual harassment by males can result in lower female fecundity or even death.<ref name=\"Kokko\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H. | last2 = Brooks | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = Sexy to die for? sexual selection and the risk of extinction | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/18804232 | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 207\u2013219 }}</ref> Regardless of the details of the species' life history, extinction would require that too few males survive to maturity to fertilize a sufficient number of females to maintain a viable population.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> When it comes to male-male competition, if the assumption is that detrimental effects are clear in only the males, a surviving male would have a large number of females to choose from, with little competition. Selection must, therefore, favour the less extreme male genotypes, and generating a scenario seems impossible where males with larger antlers are still selected for when the lifetime reproductive success of males with large antlers approaches zero (as required for deterministic extinction to occur).<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nIn female choice, sexual selection could, thus, reinforce natural selection and lead to quicker responses to environmental changes, should they occur.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> With a decrease in male population, females have fewer choices, which could result in inbreeding. This can pose significant threats to population survival.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> However, many of these studies are contradicting. Females may adaptively avoid the accumulation of inbreeding, so that female choice might increase effective population size.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nLate Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> This type of segregation implies that the Irish elk had behaviours such as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] and polygynous mating systems, where a single male mates with two or more females. This also supports the belief that the large antler size was used for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/>\n\n===Habitat===\nNeither exclusive to Ireland nor an elk, it was named so because the most well-known and best-preserved fossil specimens have been found in lake sediments and [[peat bog]]s in Ireland. The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, being located throughout Europe, northern Africa, and some related forms located in China.\n\nThe Irish elk prioritized open grassland habitats and was in fact the most [[cursorial]] cervid known.<ref>Geist, V. 1999. Deer of the World. Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury.</ref> Other ungulates that prefer open habitats, including the related [[fallow deer]], typically have more ostentatious colour patterns.\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|Sculptures in [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]]]]\nA number of hypotheses are easy to advance regarding the disappearance of the more localized populations of this species. The situation is less clear regarding the final demise of the Irish elk in continental Eurasia east of the Urals. Stuart ''et al.'' (2004) tentatively suggest that a combination of human presence along rivers and slow decrease in habitat quality in upland areas presented the last Irish elk with the choice of either good habitat with considerable hunting pressure, or general absence of humans in a suboptimal habitat.\n\nTraditionally, discussion of the cause of their extinction has focused on the antler size (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by humans was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish elk, as may have been the case with other prehistoric [[megafauna]], even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a \"[[maladaptation]]\".<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> Others assume the ultimate cause of extinction may have been the adaptations for mineral metabolism that were beneficial to the Irish elk until vegetation changed.<ref name=\"moen99\">{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=Ron A.|first2=John|last2=Pastor |first3=Yosef|last3=Cohen |title=Antler growth and extinction of Irish elk|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=1999|pages=235\u2013249|url=http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~rmoen/Dld/Moen_1999.pdf}}</ref> But given the difficulty of recovering quantitative records of human hunting impacts from the sub-fossil record alone, the role of humans in the extinction of the Irish elk is not yet clear.\n\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality [[forage]] caused the extinction of the elk. According to an article written by researchers Silvia Gonzalez, Andrew Kitcheneri, and Adrian Lister, in 2000, a reduction in forest density into the Late Pleistocene decreased nutritional selection and is believed to have led to a conflict between sexual selection and ultimately a decrease in antler and body size, which can explain what may have caused their demise.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Silvia|author2=Andrew Kitchener |author3=Adrian Lister |title=Survival of the Irish elk into the Holocene|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6788|pages=753\u2013754|doi=10.1038/35015668|pmid=10866185}}</ref> High amounts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] compounds are required to form antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive structures of the Irish elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly from their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or reclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer). Thus, in the antler growth phase, giant deer suffered from a condition similar to [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"moen99\" /> When the climate changed at the end of the [[last glacial period]], the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\n\nSimply blaming antler size for their extinction may not be entirely accurate. The most likely cause is the significantly shortened growing season seen toward the end of the Pleistocene Era. This reduced availability in nutrition resulted in the lowering of the female reproduction output by about 50%.<ref name=\"Worman\"/>\n\nHowever, the most recent specimen of ''M. giganteus'' in northern Siberia, dated to approximately 7,700 years ago &mdash; well after the end of the last glacial period &mdash; shows no sign of nutrient stress. This specimen came from a region with a [[continental climate]] where the proposed vegetation changes had not yet occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.02.004 | pmid=16556506 | volume=40 | title=Molecular phylogeny of the extinct giant deer, Megaloceros giganteus | year=2006 | journal=Mol.

Giant deer fossils found on the [[Isle of Man]] at Ballaugh confirm the survival of the species into early Holocene in at least this area. The [[Ballaugh Elk]] skeleton is smaller than the entire range of Irish skeletons, but has a relatively large skull and the antlers are well-sized for an adult male. This suggests that size decreased into the Holocene.\n\nThere is strong intraspecific [[allometry]] among Irish deer. Smaller animals have relatively shorter antlers. Reduced display organs are theorized to indicate a prelude to extinction from nutritional stress. Reduced forage density leads to a conflict between sexual selection for antler size and nutritional selection pressures. These factors reduced populations and the body size of the giant deer. However, data indicates that they are unlikely to have been wholly responsible for the animal's extinction. With available evidence, it is hard to define the cause of extinction.\n\nMany scientists argue that factors like ecological change, virulent disease, and hunting by people wiped out many large mammal species during the end of the European Ice age, including the giant deer. Fossils found on the Isle of Man at Ballaugh, and at two places in western Siberia postdating the supposed extinction of the species show that, whatever the causes, the actual termination of the species was likely due to a variety of factors which had different significance and timing in different parts of the species' range.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>Irish Elk Survived after Ice Age Ended Author(s): S.

The Irish elk was a prime example because it had evolved from a smaller ancestor with smaller antlers. In terms of the Irish elk, orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species' extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches.<ref name=Hughes />\n\nIn the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by [[Julian Huxley]], who noted that antler size was relative to body size. Because the Irish elk was a large organism compared to its smaller relatives such as deer, there was an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship between the antlers and body size.<ref>Anderson, Kristina. \"What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.\" What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.

In body size, the Irish elk tied with the extant [[Alaska moose|moose subspecies of Alaska]] (''Alces alces gigas'') as the third largest known deer, second and first belonging to the genus ''[[Cervalces]]'' ([[Stag-moose|''C. scotti'']] and [[Cervalces latifrons|''C.latifrons'']] respectively).

Because basal circumference is highly correlated with other linear measures of antler size,<ref>Barto\u0161 and Bahbouh 2006</ref> such a decrease indicates that insular antler mass dropped to {{frac|1|14}} of the mainland antler mass. This reduction in antler mass is 2.7 times more extreme than expected given the allometric relationship between antler and body masses in red deer<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> and demonstrates a rapid evolution of smaller antlers. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having {{cvt|35|kg}} antlers<ref name=\"barnosky86\"/> would result in antler weights of {{cvt|13|kg}} or less in worsening climatic conditions. This estimate is within the range of extant wapiti/red deer (''Cervus'' spp.) antler weights.<ref name=\"geist\"/>\n\nIrish elk stags in more adverse environments had smaller bodies and relatively even smaller antlers,<ref name=\"moen99\"/><ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> but proponents of the antler-extinction hypothesis have not addressed the possibility of rapid evolutionary reduction in antler size. The antlers of the Irish elk should have been able to evolve rapidly in the face of selection for smaller and less expensive sizes. This conclusion is supported by the great diversity of Irish elk antler forms found among different populations at different times, including compact upright orientations possibly from populations inhabiting more heavily wooded environments<ref>Lister 1994</ref> suggesting the evolutionary malleability of Irish elk antlers.\"<ref name=\"Worman\"/> Ultimately, the decrease in energy intake by the Late Pleistocene, influenced the ability to produce for Irish elk females.<ref name=\"Worman\">{{cite journal |last2= Kimbrell|first2= Tristan|title= Getting to the hart of the matter: Did antlers truly cause the extinction of the Irish elk?|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff4d412edd3dcb9f15a1321f780f507468024bf3|journal= Oikos|volume= 117|issue= 9|pages= 1397\u20131405|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16608.x|year= 2008|last1= O'Driscoll Worman|first1= Cedric}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Knight Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]\nFrequent debates occur as to whether or not sexual selection led to the Irish elk's extinction. Sexual selection can increase or decrease a population's chance of extinction, due to behaviours such as male-male competition and female choice. Also, sexual harassment by males can result in lower female fecundity or even death.<ref name=\"Kokko\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H. | last2 = Brooks | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = Sexy to die for? sexual selection and the risk of extinction | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/18804232 | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 207\u2013219 }}</ref> Regardless of the details of the species' life history, extinction would require that too few males survive to maturity to fertilize a sufficient number of females to maintain a viable population.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> When it comes to male-male competition, if the assumption is that detrimental effects are clear in only the males, a surviving male would have a large number of females to choose from, with little competition. Selection must, therefore, favour the less extreme male genotypes, and generating a scenario seems impossible where males with larger antlers are still selected for when the lifetime reproductive success of males with large antlers approaches zero (as required for deterministic extinction to occur).<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nIn female choice, sexual selection could, thus, reinforce natural selection and lead to quicker responses to environmental changes, should they occur.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> With a decrease in male population, females have fewer choices, which could result in inbreeding. This can pose significant threats to population survival.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> However, many of these studies are contradicting. Females may adaptively avoid the accumulation of inbreeding, so that female choice might increase effective population size.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nLate Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> This type of segregation implies that the Irish elk had behaviours such as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] and polygynous mating systems, where a single male mates with two or more females. This also supports the belief that the large antler size was used for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/>\n\n===Habitat===\nNeither exclusive to Ireland nor an elk, it was named so because the most well-known and best-preserved fossil specimens have been found in lake sediments and [[peat bog]]s in Ireland. The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, being located throughout Europe, northern Africa, and some related forms located in China.\n\nThe Irish elk prioritized open grassland habitats and was in fact the most [[cursorial]] cervid known.<ref>Geist, V. 1999. Deer of the World. Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury.</ref> Other ungulates that prefer open habitats, including the related [[fallow deer]], typically have more ostentatious colour patterns.\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|Sculptures in [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]]]]\nA number of hypotheses are easy to advance regarding the disappearance of the more localized populations of this species. The situation is less clear regarding the final demise of the Irish elk in continental Eurasia east of the Urals. Stuart ''et al.'' (2004) tentatively suggest that a combination of human presence along rivers and slow decrease in habitat quality in upland areas presented the last Irish elk with the choice of either good habitat with considerable hunting pressure, or general absence of humans in a suboptimal habitat.\n\nTraditionally, discussion of the cause of their extinction has focused on the antler size (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by humans was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish elk, as may have been the case with other prehistoric [[megafauna]], even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a \"[[maladaptation]]\".<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> Others assume the ultimate cause of extinction may have been the adaptations for mineral metabolism that were beneficial to the Irish elk until vegetation changed.<ref name=\"moen99\">{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=Ron A.|first2=John|last2=Pastor |first3=Yosef|last3=Cohen |title=Antler growth and extinction of Irish elk|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=1999|pages=235\u2013249|url=http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~rmoen/Dld/Moen_1999.pdf}}</ref> But given the difficulty of recovering quantitative records of human hunting impacts from the sub-fossil record alone, the role of humans in the extinction of the Irish elk is not yet clear.\n\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality [[forage]] caused the extinction of the elk. According to an article written by researchers Silvia Gonzalez, Andrew Kitcheneri, and Adrian Lister, in 2000, a reduction in forest density into the Late Pleistocene decreased nutritional selection and is believed to have led to a conflict between sexual selection and ultimately a decrease in antler and body size, which can explain what may have caused their demise.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Silvia|author2=Andrew Kitchener |author3=Adrian Lister |title=Survival of the Irish elk into the Holocene|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6788|pages=753\u2013754|doi=10.1038/35015668|pmid=10866185}}</ref> High amounts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] compounds are required to form antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive structures of the Irish elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly from their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or reclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer). Thus, in the antler growth phase, giant deer suffered from a condition similar to [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"moen99\" /> When the climate changed at the end of the [[last glacial period]], the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\n\nSimply blaming antler size for their extinction may not be entirely accurate. The most likely cause is the significantly shortened growing season seen toward the end of the Pleistocene Era. This reduced availability in nutrition resulted in the lowering of the female reproduction output by about 50%.<ref name=\"Worman\"/>\n\nHowever, the most recent specimen of ''M. giganteus'' in northern Siberia, dated to approximately 7,700 years ago &mdash; well after the end of the last glacial period &mdash; shows no sign of nutrient stress. This specimen came from a region with a [[continental climate]] where the proposed vegetation changes had not yet occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.02.004 | pmid=16556506 | volume=40 | title=Molecular phylogeny of the extinct giant deer, Megaloceros giganteus | year=2006 | journal=Mol.

Giant deer fossils found on the [[Isle of Man]] at Ballaugh confirm the survival of the species into early Holocene in at least this area. The [[Ballaugh Elk]] skeleton is smaller than the entire range of Irish skeletons, but has a relatively large skull and the antlers are well-sized for an adult male. This suggests that size decreased into the Holocene.\n\nThere is strong intraspecific [[allometry]] among Irish deer. Smaller animals have relatively shorter antlers. Reduced display organs are theorized to indicate a prelude to extinction from nutritional stress. Reduced forage density leads to a conflict between sexual selection for antler size and nutritional selection pressures. These factors reduced populations and the body size of the giant deer. However, data indicates that they are unlikely to have been wholly responsible for the animal's extinction. With available evidence, it is hard to define the cause of extinction.\n\nMany scientists argue that factors like ecological change, virulent disease, and hunting by people wiped out many large mammal species during the end of the European Ice age, including the giant deer. Fossils found on the Isle of Man at Ballaugh, and at two places in western Siberia postdating the supposed extinction of the species show that, whatever the causes, the actual termination of the species was likely due to a variety of factors which had different significance and timing in different parts of the species' range.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>Irish Elk Survived after Ice Age Ended Author(s): S.

This is similar to the ''everything is an object'' philosophy used by some [[object-oriented programming]] languages.\n\nAn actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:\n* send a finite number of messages to other actors;\n* create a finite number of new actors;\n* designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.\n\nThere is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be carried out in parallel.\n\nDecoupling the sender from communications sent was a fundamental advance of the actor model enabling [[asynchronous communication]] and control structures as patterns of [[message passing|passing messages]].<ref>Carl Hewitt.

It can obtain those from a message it receives, or if the address is for an actor it has itself created.\n\nThe actor model is characterized by inherent concurrency of computation within and among actors, dynamic creation of actors, inclusion of actor addresses in messages, and interaction only through direct asynchronous [[message passing]] with no restriction on message arrival order.\n\n== Formal systems ==\nOver the years, several different formal systems have been developed which permit reasoning about systems in the actor model.

K. Guo|title=Formalizing Actors in Linear Logic|publisher=International Conference on Object-Oriented Information Systems|year=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}\nThe actor model can be used as a framework for modeling, understanding, and reasoning about a wide range of [[concurrent systems]]. For example:\n\n* Electronic mail ([[email]]) can be modeled as an actor system. Accounts are modeled as actors and [[email address]]es as actor addresses.\n* [[Web service]]s can be modeled with Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) endpoints modeled as actor addresses.\n* Objects with [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]s (''e.g.'', as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) can be modeled as a ''serializer'', provided that their implementations are such that messages can continually arrive (perhaps by being stored in an internal [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]]). A serializer is an important kind of actor defined by the property that it is continually available to the arrival of new messages; every message sent to a serializer is guaranteed to arrive.\n* Testing and Test Control Notation ([[TTCN]]), both TTCN-2 and [[TTCN-3]], follows actor model rather closely. In TTCN actor is a test component: either parallel test component (PTC) or main test component (MTC). Test components can send and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer test components or test system interface), the latter being identified by its address. Each test component has a behaviour tree bound to it; test components run in parallel and can be dynamically created by parent test components. Built-in language constructs allow the definition of actions to be taken when an expected message is received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to another peer entity or creating new test components.\n\n==Message-passing semantics==\nThe actor model is about the semantics of [[message passing]].\n\n=== Unbounded nondeterminism controversy ===\nArguably, the first concurrent programs were [[interrupt handler]]s. During the course of its normal operation a computer needed to be able to receive information from outside (characters from a keyboard, packets from a network, ''etc''). So when the information arrived the execution of the computer was ''interrupted'' and special code (called an interrupt handler) was called to put the information in a [[data buffer]] where it could be subsequently retrieved.\n\nIn the early 1960s, interrupts began to be used to simulate the concurrent execution of several programs on one processor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |title=The Origins of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls |isbn=978-0-387-95401-1 |publisher=Springer |year=2002}}</ref> Having concurrency with [[shared memory]] gave rise to the problem of [[concurrency control]]. Originally, this problem was conceived as being one of [[mutual exclusion]] on a single computer. [[Edsger Dijkstra]] developed [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] and later, between 1971 and 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=1996 |title=Monitors and Concurrent Pascal: A Personal History |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=121\u2013172}}</ref> [[Tony Hoare]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoare |first=Tony |author-link=Tony Hoare |date=October 1974 |title=Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=549\u2013557|doi=10.1145/355620.361161 }}</ref> and [[Per Brinch Hansen]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=July 1973 |title=Operating System Principles |publisher=Prentice-Hall}}</ref> developed [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitors]] to solve the mutual exclusion problem. However, neither of these solutions provided a programming language construct that encapsulated access to shared resources. This encapsulation was later accomplished by the [[Serialization|serializer]] construct ([Hewitt and Atkinson 1977, 1979] and [Atkinson 1980]).\n\nThe first models of computation (''e.g.'', [[Turing machines]], Post productions, the [[lambda calculus]], ''etc.'') were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a computational ''step'' (later generalized in [McCarthy and Hayes 1969] and [Dijkstra 1976] see [[Actor model early history#Event orderings versus global state|Event orderings versus global state]]). Each computational step was from one global state of the computation to the next global state. The global state approach was continued in [[automata theory]] for [[finite-state machine]]s and push down [[stack machine]]s, including their [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic]] versions. Such nondeterministic automata have the property of [[unbounded nondeterminism|bounded nondeterminism]]; that is, if a machine always halts when started in its initial state, then there is a bound on the number of states in which it halts.\n\n[[Edsger Dijkstra]] further developed the nondeterministic global state approach. Dijkstra's model gave rise to a controversy concerning [[unbounded nondeterminism]] (also called ''unbounded indeterminacy''), a property of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] by which the amount of delay in servicing a request can become unbounded as a result of arbitration of contention for shared resources ''while still guaranteeing that the request will eventually be serviced''. Hewitt argued that the actor model should provide the guarantee of service. In Dijkstra's model, although there could be an unbounded amount of time between the execution of sequential instructions on a computer, a (parallel) program that started out in a well defined state could terminate in only a bounded number of states [Dijkstra 1976]. Consequently, his model could not provide the guarantee of service. Dijkstra argued that it was impossible to implement unbounded nondeterminism.\n\nHewitt argued otherwise: there is no bound that can be placed on how long it takes a computational circuit called an ''[[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiter]]'' to settle (see [[metastability (electronics)]]).<ref name=\"zenil\">{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Hewitt |date=2012 |chapter=What is computation?

This was a sharp break with previous approaches to models of concurrent computation. The lack of buffering caused a great deal of misunderstanding at the time of the development of the actor model and is still a controversial issue. Some researchers argued that the messages are buffered in the \"ether\" or the \"environment\". Also, messages in the actor model are simply sent (like [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] in [[Internet Protocol|IP]]); there is no requirement for a synchronous handshake with the recipient.\n\n===Actor creation plus addresses in messages means variable topology===\nA natural development of the actor model was to allow addresses in messages. Influenced by [[Packet switching|packet switched networks]] [1961 and 1964], Hewitt proposed the development of a new model of concurrent computation in which communications would not have any required fields at all: they could be empty. Of course, if the sender of a communication desired a recipient to have access to addresses which the recipient did not already have, the address would have to be sent in the communication.\n\nFor example, an actor might need to send a message to a recipient actor from which it later expects to receive a response, but the response will actually be handled by a third actor component that has been configured to receive and handle the response (for example, a different actor implementing the [[observer pattern]]). The original actor could accomplish this by sending a communication that includes the message it wishes to send, along with the address of the third actor that will handle the response. This third actor that will handle the response is called the ''resumption'' (sometimes also called a [[continuation]] or [[stack frame]]). When the recipient actor is ready to send a response, it sends the response message to the ''resumption'' actor address that was included in the original communication.\n\nSo, the ability of actors to create new actors with which they can exchange communications, along with the ability to include the addresses of other actors in messages, gives actors the ability to create and participate in arbitrarily variable topological relationships with one another, much as the objects in Simula and other object-oriented languages may also be relationally composed into variable topologies of message-exchanging objects.\n\n===Inherently concurrent===\nAs opposed to the previous approach based on composing sequential processes, the actor model was developed as an inherently concurrent model. In the actor model sequentiality was a special case that derived from concurrent computation as explained in [[actor model theory]].\n\n===No requirement on order of message arrival===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nHewitt argued against adding the requirement that messages must arrive in the order in which they are sent to the actor. If output message ordering is desired, then it can be modeled by a queue actor that provides this functionality. Such a queue actor would queue the messages that arrived so that they could be retrieved in [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] order. So if an actor <tt>X</tt> sent a message <tt>M1</tt> to an actor <tt>Y</tt>, and later <tt>X</tt> sent another message <tt>M2</tt> to <tt>Y</tt>, there is no requirement that <tt>M1</tt> arrives at <tt>Y</tt> before <tt>M2</tt>.\n\nIn this respect the actor model mirrors [[packet switching]] systems which do not guarantee that packets must be received in the order sent. Not providing the order of delivery guarantee allows packet switching to buffer packets, use multiple paths to send packets, resend damaged packets, and to provide other optimizations.\n\nFor example, actors are allowed to pipeline the processing of messages. What this means is that in the course of processing a message <tt>M1</tt>, an actor can designate the behavior to be used to process the next message, and then in fact begin processing another message <tt>M2</tt> before it has finished processing <tt>M1</tt>. Just because an actor is allowed to pipeline the processing of messages does not mean that it ''must'' pipeline the processing. Whether a message is pipelined is an engineering tradeoff. How would an external observer know whether the processing of a message by an actor has been pipelined? There is no ambiguity in the definition of an actor created by the possibility of pipelining. Of course, it is possible to perform the pipeline optimization incorrectly in some implementations, in which case unexpected behavior may occur.\n\n===Locality===\nAnother important characteristic of the actor model is locality.\n\nLocality means that in processing a message, an actor can send messages only to addresses that it receives in the message, addresses that it already had before it received the message, and addresses for actors that it creates while processing the message. (But see [[#Synthesizing addresses of actors|Synthesizing addresses of actors]].)\n\nAlso locality means that there is no simultaneous change in multiple locations. In this way it differs from some other models of concurrency, ''e.g.'', the [[Petri net]] model in which tokens are simultaneously removed from multiple locations and placed in other locations.\n\n===Composing actor systems===\nThe idea of composing actor systems into larger ones is an important aspect of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] that was developed in Gul Agha's doctoral dissertation,<ref name=\"agha1986\"/> developed later by Gul Agha, Ian Mason, Scott Smith, and [[Carolyn Talcott]].<ref name=\"agha1993\"/>\n\n===Behaviors===\nA key innovation was the introduction of ''behavior'' specified as a mathematical function to express what an actor does when it processes a message, including specifying a new behavior to process the next message that arrives. Behaviors provided a mechanism to mathematically model the sharing in concurrency.\n\nBehaviors also freed the actor model from implementation details, ''e.g.'', the Smalltalk-72 token stream interpreter. However, it is critical to understand that the efficient implementation of systems described by the actor model require ''extensive'' optimization. See [[Actor model implementation]] for details.\n\n=== Modeling other concurrency systems ===\nOther concurrency systems (''e.g.'', [[process calculi]]) can be modeled in the actor model using a [[two-phase commit protocol]].<ref>Frederick Knabe. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick_Knabe/publication/2823488_A_Distributed_Protocol_for_Channel-Based_Communication_with_Choice/links/00463536b853ab72ef000000.pdf A Distributed Protocol for Channel-Based Communication with Choice PARLE 1992].</ref>\n\n=== Computational Representation Theorem ===\n{{see also|Denotational semantics of the Actor model}}\nThere is a ''Computational Representation Theorem'' in the actor model for systems which are closed in the sense that they do not receive communications from outside. The mathematical denotation denoted by a closed system <tt>S</tt> is constructed from an initial behavior <tt>\u22a5<sub>S</sub></tt> and a behavior-approximating function <tt>'''progression'''<sub>S</sub></tt>. These obtain increasingly better approximations and construct a denotation (meaning) for <tt>S</tt> as follows [Hewitt 2008; Clinger 1981]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Denote}_{\\mathtt{S}} \\equiv \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{progression}_{\\mathtt{S}^i}(\\bot_\\mathtt{S})</math>\n\nIn this way, <tt>S</tt> can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its possible behaviors (including those involving unbounded nondeterminism). Although <tt>Denote<sub>S</sub></tt> is not an implementation of <tt>S</tt>, it can be used to prove a generalization of the Church-Turing-Rosser-Kleene thesis [Kleene 1943]:\n\nA consequence of the above theorem is that a finite actor can nondeterministically respond with an {{clarify span|uncountable|reason=Uncountability is the property of real numbers, this sounds like (countably) infinite was meant|date=November 2013}} number of different outputs.\n\n===Relationship to logic programming===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nOne of the key motivations for the development of the actor model was to understand and deal with the control structure issues that arose in development of the [[Planner programming language]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Once the actor model was initially defined, an important challenge was to understand the power of the model relative to [[Robert Kowalski]]'s thesis that \"computation can be subsumed by deduction\". Hewitt argued that Kowalski's thesis turned out to be false for the concurrent computation in the actor model (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]).\n\nNevertheless, attempts were made to extend [[logic programming]] to concurrent computation. However, Hewitt and Agha [1991] claimed that the resulting systems were not deductive in the following sense: computational steps of the concurrent logic programming systems do not follow deductively from previous steps (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]). Recently, logic programming has been integrated into the actor model in a way that maintains logical semantics.<ref name=\"zenil\"/>\n\n===Migration===\nMigration in the actor model is the ability of actors to change locations. ''E.g.'', in his dissertation, Aki Yonezawa modeled a post office that customer actors could enter, change locations within while operating, and exit. An actor that can migrate can be modeled by having a location actor that changes when the actor migrates. However the faithfulness of this modeling is controversial and the subject of research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Security===\nThe security of actors can be protected in the following ways:\n* [[Hardwired control|hardwiring]] in which actors are physically connected\n* [[computer hardware]] as in [[Burroughs B5000]], [[Lisp machine]], ''etc.''\n* [[virtual machines]] as in [[Java virtual machine]], [[Common Language Runtime]], ''etc.''\n* [[operating systems]] as in [[capability-based security|capability-based systems]]\n* [[Digital signature|signing]] and/or [[encryption]] of actors and their addresses\n\n===Synthesizing addresses of actors===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nA delicate point in the actor model is the ability to synthesize the address of an actor. In some cases security can be used to prevent the synthesis of addresses (see [[#Security|Security]]). However, if an actor address is simply a bit string then clearly it can be synthesized although it may be difficult or even infeasible to guess the address of an actor if the bit strings are long enough. [[SOAP]] uses a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] for the address of an endpoint where an actor can be reached. Since a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] is a character string, it can clearly be synthesized although encryption can make it virtually impossible to guess.\n\nSynthesizing the addresses of actors is usually modeled using mapping. The idea is to use an actor system to perform the mapping to the actual actor addresses. For example, on a computer the memory structure of the computer can be modeled as an actor system that does the mapping. In the case of [[SOAP]] addresses, it's modeling the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and the rest of the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] mapping.\n\n===Contrast with other models of message-passing concurrency===\n[[Robin Milner]]'s initial published work on concurrency<ref>Robin Milner. Processes: A Mathematical Model of Computing Agents in Logic Colloquium 1973.</ref> was also notable in that it was not based on composing sequential processes. His work differed from the actor model because it was based on a fixed number of processes of fixed topology communicating numbers and strings using synchronous communication. The original [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP) model<ref>C.A.R. Hoare. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359585&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=19884966&CFTOKEN=55490895 Communicating sequential processes] CACM. August 1978.</ref> published by [[Tony Hoare]] differed from the actor model because<!-- redundant --> it was based on the parallel composition of a fixed number of sequential processes connected in a fixed topology, and communicating using synchronous message-passing based on process names (see [[Actor model and process calculi history#Early work|Actor model and process calculi history]]). Later versions of CSP abandoned communication based on process names in favor of anonymous communication via channels, an approach also used in Milner's work on the [[calculus of communicating systems]] and the [[\u03c0-calculus]].\n\nThese early models by Milner and Hoare both had the property of bounded nondeterminism. Modern, theoretical CSP ([Hoare 1985] and [Roscoe 2005]) explicitly provides unbounded nondeterminism.\n\n[[Petri nets]] and their extensions (e.g., coloured Petri nets) are like actors in that they are based on asynchronous message passing and unbounded nondeterminism, while they are like early CSP in that they define fixed topologies of elementary processing steps (transitions) and message repositories (places).\n\n==Influence==\nThe actor model has been influential on both theory development and practical software development.\n\n===Theory===\nThe actor model has influenced the development of the [[\u03c0-calculus]] and subsequent [[process calculi]]. In his Turing lecture, Robin Milner wrote:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Elements of interaction |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=36 |pages=78\u201389 |doi=10.1145/151233.151240 |year=1993 |last1=Milner |first1=Robin}}</ref>\n<blockquote>Now, the pure lambda-calculus is built with just two kinds of thing: terms and variables. Can we achieve the same economy for a process calculus? Carl Hewitt, with his actors model, responded to this challenge long ago; he declared that a value, an operator on values, and a process should all be the same kind of thing: an actor.\nThis goal impressed me, because it implies the homogeneity and completeness of expression ... But it was long before I could see how to attain the goal in terms of an algebraic calculus...\nSo, in the spirit of Hewitt, our first step is to demand that all things denoted by terms or accessed by names\u2014values, registers, operators, processes, objects\u2014are all of the same kind of thing; they should all be processes.</blockquote>\n\n===Practice===\nThe actor model has had extensive influence on commercial practice. For example, Twitter has used actors for scalability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waimingmok.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/how-twitter-is-scaling/ |title=How Twitter Is Scaling \u00ab Waiming Mok's Blog |publisher=Waimingmok.wordpress.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> Also, Microsoft has used the actor model in the development of its Asynchronous Agents Library.<ref>\"[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/623b6c0f-c229-4fcd-8a9d-a5ef24c60db9 Actor-Based Programming with the Asynchronous Agents Library]\" MSDN September 2010.</ref> There are many other actor libraries listed in the actor libraries and frameworks section below.\n\n==Addressed issues==\nAccording to Hewitt [2006], the actor model addresses issues in computer and communications architecture, [[concurrent programming language]]s, and [[Web service]]s including the following:\n* [[Scalability]]: the challenge of scaling up concurrency both locally and nonlocally.\n* [[Location transparency|Transparency]]: bridging the chasm between local and nonlocal concurrency. Transparency is currently a controversial issue. Some researchers {{Who|date=June 2010}} have advocated a strict separation between local concurrency using concurrent programming languages (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) from nonlocal concurrency using [[SOAP]] for [[Web service]]s. Strict separation produces a lack of transparency that causes problems when it is desirable/necessary to change between local and nonlocal access to Web services (see [[Distributed computing]]).\n* [[Inconsistency]]: inconsistency is the norm because all very large knowledge systems about human information system interactions are inconsistent. This inconsistency extends to the documentation and specifications of very large systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows software, etc.), which are internally inconsistent.\n\nMany of the ideas introduced in the actor model are now also finding application in [[multi-agent systems]] for these same reasons [Hewitt 2006b 2007b]. The key difference is that agent systems (in most definitions) impose extra constraints upon the actors, typically requiring that they make use of commitments and goals.\n\n== Programming with actors ==\nA number of different programming languages employ the actor model or some variation of it.

Actors may modify their own [[private state]], but can only affect each other indirectly through messaging (obviating [[Lock (computer science)|lock-based synchronization]]).\n\nThe actor model originated in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|ref={{harvid|Hewitt et al.|1973}} |last=Hewitt|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Hewitt|last2=Bishop|first2=Peter|last3=Steiger|first3=Richard|title=A Universal Modular Actor Formalism for Artificial Intelligence|publisher=IJCAI|year=1973}}</ref> It has been used both as a framework for a [[Actor model theory|theoretical understanding]] of [[Concurrency (computer science)|computation]] and as the theoretical basis for several [[Actor model implementation|practical implementations]] of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]].

This is similar to the ''everything is an object'' philosophy used by some [[object-oriented programming]] languages.\n\nAn actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:\n* send a finite number of messages to other actors;\n* create a finite number of new actors;\n* designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.\n\nThere is no assumed sequence to the above actions and they could be carried out in parallel.\n\nDecoupling the sender from communications sent was a fundamental advance of the actor model enabling [[asynchronous communication]] and control structures as patterns of [[message passing|passing messages]].<ref>Carl Hewitt. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA038246 Viewing Control Structures as Patterns of Passing Messages]'' Journal of Artificial Intelligence. June 1977.</ref>\n\nRecipients of messages are identified by address, sometimes called \"mailing address\". Thus an actor can only communicate with actors whose addresses it has. It can obtain those from a message it receives, or if the address is for an actor it has itself created.\n\nThe actor model is characterized by inherent concurrency of computation within and among actors, dynamic creation of actors, inclusion of actor addresses in messages, and interaction only through direct asynchronous [[message passing]] with no restriction on message arrival order.\n\n== Formal systems ==\nOver the years, several different formal systems have been developed which permit reasoning about systems in the actor model.

For example:\n\n* Electronic mail ([[email]]) can be modeled as an actor system. Accounts are modeled as actors and [[email address]]es as actor addresses.\n* [[Web service]]s can be modeled with Simple Object Access Protocol ([[SOAP]]) endpoints modeled as actor addresses.\n* Objects with [[Lock (computer science)|lock]]s (''e.g.'', as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) can be modeled as a ''serializer'', provided that their implementations are such that messages can continually arrive (perhaps by being stored in an internal [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]]). A serializer is an important kind of actor defined by the property that it is continually available to the arrival of new messages; every message sent to a serializer is guaranteed to arrive.\n* Testing and Test Control Notation ([[TTCN]]), both TTCN-2 and [[TTCN-3]], follows actor model rather closely. In TTCN actor is a test component: either parallel test component (PTC) or main test component (MTC). Test components can send and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer test components or test system interface), the latter being identified by its address. Each test component has a behaviour tree bound to it; test components run in parallel and can be dynamically created by parent test components. Built-in language constructs allow the definition of actions to be taken when an expected message is received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to another peer entity or creating new test components.\n\n==Message-passing semantics==\nThe actor model is about the semantics of [[message passing]].\n\n=== Unbounded nondeterminism controversy ===\nArguably, the first concurrent programs were [[interrupt handler]]s. During the course of its normal operation a computer needed to be able to receive information from outside (characters from a keyboard, packets from a network, ''etc''). So when the information arrived the execution of the computer was ''interrupted'' and special code (called an interrupt handler) was called to put the information in a [[data buffer]] where it could be subsequently retrieved.\n\nIn the early 1960s, interrupts began to be used to simulate the concurrent execution of several programs on one processor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |title=The Origins of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls |isbn=978-0-387-95401-1 |publisher=Springer |year=2002}}</ref> Having concurrency with [[shared memory]] gave rise to the problem of [[concurrency control]]. Originally, this problem was conceived as being one of [[mutual exclusion]] on a single computer. [[Edsger Dijkstra]] developed [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] and later, between 1971 and 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=1996 |title=Monitors and Concurrent Pascal: A Personal History |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=121\u2013172}}</ref> [[Tony Hoare]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoare |first=Tony |author-link=Tony Hoare |date=October 1974 |title=Monitors: An Operating System Structuring Concept |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=549\u2013557|doi=10.1145/355620.361161 }}</ref> and [[Per Brinch Hansen]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Per Brinch |author-link=Per Brinch Hansen |date=July 1973 |title=Operating System Principles |publisher=Prentice-Hall}}</ref> developed [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitors]] to solve the mutual exclusion problem. However, neither of these solutions provided a programming language construct that encapsulated access to shared resources. This encapsulation was later accomplished by the [[Serialization|serializer]] construct ([Hewitt and Atkinson 1977, 1979] and [Atkinson 1980]).\n\nThe first models of computation (''e.g.'', [[Turing machines]], Post productions, the [[lambda calculus]], ''etc.'') were based on mathematics and made use of a global state to represent a computational ''step'' (later generalized in [McCarthy and Hayes 1969] and [Dijkstra 1976] see [[Actor model early history#Event orderings versus global state|Event orderings versus global state]]). Each computational step was from one global state of the computation to the next global state. The global state approach was continued in [[automata theory]] for [[finite-state machine]]s and push down [[stack machine]]s, including their [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic]] versions. Such nondeterministic automata have the property of [[unbounded nondeterminism|bounded nondeterminism]]; that is, if a machine always halts when started in its initial state, then there is a bound on the number of states in which it halts.\n\n[[Edsger Dijkstra]] further developed the nondeterministic global state approach. Dijkstra's model gave rise to a controversy concerning [[unbounded nondeterminism]] (also called ''unbounded indeterminacy''), a property of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]] by which the amount of delay in servicing a request can become unbounded as a result of arbitration of contention for shared resources ''while still guaranteeing that the request will eventually be serviced''. Hewitt argued that the actor model should provide the guarantee of service. In Dijkstra's model, although there could be an unbounded amount of time between the execution of sequential instructions on a computer, a (parallel) program that started out in a well defined state could terminate in only a bounded number of states [Dijkstra 1976]. Consequently, his model could not provide the guarantee of service. Dijkstra argued that it was impossible to implement unbounded nondeterminism.\n\nHewitt argued otherwise: there is no bound that can be placed on how long it takes a computational circuit called an ''[[Arbiter (electronics)|arbiter]]'' to settle (see [[metastability (electronics)]]).<ref name=\"zenil\">{{cite book |last=Hewitt |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Hewitt |date=2012 |chapter=What is computation?

Turing on the 100th anniversary of his birth. |editor-last=Zenil |editor-first=Hector |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company}}</ref> Arbiters are used in computers to deal with the circumstance that computer clocks operate asynchronously with respect to input from outside, ''e.g.'', keyboard input, disk access, network input, ''etc.'' So it could take an unbounded time for a message sent to a computer to be received and in the meantime the computer could traverse an unbounded number of states.\n\nThe actor model features unbounded nondeterminism which was captured in a mathematical model by [[Will Clinger]] using [[domain theory]].<ref name=\"clinger1981\"/> In the actor model, there is no global state.{{dubious|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Direct communication and asynchrony===\nMessages in the actor model are not necessarily buffered. This was a sharp break with previous approaches to models of concurrent computation. The lack of buffering caused a great deal of misunderstanding at the time of the development of the actor model and is still a controversial issue. Some researchers argued that the messages are buffered in the \"ether\" or the \"environment\". Also, messages in the actor model are simply sent (like [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] in [[Internet Protocol|IP]]); there is no requirement for a synchronous handshake with the recipient.\n\n===Actor creation plus addresses in messages means variable topology===\nA natural development of the actor model was to allow addresses in messages. Influenced by [[Packet switching|packet switched networks]] [1961 and 1964], Hewitt proposed the development of a new model of concurrent computation in which communications would not have any required fields at all: they could be empty. Of course, if the sender of a communication desired a recipient to have access to addresses which the recipient did not already have, the address would have to be sent in the communication.\n\nFor example, an actor might need to send a message to a recipient actor from which it later expects to receive a response, but the response will actually be handled by a third actor component that has been configured to receive and handle the response (for example, a different actor implementing the [[observer pattern]]). The original actor could accomplish this by sending a communication that includes the message it wishes to send, along with the address of the third actor that will handle the response. This third actor that will handle the response is called the ''resumption'' (sometimes also called a [[continuation]] or [[stack frame]]). When the recipient actor is ready to send a response, it sends the response message to the ''resumption'' actor address that was included in the original communication.\n\nSo, the ability of actors to create new actors with which they can exchange communications, along with the ability to include the addresses of other actors in messages, gives actors the ability to create and participate in arbitrarily variable topological relationships with one another, much as the objects in Simula and other object-oriented languages may also be relationally composed into variable topologies of message-exchanging objects.\n\n===Inherently concurrent===\nAs opposed to the previous approach based on composing sequential processes, the actor model was developed as an inherently concurrent model. In the actor model sequentiality was a special case that derived from concurrent computation as explained in [[actor model theory]].\n\n===No requirement on order of message arrival===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nHewitt argued against adding the requirement that messages must arrive in the order in which they are sent to the actor. If output message ordering is desired, then it can be modeled by a queue actor that provides this functionality. Such a queue actor would queue the messages that arrived so that they could be retrieved in [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] order. So if an actor <tt>X</tt> sent a message <tt>M1</tt> to an actor <tt>Y</tt>, and later <tt>X</tt> sent another message <tt>M2</tt> to <tt>Y</tt>, there is no requirement that <tt>M1</tt> arrives at <tt>Y</tt> before <tt>M2</tt>.\n\nIn this respect the actor model mirrors [[packet switching]] systems which do not guarantee that packets must be received in the order sent. Not providing the order of delivery guarantee allows packet switching to buffer packets, use multiple paths to send packets, resend damaged packets, and to provide other optimizations.\n\nFor example, actors are allowed to pipeline the processing of messages. What this means is that in the course of processing a message <tt>M1</tt>, an actor can designate the behavior to be used to process the next message, and then in fact begin processing another message <tt>M2</tt> before it has finished processing <tt>M1</tt>. Just because an actor is allowed to pipeline the processing of messages does not mean that it ''must'' pipeline the processing. Whether a message is pipelined is an engineering tradeoff. How would an external observer know whether the processing of a message by an actor has been pipelined? There is no ambiguity in the definition of an actor created by the possibility of pipelining. Of course, it is possible to perform the pipeline optimization incorrectly in some implementations, in which case unexpected behavior may occur.\n\n===Locality===\nAnother important characteristic of the actor model is locality.\n\nLocality means that in processing a message, an actor can send messages only to addresses that it receives in the message, addresses that it already had before it received the message, and addresses for actors that it creates while processing the message. (But see [[#Synthesizing addresses of actors|Synthesizing addresses of actors]].)\n\nAlso locality means that there is no simultaneous change in multiple locations. In this way it differs from some other models of concurrency, ''e.g.'', the [[Petri net]] model in which tokens are simultaneously removed from multiple locations and placed in other locations.\n\n===Composing actor systems===\nThe idea of composing actor systems into larger ones is an important aspect of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] that was developed in Gul Agha's doctoral dissertation,<ref name=\"agha1986\"/> developed later by Gul Agha, Ian Mason, Scott Smith, and [[Carolyn Talcott]].<ref name=\"agha1993\"/>\n\n===Behaviors===\nA key innovation was the introduction of ''behavior'' specified as a mathematical function to express what an actor does when it processes a message, including specifying a new behavior to process the next message that arrives. Behaviors provided a mechanism to mathematically model the sharing in concurrency.\n\nBehaviors also freed the actor model from implementation details, ''e.g.'', the Smalltalk-72 token stream interpreter. However, it is critical to understand that the efficient implementation of systems described by the actor model require ''extensive'' optimization. See [[Actor model implementation]] for details.\n\n=== Modeling other concurrency systems ===\nOther concurrency systems (''e.g.'', [[process calculi]]) can be modeled in the actor model using a [[two-phase commit protocol]].<ref>Frederick Knabe. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick_Knabe/publication/2823488_A_Distributed_Protocol_for_Channel-Based_Communication_with_Choice/links/00463536b853ab72ef000000.pdf A Distributed Protocol for Channel-Based Communication with Choice PARLE 1992].</ref>\n\n=== Computational Representation Theorem ===\n{{see also|Denotational semantics of the Actor model}}\nThere is a ''Computational Representation Theorem'' in the actor model for systems which are closed in the sense that they do not receive communications from outside. The mathematical denotation denoted by a closed system <tt>S</tt> is constructed from an initial behavior <tt>\u22a5<sub>S</sub></tt> and a behavior-approximating function <tt>'''progression'''<sub>S</sub></tt>. These obtain increasingly better approximations and construct a denotation (meaning) for <tt>S</tt> as follows [Hewitt 2008; Clinger 1981]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{Denote}_{\\mathtt{S}} \\equiv \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{progression}_{\\mathtt{S}^i}(\\bot_\\mathtt{S})</math>\n\nIn this way, <tt>S</tt> can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its possible behaviors (including those involving unbounded nondeterminism). Although <tt>Denote<sub>S</sub></tt> is not an implementation of <tt>S</tt>, it can be used to prove a generalization of the Church-Turing-Rosser-Kleene thesis [Kleene 1943]:\n\nA consequence of the above theorem is that a finite actor can nondeterministically respond with an {{clarify span|uncountable|reason=Uncountability is the property of real numbers, this sounds like (countably) infinite was meant|date=November 2013}} number of different outputs.\n\n===Relationship to logic programming===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nOne of the key motivations for the development of the actor model was to understand and deal with the control structure issues that arose in development of the [[Planner programming language]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Once the actor model was initially defined, an important challenge was to understand the power of the model relative to [[Robert Kowalski]]'s thesis that \"computation can be subsumed by deduction\". Hewitt argued that Kowalski's thesis turned out to be false for the concurrent computation in the actor model (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]).\n\nNevertheless, attempts were made to extend [[logic programming]] to concurrent computation. However, Hewitt and Agha [1991] claimed that the resulting systems were not deductive in the following sense: computational steps of the concurrent logic programming systems do not follow deductively from previous steps (see [[Indeterminacy in concurrent computation]]). Recently, logic programming has been integrated into the actor model in a way that maintains logical semantics.<ref name=\"zenil\"/>\n\n===Migration===\nMigration in the actor model is the ability of actors to change locations. ''E.g.'', in his dissertation, Aki Yonezawa modeled a post office that customer actors could enter, change locations within while operating, and exit. An actor that can migrate can be modeled by having a location actor that changes when the actor migrates. However the faithfulness of this modeling is controversial and the subject of research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Security===\nThe security of actors can be protected in the following ways:\n* [[Hardwired control|hardwiring]] in which actors are physically connected\n* [[computer hardware]] as in [[Burroughs B5000]], [[Lisp machine]], ''etc.''\n* [[virtual machines]] as in [[Java virtual machine]], [[Common Language Runtime]], ''etc.''\n* [[operating systems]] as in [[capability-based security|capability-based systems]]\n* [[Digital signature|signing]] and/or [[encryption]] of actors and their addresses\n\n===Synthesizing addresses of actors===\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2012}}\nA delicate point in the actor model is the ability to synthesize the address of an actor. In some cases security can be used to prevent the synthesis of addresses (see [[#Security|Security]]). However, if an actor address is simply a bit string then clearly it can be synthesized although it may be difficult or even infeasible to guess the address of an actor if the bit strings are long enough. [[SOAP]] uses a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] for the address of an endpoint where an actor can be reached. Since a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] is a character string, it can clearly be synthesized although encryption can make it virtually impossible to guess.\n\nSynthesizing the addresses of actors is usually modeled using mapping. The idea is to use an actor system to perform the mapping to the actual actor addresses. For example, on a computer the memory structure of the computer can be modeled as an actor system that does the mapping. In the case of [[SOAP]] addresses, it's modeling the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] and the rest of the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] mapping.\n\n===Contrast with other models of message-passing concurrency===\n[[Robin Milner]]'s initial published work on concurrency<ref>Robin Milner. Processes: A Mathematical Model of Computing Agents in Logic Colloquium 1973.</ref> was also notable in that it was not based on composing sequential processes. His work differed from the actor model because it was based on a fixed number of processes of fixed topology communicating numbers and strings using synchronous communication. The original [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP) model<ref>C.A.R. Hoare. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359585&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=19884966&CFTOKEN=55490895 Communicating sequential processes] CACM. August 1978.</ref> published by [[Tony Hoare]] differed from the actor model because<!-- redundant --> it was based on the parallel composition of a fixed number of sequential processes connected in a fixed topology, and communicating using synchronous message-passing based on process names (see [[Actor model and process calculi history#Early work|Actor model and process calculi history]]). Later versions of CSP abandoned communication based on process names in favor of anonymous communication via channels, an approach also used in Milner's work on the [[calculus of communicating systems]] and the [[\u03c0-calculus]].\n\nThese early models by Milner and Hoare both had the property of bounded nondeterminism. Modern, theoretical CSP ([Hoare 1985] and [Roscoe 2005]) explicitly provides unbounded nondeterminism.\n\n[[Petri nets]] and their extensions (e.g., coloured Petri nets) are like actors in that they are based on asynchronous message passing and unbounded nondeterminism, while they are like early CSP in that they define fixed topologies of elementary processing steps (transitions) and message repositories (places).\n\n==Influence==\nThe actor model has been influential on both theory development and practical software development.\n\n===Theory===\nThe actor model has influenced the development of the [[\u03c0-calculus]] and subsequent [[process calculi]]. In his Turing lecture, Robin Milner wrote:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Elements of interaction |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=36 |pages=78\u201389 |doi=10.1145/151233.151240 |year=1993 |last1=Milner |first1=Robin}}</ref>\n<blockquote>Now, the pure lambda-calculus is built with just two kinds of thing: terms and variables. Can we achieve the same economy for a process calculus? Carl Hewitt, with his actors model, responded to this challenge long ago; he declared that a value, an operator on values, and a process should all be the same kind of thing: an actor.\nThis goal impressed me, because it implies the homogeneity and completeness of expression ... But it was long before I could see how to attain the goal in terms of an algebraic calculus...\nSo, in the spirit of Hewitt, our first step is to demand that all things denoted by terms or accessed by names\u2014values, registers, operators, processes, objects\u2014are all of the same kind of thing; they should all be processes.</blockquote>\n\n===Practice===\nThe actor model has had extensive influence on commercial practice. For example, Twitter has used actors for scalability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waimingmok.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/how-twitter-is-scaling/ |title=How Twitter Is Scaling \u00ab Waiming Mok's Blog |publisher=Waimingmok.wordpress.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> Also, Microsoft has used the actor model in the development of its Asynchronous Agents Library.<ref>\"[https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/623b6c0f-c229-4fcd-8a9d-a5ef24c60db9 Actor-Based Programming with the Asynchronous Agents Library]\" MSDN September 2010.</ref> There are many other actor libraries listed in the actor libraries and frameworks section below.\n\n==Addressed issues==\nAccording to Hewitt [2006], the actor model addresses issues in computer and communications architecture, [[concurrent programming language]]s, and [[Web service]]s including the following:\n* [[Scalability]]: the challenge of scaling up concurrency both locally and nonlocally.\n* [[Location transparency|Transparency]]: bridging the chasm between local and nonlocal concurrency. Transparency is currently a controversial issue. Some researchers {{Who|date=June 2010}} have advocated a strict separation between local concurrency using concurrent programming languages (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) from nonlocal concurrency using [[SOAP]] for [[Web service]]s. Strict separation produces a lack of transparency that causes problems when it is desirable/necessary to change between local and nonlocal access to Web services (see [[Distributed computing]]).\n* [[Inconsistency]]: inconsistency is the norm because all very large knowledge systems about human information system interactions are inconsistent. This inconsistency extends to the documentation and specifications of very large systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows software, etc.), which are internally inconsistent.\n\nMany of the ideas introduced in the actor model are now also finding application in [[multi-agent systems]] for these same reasons [Hewitt 2006b 2007b]. The key difference is that agent systems (in most definitions) impose extra constraints upon the actors, typically requiring that they make use of commitments and goals.\n\n== Programming with actors ==\nA number of different programming languages employ the actor model or some variation of it.

Newcastle marched out of York on 6 December, and split his force of 6,000 into two; he took 4,000 infantry down the main York\u2013Tadcaster road to attack the town from the east, while sending a deputy, the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]], with a further 1,500 to circle around and trap the Parliamentarians by attacking from the north-west.\n\nNewcastle's infantry engaged the town on the morning of 7 December, but after some initial minor incursions, the battle settled into an exchange of [[musket]] fire. Newport's detachment never joined the battle. Fairfax was nevertheless forced to retreat overnight, as he was running short of gunpowder, and Newcastle occupied the town the following day.

After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced into Yorkshire with around 8,000 men, defeating the Parliamentarians at the [[Battle of Piercebridge]], and established himself in [[York]] on 3 December.{{sfn|Hulse|2011}} Lord Fairfax had himself been leading a Parliamentarian army towards York, but when he received news of the Royalist victory at Piercebridge he stopped at [[Tadcaster]], around {{convert|10|miles}} south-west of York.

In the mean time, Fairfax had been preparing Tadcaster's defences: he built a [[redoubt]] atop a hill by the [[River Wharfe]] overlooking the York road, and drew in additional troops, gathering between 900 and 1,500 soldiers in the town.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} In the face of the large Royalist army, Fairfax and his commanders held a [[council of war]], and decided to withdraw from the town the next morning, 7 December.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}} However, by the time they had gathered their men to leave, fighting had broken out on the edge of town.

Both sides settled into their positions, and exchanged [[musket]] fire for the rest of the day. The planned second prong of Newcastle's attack, under Newport's command, never arrived. The historian David Cooke suggests that it was most likely due to his artillery slowing him down on the poor winter roads. The 18th-century historian [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]] claimed that one of the Parliamentarian officers, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], forged a letter to Newport, purporting to be from Newcastle, ordering him to halt.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe Parliamentarians, despite holding a defensible position, were running short of gunpowder, and decided to withdraw from the town overnight.

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Air Canada]] purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for US$30&nbsp;million for 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Current History== \n[[File:PATH Escalators Construction Scotiabank Arena.jpg|thumb|right|Escalators for a new [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] system connection to the under-construction [[CIBC Square]] office complex being installed in the arena's lobby in 2019]]\nIn 2003, MLSE completed a $5-million upgrade of the arena, including a new LED signage system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=459588|title=Air Canada Centre Renovations to Improve Ultimate Fan Experience|date=September 9, 2003|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]}}</ref>  During the summer of 2015, a $10-million upgrade of the arena was carried out, which included the installation of a new scoreboard four times larger than the previous one.

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financial difficulties, the building's ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993 and remained abandoned.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

There is also an east\u2013west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.
