However, in 1947 he was appointed to the position of the general service registrar (archivist) of the Franciscan Order (OFM) in Rome, a position which he held up to 1985. In the function of archivist he participated in international conferences in Paris, Moscow, Florence, etc. and co-operated in the publications of their journals. He was also elected to administrative positions in professional associations. In his book Archivistica ecclesiastica which was published by the Vatican's archives in 1967, he summarized his experiences as an archivist. His entire professional life was dedicated to research in the various Vatican archives. He published twenty-one scientific books and the three books of memoirs, a large number of scholarly papers, and hundreds of magazine articles. He wrote mainly in [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], and occasionally in English, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

At the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, it was merged with the American [[Manhattan Project]]. The [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project]] saw British scientists participate in most of its work. The British government considered nuclear weapons to be a joint discovery, but the American [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act) restricted other countries, including the UK, from access to information about nuclear weapons. Fearing the loss of Britain's [[great power]] status, the UK resumed its own project, now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]]. On 3 October 1952, it detonated an atomic bomb in the [[Monte Bello Islands]] of [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]]. Eleven more British [[nuclear weapons tests in Australia]] were carried out over the following decade, including seven [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga]] in 1956 and 1957.\n\nThe [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] demonstrated Britain's ability to produce [[thermonuclear weapon]]s in the [[Operation Grapple]] nuclear tests in the Pacific, and led to the amendment of the McMahon Act. Since the [[1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement]], the US and the UK have cooperated extensively on nuclear security matters. The nuclear [[Special Relationship]] between the two countries has involved the exchange of [[classified information|classified]] scientific data and [[fissile material]]s such as [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium]]. The UK has not had a programme to develop an independent delivery system since the cancellation of the [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] in 1960. Instead, it has purchased US delivery systems for UK use, fitting them with warheads designed and manufactured by the UK's [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE) and its predecessor. Under the 1963 [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], the US supplied the UK with [[Polaris missile]]s and [[nuclear submarine]] technology. The US also supplied the RAF and [[British Army of the Rhine]] with nuclear weapons under [[Project E]] until 1992. Nuclear-capable American aircraft have been based in the UK since 1949, but the last US nuclear weapons were withdrawn in 2006. I love vandalsim.\n\nIn 1982, the Polaris Sales Agreement was amended to allow the UK to purchase [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] missiles. Since 1998, when the UK decommissioned its tactical [[WE.177]] bombs, the [[Trident (UK nuclear programme)|Trident]] has been the only operational nuclear weapons system in British service. The delivery system consists of four {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine}}s based at [[HMNB Clyde]] in Scotland. Each submarine is armed with up to sixteen [[Trident missile|Trident II missiles]], each carrying warheads in up to eight [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle]]s (MIRVs). With at least one submarine always on patrol, the ''Vanguards'' perform a [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] role and also have a [[tactical nuclear weapon|sub-strategic]] capability.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of nuclear weapons}}\n\n===Tube Alloys===\n{{main|MAUD Committee|Tube Alloys}}\n[[File:Poynting Physics building 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[John Henry Poynting|Poynting]] Physics building at the [[University of Birmingham]], where Peierls and Frisch wrote the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] ]]\nThe [[neutron]] was discovered by [[James Chadwick]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in February 1932,{{sfn|Clark|1961|p=9}} and in April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] split [[lithium]] atoms with accelerated [[proton]]s.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=17\u201318}} In December 1938, [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] at Hahn's laboratory in [[Berlin-Dahlem]] bombarded [[uranium]] with slow neutrons,{{sfn|Clark|1961|p=5}} and discovered that [[barium]] had been produced.{{sfn|Clark|1961|p=11}} Hahn wrote to his colleague [[Lise Meitner]], who, with her nephew [[Otto Frisch]], determined that the uranium [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] had been split, a conclusion they published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1939.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|p=240}} By analogy with the [[Fission (biology)|division of biological cells]], they named the process \"[[nuclear fission|fission]]\".{{sfn|Zimmerman|1995|p=262}}\n\nThe discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful [[atomic bomb]] could be created.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=23\u201329}} The term was already familiar to the British public through the writings of [[H. G. Wells]], with a continuously-exploding bomb in his 1913 novel ''[[The World Set Free]]''.{{sfn|Farmelo|2013|pp=15\u201324}} [[George Paget Thomson]], at [[Imperial College London]], and [[Mark Oliphant]], an Australian physicist at the [[University of Birmingham]], were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=37\u201339}} Oliphant delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, [[Rudolf Peierls]] and Frisch, who ironically could not work on the university's secret projects like [[radar]] because they were [[enemy alien]]s and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance.{{sfn|Szasz|1992|pp=3\u20135}} In March 1940 they calculated the [[critical mass]] of a metallic sphere of pure [[uranium-235]], and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as {{convert|1|to|10|kg}} would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=39\u201341}}{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|pp=440\u2013446}}\n\nOliphant took the resulting [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] to Sir [[Henry Tizard]], the chairman of the [[Tizard Committee]],{{sfn|Clark|1961|pp=54\u201356}} and the [[MAUD Committee]] was established to investigate further.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=39\u201340}} It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain.{{sfn|Phelps|2010|pp=282\u2013283}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=42}} A new directorate known as [[Tube Alloys]] was created to coordinate this effort. Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], the [[Lord President of the Council]], became the minister responsible, and [[Wallace Akers]] from [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=108\u2013111}}\n\n===Manhattan Project===\n{{Main|British contribution to the Manhattan Project}}\nIn July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research,{{sfn|Phelps|2010|pp=126\u2013128}} and the [[Tizard Mission]]'s John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1995|pp=266\u2013267}} He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the [[Manhattan Project]]) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.{{sfn|Phelps|2010|pp=282\u2013283}} The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project.{{sfn|Bernstein|1976|pp=206\u2013207}} In November 1941, [[Frederick L. Hovde]], the head of the London liaison office of the American [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and [[Lord Cherwell]], who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by [[atomic spies]] for the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Paul|2000|p=26}}\n\n[[File:Groves and Chadwick 830308.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Chadwick]] (left), the head of the British Mission, confers with [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]] (right), the director of the [[Manhattan Project]]|alt=A large man in uniform and a bespectacled thin man in a suit and tie sit at a desk.]]\nThe United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it.{{sfn|Bernstein|1976|pp=206\u2013208}} On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised  the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], that: \"We must face the fact that&nbsp;... [our] pioneering work&nbsp;... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.\"{{sfn|Bernstein|1976|p=208}}\n\nThe British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]]. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to secure American cooperation.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=162\u2013165}} At the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, Churchill and the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], signed the [[Quebec Agreement]], which merged the two national projects.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=277}} The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] and the [[Combined Development Trust]] to coordinate their efforts, and specified that the weapons could only be used if both the USA and UK governments agreed.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285\u2013286}} The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=340\u2013342}}\n\nA British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of [[gaseous diffusion]] technology at the [[SAM Laboratories]] in New York.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=250\u2013256}} Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]], assisted with the [[electromagnetic separation]] process.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=226\u2013227, 256\u2013258}} Cockcroft became the director of the Anglo-Canadian [[Montreal Laboratory]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=246\u2013247}} The British mission to the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] was headed by Chadwick, and later Peierls. It included distinguished scientists such as [[G. I. Taylor|Geoffrey Taylor]], [[James L. Tuck|James Tuck]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[William George Penney|William Penney]], Frisch, [[Ernest Titterton]] and [[Klaus Fuchs]], who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy.{{sfn|Szasz|1992|pp=148\u2013151}}{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=260\u2013268}} As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R.

When Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}}\n\nOn 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed replaced the Quebec Agreement. It made Canada a full partner, continued the Combined Policy Committee and Combined Development Trust, and reduced the obligation to obtain consent for the use of nuclear weapons to merely requiring consultation.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}} The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} the Americans restricted  cooperation to basic scientific research.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}\n\nThe next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee.

While the [[Joe 1|first Soviet atomic bomb test]] in August 1949 was embarrassing to the British (who had not expected a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, it was for the Americans another reason for cooperation. Although they would soon have their own nuclear capability, the British proposed that instead of building their own uranium-enrichment plant they would send most of their scientists to work in the US, and swap plutonium from Windscale for enriched uranium from the US.

Only \"the threat of large-scale damage from similar weapons\" could prevent the Soviet Union from using atomic weapons in a war.{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=48, 397\u2013398}}\n\n[[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[John Slessor]], who became Chief of the Air Staff in 1950, wrote that year that the Soviet superiority in European forces was so great that even \"an ultimatum by Russia within the next two to three years\" might cause Western Europe to surrender without a war. He feared that the United Kingdom might also do so \"unless we can make ourselves far less defenceless than we are now.\" By 1952 the [[Air Ministry]] had abandoned the concept of a conventional defence of Western Europe.{{sfn|Ball|1995|pp=71, 78\u201379}} The hydrogen bomb increased the threat to Britain. In 1957, a government study stated that although RAF fighters would \"unquestionably be able to take a heavy toll of enemy bombers, a proportion would inevitably get through. Even if it were only a dozen, they could with megaton bombs inflict widespread devastation.\" Although disarmament remained a British goal, \"the only existing safeguard against major aggression is the power to threaten retaliation with nuclear weapons.\"{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\nChurchill stated in a 1955 speech that deterrence would be \"the parents of disarmament\" and that, unless Britain contributed to Western deterrence with its own weapons, during a war the targets that threatened it the most might not be prioritised. The Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], advanced the position that nuclear weapons would give Britain influence over targeting and American policy, and would affect strategy in the Middle East and Far East. His [[Secretary of State for Defence|Minister of Defence]], [[Duncan Sandys]], considered that nuclear weapons reduced Britain's dependence on the United States.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=248}} The 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] demonstrated that Britain was no longer a great power,{{sfn|Bowie|Platt|1984|p=43}} but increased the value to Britain of an independent nuclear deterrent that would give it greater influence with the US and USSR.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|p=141}} While the military target of British nuclear weapons was the Soviet Union, the political target was the United States.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=28}}\n[[File:100 years of the RAF MOD 45163623.jpg|thumb|left|[[Avro Vulcan]] bombers]]\nIndependent targeting was vital. The Chiefs of Staff believed that\u2014contrary to Tizard's view\u2014once the Soviet Union became able to attack the United States itself with nuclear weapons in the late 1950s, America might not risk its own cities to defend Europe, or not emphasise targets that endangered the United Kingdom more than the United States:{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=185\u2013187}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985\u20131986|pp=81\u201384}}\n{{quote|When New York is vulnerable to attack the United States will not use her strategic weapon in defence of London.

Part of the perceived effectiveness of an independent deterrent was the willingness to target enemy cities. Slessor saw atomic weapons as a way to avoid a third devastating world war given that the two previous ones had begun without them. While he sought to de-emphasise city targeting in British plans as Air Chief,{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=110\u2013114}} Slessor wrote in 1954 after retirement:{{quote|And if [war] is forced upon us, we must be able to instantly deliver a crushing counter-attack upon aggression at its source\u2014not merely at its airfields, its launching sites and submarine bases, at its armies in the field but at the heart of the aggressor country.

It was therefore impossible to store British and Americans bombs together in the same SSA.{{sfn|Bronk|2014|pp=978\u2013980}} US custody also created operational problems. The procedure for handing over the bombs added an extra ten minutes to the bombers' reaction time,{{sfn|Bronk|2014|p=985}} and the requirement that US personnel had guardianship of the weapons at all times meant that neither they nor the bombers could be relocated to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|pp=262\u2013263}} The operational restrictions imposed by Project E \"effectively handed the US government a veto over the use of half of Britain's nuclear deterrent\".{{sfn|Young|2007|p=994}}\n\nThe Air Council decided on 7 July 1960 that Project E weapons would be phased out by December 1962, by which time it was anticipated that there would be sufficient British megaton weapons to equip the entire [[strategic bomber]] force.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|pp=266\u2013267}} Project E weapons were replaced by British [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|Yellow Sun]] bombs.{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=114, 210}} Problems encountered in the development [[Red Beard]] bomb meant that the replacement of kiloton weapons took longer.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=213\u2013214}} The Air Ministry decided to replace the Canberras with Valiants as the long-range Vulcan and Victor V bombers became available. A Valiant squadron at [[RAF Marham]] was assigned to SACEUR on 1 January 1961, followed by two more in July. The UK-based Canberra squadrons were then disbanded. Each of the 24 Valiants was equipped with two Project E [[B28 nuclear bomb|Mark 28 nuclear bombs]].{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=98\u201399}} These were replaced by the newer [[B43 nuclear bomb|Mark 43 nuclear bombs]] in early 1963.{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=98\u201399}} The Valiants were withdrawn from service in 1965.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|pp=371\u2013372}}\n\nProject E nuclear warheads were also used on the sixty [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] [[Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile]]s (IRBMs) that were operated by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the RAF's bombers and Thor missiles targeted 16 cities, 44 airfields, 10 air defence control centres and 20 IRBM sites.{{sfn|Baylis|Stoddart|2015|p=221}} The RAF high command never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them secondary to the V bomber force.

Providing American atomic bombs for Royal Navy ships would have involved similar dual key arrangements and detachments of [[US Marines]] on board Royal Navy ships, which was deemed impractical even for ships and weapons dedicated to use in European waters. However, RAF [[Coastal Command]]  acquired [[Mk 101 Lulu]] [[nuclear depth bomb]]s (with the [[W34 (nuclear warhead)|W34 nuclear warhead]]) for its [[Avro Shackleton]] and [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]] maritime patrol aircraft from 1965 to 1971 under Project N.{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=221\u2013222}}{{sfn|Stoddart|2012|pp=220, 314}} These were later replaced by the more capable [[B57 nuclear bomb|Mark 57]], which was stockpiled at [[RAF St Mawgan]] and [[RAF Machrihanish]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/nep5text.htm |title=Nuclear Warships and Naval Nuclear Weapons 1990: A Complete Inventory |first=Joshua |last=Handler |first2=William M. |last2=Arkin |publisher=Greenpeace International |access-date=5 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1991, the BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155&nbsp;mm nuclear artillery shells.

The first of these was the Mark 28, which was \"Anglicised\" and manufactured in the UK as [[Red Snow]]. Exact copies of American designs were not pursued; the high explosive used in American warheads were more sensitive than British high explosive, and had caused fatal accidents in the US. Its use was not contemplated in the UK after an accident at Aldermaston on 28 February 1959 when two men were killed after a piece of British high explosive fell from a lorry. British high explosive was also bulkier, so a redesign was required.{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nRed Snow was far more economical in its use of fissile material than the Green Grass warhead in the Yellow Sun Mk.1 bomb, Britain's first production hydrogen bomb. A Yellow Sun Mk.2 with Red Snow, therefore, cost \u00a3500,000 compared to \u00a31.2 million for the Mk.1. RAF Bomber Command wanted Violet Club replaced as soon as possible, so 37 Yellow Sun Mk.1s were delivered by the end of 1959. Deliveries of the Yellow Sun Mk.2 commenced in January 1961, and 43 were delivered by the end of the year. In November 1958.

The British wanted to use Red Snow, partly for safety reasons and partly because it was not certain that the advanced M47 design would be made available without strings attached. The technical problem was that Red Snow was {{convert|1000|lb}} heavier, and therefore the range of the Skybolt would be reduced from {{convert|1000|to|650|mi}}. A megaton design known as RE.179 based on the [[W49]] warhead used in American ICBMs was developed for Skybolt.{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=118\u2013120}}<ref name=\"weapons.info\" />\n\nAt the same time, work was in progress on a Red Beard replacement for use with the RAF's [[BAC TSR-2]] and the Royal Navy's [[Blackburn Buccaneer]].

Even small number of [[Convair B-36 Peacemaker]] bombers could not make it there and back. Overseas bases were therefore required, and the need for bases in the UK was a feature of American war planning for over a decade.{{sfn|Young|2007|pp=118\u2013119}}\n\n[[File:F-15E Strike Eagle.jpg|thumb|right|USAF F-15E of [[494th Fighter Squadron]] stationed at [[RAF Lakenheath]] ]]\nObtaining British permission was easy thanks to the wartime comradeship between the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Bypassing the politicians, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Carl Spaatz]], the commander of the USAAF, came to an agreement with the Chief Of the Air Staff, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Tedder, in June and July 1946. Work began on extended and strengtheners runways at RAF airbases in East Anglia to receive the B-29s. In June 1947, nine B-29s of the [[97th Bombardment Group]] deployed to RAF Marham, where they were greeted by Tedder.{{sfn|Young|2007|pp=120\u2013122}} This was merely a test; the bombers were not nuclear-capable.

It assumed a conventional war in Europe lasting two to three days, during which the UK would be attacked with conventional weapons, then a limited nuclear exchange, with 54 nuclear warheads used against military targets in the UK. 250,000 people protested against the exercise and 24 councils refused to participate. The limited scenario still assumed casualties of 7.9 million dead and 5 million injured.{{sfn|Campbell|1982|pp=53\u201354}} The scenario was ridiculed by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and the exercise was postponed indefinitely.{{sfn|Wittner|2003|p=294}} The ''[[New Statesman]]'' later claimed the Ministry of Defence insisted on having a veto over proposed targets in the exercise and several were removed to make them politically more acceptable; for example, the nuclear submarine base at Faslane was removed from the target list.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hard Rock is cancelled again|newspaper=New Statesman|date=11 March 1983|page=6}}</ref>\n\n===Civil defence===\n\n{{Main|Civil defence|Protect and Survive}}\nSuccessive governments developed [[civil defence]] programmes aimed to prepare civilian and local government infrastructure for a nuclear strike on the UK.

Many different groups and individuals have been involved in [[anti-nuclear protests|anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests]] over the years. One of the most prominent anti-nuclear groups in the UK is the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). This national movement was founded in the late 1950s, initially in opposition to nuclear testing. It reached its peak around 1960, by which time it had evolved into a broader movement calling for Britain to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons, withdraw from NATO, and end the basing of US bombers armed with nuclear weapons in the UK.{{sfn|Bowie|Platt|1984|pp=63\u201370}}\n\nThe end of atmospheric nuclear testing, internal squabbles, and activists focusing their energies on other causes led to a rapid decline, but it revived in the early 1980s in the wake of the Thatcher government's December 1979 decision to deploy US GLCMs in the UK, and the announcement of its decision to purchase Trident in July 1980. Membership leapt from 3,000 in 1980 to 50,000 a year later, and rallies for unilateral nuclear disarmament in London in October 1981 and June 1982 attracted 250,000 marchers, the largest ever mass demonstrations in the UK up to that time.{{sfn|Bowie|Platt|1984|pp=63\u201370}}\n\n==End of cross-party support==\n\nThere was little dissent in the House of Commons from the government's nuclear weapons policy; it had almost bipartisan support until 1960, with only the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] temporarily dissenting in 1958. Despite opposition from its left wing the Labour party supported British nuclear weapons but opposed tests, and Labour Opposition Leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and shadow foreign secretary [[Aneurin Bevan]] agreed with Sandys on the importance of reducing dependence on the American deterrent. Bevan told his colleagues that their demand for [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] would send a future Labour government \"naked into the conference chamber\" during international negotiations.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|p=145}}\n\n[[File:Jeremy Corbyn Says -StopTrident - 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]] speaks at the #StopTrident rally at [[Trafalgar Square]] on 27 February 2016]]\nThe ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and other newspapers critical of the Conservative government supported the British deterrent, although the ''Guardian'' did criticise the government for relying on developing bombers rather than missiles to carry the weapons.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=65}} In 1962 it stated that the forthcoming [[Chinese nuclear weapon]] was a reason for having more than one Western nuclear nation. From 1955 the government chose to emphasize the nuclear deterrent and de-emphasize conventional forces.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|p=140}} ''[[The Economist]]'', the ''[[New Statesman]]'', and many left-wing newspapers supported the reliance on nuclear deterrence and nuclear weapons, but in their view considered that of the United States would suffice, and that of the costs of the \"nuclear umbrella\" was best left to be borne by the United States alone.{{sfn|Groom|1974|pp=131\u2013154}}\n\nGaitskell's Labour party ceased supporting an independent deterrent in 1960 via its new \"Policy for Peace\", after the cancellation of Blue Streak made nuclear independence less likely. Labour also adopted a resolution favouring unilateral disarmament. Although Gaitskell opposed the resolution and it was reversed in 1961 in favor of continuing support of a general Western nuclear deterrent, the party's opposition to a British deterrent remained and became more prominent.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|pp=146\u2013156}}\n\nThis became a campaign issue during the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. [[Alec Douglas-Home]]'s incumbent Conservatives stated that the British deterrent was both necessary for independence from the Americans and maintaining British world influence, and was \"working for peace\" in such cases as the passage of the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Led by Gaitskell's successor [[Harold Wilson]], Labour emphasized domestic economic issues but called deterrence the \"Tory Nuclear Pretense\" which would be neither independent nor effective. The populace's greater interest in domestic over foreign policy likely contributed to Labour's victory.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|pp=146\u2013156}}\n\nThe 1982 [[Labour Party Conference]] adopted a platform calling for the removal of the GLCMs, the scrapping of Polaris and the cancellation of Trident. This was reaffirmed by the 1986 conference. While the party was given little chance of winning the 1983 election in the aftermath of the Falklands War, polls had shown Labour ahead of the Conservatives in 1986 and 1987. In the wake of Labour's unsuccessful performance in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election]], the Labour Party leader, [[Neil Kinnock]], despite his own unilateralist convictions, moved to drop the party's disarmament policy, which he saw as a contributing factor in its defeat.{{sfn|Scott|2012|pp=116\u2013118}}<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge83.shtml |title=Politics 97 |access-date=13 July 2018}}</ref> The party formally voted to do so in October 1989.{{sfn|Chalmers|1999|p=62}}\n\nPro-independence Scottish political parties\u2014the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), [[Scottish Green Party]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP) and [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]]\u2014are opposed to the basing of the Trident system close to Glasgow, Scotland's largest city.{{sfn|Ritchie|2016|pp=658\u2013659}} Some members and ex-members of those parties, such as [[Tommy Sheridan]] and [[Lloyd Quinan]], have taken part in blockades of the base.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Telegraph |title=Sheridan held again in Faslane protest |first=Tara |last=Womersley |date=23 October 2001 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1360222/Sheridan-held-again-in-Faslane-protest.html |access-date=5 May 2018 }}</ref> In the House of Commons vote in 2007, the majority of Scottish members of parliament (MPs) voted against upgrading the system, while a substantial majority of English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs voted in favour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6452275.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Scots Labour MPs rebel on Trident|date=14 March 2007|access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear posture==\nThe UK has relaxed its nuclear posture since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] made reductions from the plans announced by the previous [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government:\n*The stockpile of \"operationally available warheads\" was reduced from 300 to \"less than 200\"\n*The final batch of missile bodies would not be purchased, limiting the fleet to 58.\n*A submarine's load of warheads was reduced from 96 to 48. This reduced the explosive power of the warheads on a Vanguard class Trident submarine to \"one third less than a Polaris submarine armed with Chevaline\". However, 48 warheads per Trident submarine represents a 50% increase on the 32 warheads per submarine of Chevaline. Total explosive power has been in decline for decades as the accuracy of missiles has improved, therefore requiring less power to destroy each target. Trident can destroy 48 targets per submarine, as opposed to 32 targets that could be destroyed by Chevaline.\n*Submarines' missiles would not be targeted, but rather at several days \"notice to fire\".\n*Although one submarine would always be on patrol it will operate on a \"reduced day-to-day alert state\". A major factor in maintaining a constant patrol is to avoid \"misunderstanding or escalation if a Trident submarine were to sail during a period of crisis\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E50E/0/sdr1998_complete.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121018172816/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E50E/0/sdr1998_complete.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-18 |publisher=UK National Archive |access-date=2 August 2018 |title=Strategic Defence Review |date=July 1998 }}</ref>\n\nCurrent UK posture is as it has been for many years; Trident SLBMs still provide the long-range strategic element.

The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review further pledged to reduce its requirement for operationally available warheads from fewer than 160 to no more than 120.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/62482/strategic-defence-security-review.pdf|title=Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The Strategic Defence and Security Review|last=HM Government|date=October 2010|publisher=UK government|p=38}}</ref> In a January 2015 written statement, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon reported that \"all Vanguard Class SSBNs on continuous at-sea deterrent patrol now carry 40 nuclear warheads and no more than eight operational missiles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-01-20/HCWS210/|title=Nuclear Deterrent:Written statement \u2013 HCWS210|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref> In April 2017 Defence Secretary [[Michael Fallon]] confirmed that the UK would use nuclear weapons in a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] under \"the most extreme circumstances\".<ref name=independent-20170424>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nuclear-weapons-first-strike-michael-fallon-general-election-jeremy-corbyn-trident-a7698621.html |title=Theresa May would fire UK's nuclear weapons as a 'first strike', says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon |first=Rob |last=Merrick |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 April 2017 |accessdate=24 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear weapons control==\n[[File:WE.177 safety keys.jpg|thumb|right|WE.177 safety and arming keys]]\nThe precise details of how a British Prime Minister would authorise a nuclear strike remain secret, although the principles of the Trident missile control system is believed to be based on the plan set up for Polaris in 1968, which has now been declassified. A closed-circuit television system was set up between 10 Downing Street and the SSBN Control Officer at the [[Northwood Headquarters]] of the Royal Navy. Both the Prime Minister and the SSBN Control Officer would be able to see each other on their monitors when the command was given. If the link failed \u2013 for instance during a nuclear attack or when the PM was away from Downing Street \u2013 the Prime Minister would send an authentication code which could be verified at Northwood. The PM would then broadcast a firing order to the SSBN submarines via the Very Low Frequency radio station at Rugby. The UK has not deployed control equipment requiring codes to be sent before weapons can be used, such as the U.S. [[Permissive Action Link]], which if installed would preclude the possibility that military officers could launch British nuclear weapons without authorisation.<ref name=\"MoD statement\" /><ref name=\"British nuclear weapon control\" /><ref name=\"BBC press release\" />\n\nUntil 1998, when it was withdrawn from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard [[tubular pin tumbler lock]] (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard [[allen key]] was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American counterparts cannot. At the end of the Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.<ref name=\"MoD statement\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7097121.stm|title=Nuclear weapons security \u2013 MoD statement |author=Ministry of Defence (UK)|date=15 November 2007|publisher=BBC Newsnight |access-date=19 May 2008|author-link=Ministry of Defence (UK) }}</ref><ref name=\"British nuclear weapon control\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/uk/video/133000/bb/133417_16x9_bb.asx |title=British nuclear weapon control (streaming video) |first=Susan |last=Watts |author-link=Susan Watts |publisher=BBC Newsnight |date=November 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC press release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/11_november/15/newsnight.shtml |title=BBC press release |publisher=BBC |date=15 November 2007 |access-date=30 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DASO Trident missile test firing on-board HMS Vigilant MOD 45159461.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photograph of a hand holding a pistol grip; the grip has a red trigger button and a coiled cable connected to its base.|Weapons Engineer Officers Tactical Trigger used to launch a Trident Missile.

The former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] and [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]], General [[Charles Guthrie, Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank|Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank]], explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a [[prime minister]] ordering a launch without due cause. The constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the formal commander-in-chief is the [[British monarchy|monarch]], to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal: \"the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed&nbsp;... You have to remember that actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic.  The armed forces are loyal, and we live in a democracy, but actually their ultimate authority is the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]].\"<ref name=\"Whose hand is on the button?\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7758314.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Whose hand is on the button? | date=2 December 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2010 | first=Richard | last=Knight}}</ref>\n\nThe same interview pointed out that while the Prime Minister would have the constitutional authority to fire the Chief of the Defence Staff, he could not appoint a replacement as the position is appointed by the monarch.<ref name=\"Whose hand is on the button?\" /> The programme also addressed the workings of the system; detailing that [[two-man rule|two persons are required]] to authenticate each stage of the process before launching, with the submarine captain only able to access the firing trigger after two safes have been opened with keys held by the ship's executive and [[weapons engineering]] officers. It was explained that all Prime Ministers issue hand-written orders, termed the [[letters of last resort]], seen by their eyes only, sealed and stored within the safes of each of the four Royal Navy Vanguard class submarines. These notes instruct the submarine commander of what action to take in the event of the United Kingdom being attacked with nuclear weapons that destroy Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and/or the chain of command.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Rosenbaum |first=Ron |date=January 2009 |title=The Letter of Last Resort |magazine=Slate Magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2208219/pagenum/all |access-date=18 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the final orders of the Prime Minister are at his or her discretion, and no fixed options exist, there were four known options: retaliating with nuclear weapons, not retaliating with nuclear weapons, the submarine commander uses his own judgement, or the submarine commander places himself under [[United States]] or [[Australia]]n command if possible. This system of issuing notes containing orders in the event of the head of government's death is said to be unique to the United Kingdom (although the concept of written last orders, particularly of a ship's captain, is a naval tradition), with other nuclear powers using different procedures.

At the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, it was merged with the American [[Manhattan Project]]. The [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project]] saw British scientists participate in most of its work. The British government considered nuclear weapons to be a joint discovery, but the American [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act) restricted other countries, including the UK, from access to information about nuclear weapons. Fearing the loss of Britain's [[great power]] status, the UK resumed its own project, now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]]. On 3 October 1952, it detonated an atomic bomb in the [[Monte Bello Islands]] of [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]]. Eleven more British [[nuclear weapons tests in Australia]] were carried out over the following decade, including seven [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga]] in 1956 and 1957.\n\nThe [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] demonstrated Britain's ability to produce [[thermonuclear weapon]]s in the [[Operation Grapple]] nuclear tests in the Pacific, and led to the amendment of the McMahon Act. Since the [[1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement]], the US and the UK have cooperated extensively on nuclear security matters. The nuclear [[Special Relationship]] between the two countries has involved the exchange of [[classified information|classified]] scientific data and [[fissile material]]s such as [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium]]. The UK has not had a programme to develop an independent delivery system since the cancellation of the [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] in 1960. Instead, it has purchased US delivery systems for UK use, fitting them with warheads designed and manufactured by the UK's [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE) and its predecessor. Under the 1963 [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], the US supplied the UK with [[Polaris missile]]s and [[nuclear submarine]] technology. The US also supplied the RAF and [[British Army of the Rhine]] with nuclear weapons under [[Project E]] until 1992. Nuclear-capable American aircraft have been based in the UK since 1949, but the last US nuclear weapons were withdrawn in 2006.\n\nIn 1982, the Polaris Sales Agreement was amended to allow the UK to purchase [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] missiles. Since 1998, when the UK decommissioned its tactical [[WE.177]] bombs, the [[Trident (UK nuclear programme)|Trident]] has been the only operational nuclear weapons system in British service.

Only \"the threat of large-scale damage from similar weapons\" could prevent the Soviet Union from using atomic weapons in a war.{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=48, 397\u2013398}}\n\n[[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[John Slessor]], who became Chief of the Air Staff in 1950, wrote that year that the Soviet superiority in European forces was so great that even \"an ultimatum by Russia within the next two to three years\" might cause Western Europe to surrender without a war. He feared that the United Kingdom might also do so \"unless we can make ourselves far less defenceless than we are now.\" By 1952 the [[Air Ministry]] had abandoned the concept of a conventional defence of Western Europe.{{sfn|Ball|1995|pp=71, 78\u201379}} The hydrogen bomb increased the threat to Britain. In 1957, a government study stated that although RAF fighters would \"unquestionably be able to take a heavy toll of enemy bombers, a proportion would inevitably get through. Even if it were only a dozen, they could with megaton bombs inflict widespread devastation.\" Although disarmament remained a British goal, \"the only existing safeguard against major aggression is the power to threaten retaliation with nuclear weapons.\"{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\nChurchill stated in a 1955 speech that deterrence would be \"the parents of disarmament\" and that, unless Britain contributed to Western deterrence with its own weapons, during a war the targets that threatened it the most might not be prioritised. The Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], advanced the position that nuclear weapons would give Britain influence over targeting and American policy, and would affect strategy in the Middle East and Far East. His [[Secretary of State for Defence|Minister of Defence]], [[Duncan Sandys]], considered that nuclear weapons reduced Britain's dependence on the United States.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=248}} The 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] demonstrated that Britain was no longer a great power,{{sfn|Bowie|Platt|1984|p=43}} but increased the value to Britain of an independent nuclear deterrent that would give it greater influence with the US and USSR.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|p=141}} While the military target of British nuclear weapons was the Soviet Union, the political target was the United States.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=28}}\n[[File:100 years of the RAF MOD 45163623.jpg|thumb|left|[[Avro Vulcan]] bombers]]\nIndependent targeting was vital. The Chiefs of Staff believed that\u2014contrary to Tizard's view\u2014once the Soviet Union became able to attack the United States itself with nuclear weapons in the late 1950s, America might not risk its own cities to defend Europe, or not emphasise targets that endangered the United Kingdom more than the United States:{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=185\u2013187}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985\u20131986|pp=81\u201384}}\n{{quote|When New York is vulnerable to attack the United States will not use her strategic weapon in defence of London. The United Kingdom must, therefore, have its own retaliatory defence. Similarly, however, we will not be prepared to sacrifice the United Kingdom in the defence of say [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], and eventually each political unit must have its own means of retaliation.{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=416}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985\u20131986|p=83}} }}\n\nBritain thus needed the ability to convince the USSR that attacking Europe would be too costly regardless of American participation. Part of the perceived effectiveness of an independent deterrent was the willingness to target enemy cities. Slessor saw atomic weapons as a way to avoid a third devastating world war given that the two previous ones had begun without them. While he sought to de-emphasise city targeting in British plans as Air Chief,{{sfn|Baylis|1995|pp=110\u2013114}} Slessor wrote in 1954 after retirement:{{quote|And if [war] is forced upon us, we must be able to instantly deliver a crushing counter-attack upon aggression at its source\u2014not merely at its airfields, its launching sites and submarine bases, at its armies in the field but at the heart of the aggressor country.

As the Defence Council stated in 1980:{{quote|our force has to be visibly capable of making a massive strike on its own ...

The exercise was criticised as unrealistic as an actual exchange would be much larger, and did not include targets in [[Inner London]] such as [[Whitehall]].{{sfn|Openshaw|Steadman|Greene|1983|p=105}} Even so, the effect of the limited attack in Square Leg was estimated to be 29 million dead (53 per cent of the population) and 6.4 million seriously injured.{{sfn|Campbell|1982|pp=53\u201354}}\n* '''Exercise ''Hard Rock''''' was a combined communications and civil defence exercise planned for September and October 1982. It assumed a conventional war in Europe lasting two to three days, during which the UK would be attacked with conventional weapons, then a limited nuclear exchange, with 54 nuclear warheads used against military targets in the UK. 250,000 people protested against the exercise and 24 councils refused to participate. The limited scenario still assumed casualties of 7.9 million dead and 5 million injured.{{sfn|Campbell|1982|pp=53\u201354}} The scenario was ridiculed by the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and the exercise was postponed indefinitely.{{sfn|Wittner|2003|p=294}} The ''[[New Statesman]]'' later claimed the Ministry of Defence insisted on having a veto over proposed targets in the exercise and several were removed to make them politically more acceptable; for example, the nuclear submarine base at Faslane was removed from the target list.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hard Rock is cancelled again|newspaper=New Statesman|date=11 March 1983|page=6}}</ref>\n\n===Civil defence===\n\n{{Main|Civil defence|Protect and Survive}}\nSuccessive governments developed [[civil defence]] programmes aimed to prepare civilian and local government infrastructure for a nuclear strike on the UK.

Many different groups and individuals have been involved in [[anti-nuclear protests|anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests]] over the years. One of the most prominent anti-nuclear groups in the UK is the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). This national movement was founded in the late 1950s, initially in opposition to nuclear testing. It reached its peak around 1960, by which time it had evolved into a broader movement calling for Britain to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons, withdraw from NATO, and end the basing of US bombers armed with nuclear weapons in the UK.{{sfn|Bowie|Platt|1984|pp=63\u201370}}\n\nThe end of atmospheric nuclear testing, internal squabbles, and activists focusing their energies on other causes led to a rapid decline, but it revived in the early 1980s in the wake of the Thatcher government's December 1979 decision to deploy US GLCMs in the UK, and the announcement of its decision to purchase Trident in July 1980. Membership leapt from 3,000 in 1980 to 50,000 a year later, and rallies for unilateral nuclear disarmament in London in October 1981 and June 1982 attracted 250,000 marchers, the largest ever mass demonstrations in the UK up to that time.{{sfn|Bowie|Platt|1984|pp=63\u201370}}\n\n==End of cross-party support==\n\nThere was little dissent in the House of Commons from the government's nuclear weapons policy; it had almost bipartisan support until 1960, with only the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] temporarily dissenting in 1958. Despite opposition from its left wing the Labour party supported British nuclear weapons but opposed tests, and Labour Opposition Leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and shadow foreign secretary [[Aneurin Bevan]] agreed with Sandys on the importance of reducing dependence on the American deterrent. Bevan told his colleagues that their demand for [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] would send a future Labour government \"naked into the conference chamber\" during international negotiations.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|p=145}}\n\n[[File:Jeremy Corbyn Says -StopTrident - 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]] speaks at the #StopTrident rally at [[Trafalgar Square]] on 27 February 2016]]\nThe ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and other newspapers critical of the Conservative government supported the British deterrent, although the ''Guardian'' did criticise the government for relying on developing bombers rather than missiles to carry the weapons.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=65}} In 1962 it stated that the forthcoming [[Chinese nuclear weapon]] was a reason for having more than one Western nuclear nation. From 1955 the government chose to emphasize the nuclear deterrent and de-emphasize conventional forces.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|p=140}} ''[[The Economist]]'', the ''[[New Statesman]]'', and many left-wing newspapers supported the reliance on nuclear deterrence and nuclear weapons, but in their view considered that of the United States would suffice, and that of the costs of the \"nuclear umbrella\" was best left to be borne by the United States alone.{{sfn|Groom|1974|pp=131\u2013154}}\n\nGaitskell's Labour party ceased supporting an independent deterrent in 1960 via its new \"Policy for Peace\", after the cancellation of Blue Streak made nuclear independence less likely. Labour also adopted a resolution favouring unilateral disarmament. Although Gaitskell opposed the resolution and it was reversed in 1961 in favor of continuing support of a general Western nuclear deterrent, the party's opposition to a British deterrent remained and became more prominent.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|pp=146\u2013156}}\n\nThis became a campaign issue during the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. [[Alec Douglas-Home]]'s incumbent Conservatives stated that the British deterrent was both necessary for independence from the Americans and maintaining British world influence, and was \"working for peace\" in such cases as the passage of the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Led by Gaitskell's successor [[Harold Wilson]], Labour emphasized domestic economic issues but called deterrence the \"Tory Nuclear Pretense\" which would be neither independent nor effective. The populace's greater interest in domestic over foreign policy likely contributed to Labour's victory.{{sfn|Epstein|1966|pp=146\u2013156}}\n\nThe 1982 [[Labour Party Conference]] adopted a platform calling for the removal of the GLCMs, the scrapping of Polaris and the cancellation of Trident. This was reaffirmed by the 1986 conference. While the party was given little chance of winning the 1983 election in the aftermath of the Falklands War, polls had shown Labour ahead of the Conservatives in 1986 and 1987. In the wake of Labour's unsuccessful performance in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election]], the Labour Party leader, [[Neil Kinnock]], despite his own unilateralist convictions, moved to drop the party's disarmament policy, which he saw as a contributing factor in its defeat.{{sfn|Scott|2012|pp=116\u2013118}}<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge83.shtml |title=Politics 97 |access-date=13 July 2018}}</ref> The party formally voted to do so in October 1989.{{sfn|Chalmers|1999|p=62}}\n\nPro-independence Scottish political parties\u2014the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), [[Scottish Green Party]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP) and [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]]\u2014are opposed to the basing of the Trident system close to Glasgow, Scotland's largest city.{{sfn|Ritchie|2016|pp=658\u2013659}} Some members and ex-members of those parties, such as [[Tommy Sheridan]] and [[Lloyd Quinan]], have taken part in blockades of the base.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Telegraph |title=Sheridan held again in Faslane protest |first=Tara |last=Womersley |date=23 October 2001 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1360222/Sheridan-held-again-in-Faslane-protest.html |access-date=5 May 2018 }}</ref> In the House of Commons vote in 2007, the majority of Scottish members of parliament (MPs) voted against upgrading the system, while a substantial majority of English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs voted in favour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6452275.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Scots Labour MPs rebel on Trident|date=14 March 2007|access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear posture==\nThe UK has relaxed its nuclear posture since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's 1998 [[Strategic Defence Review]] made reductions from the plans announced by the previous [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government:\n*The stockpile of \"operationally available warheads\" was reduced from 300 to \"less than 200\"\n*The final batch of missile bodies would not be purchased, limiting the fleet to 58.\n*A submarine's load of warheads was reduced from 96 to 48. This reduced the explosive power of the warheads on a Vanguard class Trident submarine to \"one third less than a Polaris submarine armed with Chevaline\". However, 48 warheads per Trident submarine represents a 50% increase on the 32 warheads per submarine of Chevaline. Total explosive power has been in decline for decades as the accuracy of missiles has improved, therefore requiring less power to destroy each target. Trident can destroy 48 targets per submarine, as opposed to 32 targets that could be destroyed by Chevaline.\n*Submarines' missiles would not be targeted, but rather at several days \"notice to fire\".\n*Although one submarine would always be on patrol it will operate on a \"reduced day-to-day alert state\". A major factor in maintaining a constant patrol is to avoid \"misunderstanding or escalation if a Trident submarine were to sail during a period of crisis\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E50E/0/sdr1998_complete.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121018172816/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/65F3D7AC-4340-4119-93A2-20825848E50E/0/sdr1998_complete.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-18 |publisher=UK National Archive |access-date=2 August 2018 |title=Strategic Defence Review |date=July 1998 }}</ref>\n\nCurrent UK posture is as it has been for many years; Trident SLBMs still provide the long-range strategic element.

A closed-circuit television system was set up between 10 Downing Street and the SSBN Control Officer at the [[Northwood Headquarters]] of the Royal Navy. Both the Prime Minister and the SSBN Control Officer would be able to see each other on their monitors when the command was given. If the link failed \u2013 for instance during a nuclear attack or when the PM was away from Downing Street \u2013 the Prime Minister would send an authentication code which could be verified at Northwood. The PM would then broadcast a firing order to the SSBN submarines via the Very Low Frequency radio station at Rugby. The UK has not deployed control equipment requiring codes to be sent before weapons can be used, such as the U.S. [[Permissive Action Link]], which if installed would preclude the possibility that military officers could launch British nuclear weapons without authorisation.<ref name=\"MoD statement\" /><ref name=\"British nuclear weapon control\" /><ref name=\"BBC press release\" />\n\nUntil 1998, when it was withdrawn from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard [[tubular pin tumbler lock]] (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard [[allen key]] was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American counterparts cannot. At the end of the Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.<ref name=\"MoD statement\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7097121.stm|title=Nuclear weapons security \u2013 MoD statement |author=Ministry of Defence (UK)|date=15 November 2007|publisher=BBC Newsnight |access-date=19 May 2008|author-link=Ministry of Defence (UK) }}</ref><ref name=\"British nuclear weapon control\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news/uk/video/133000/bb/133417_16x9_bb.asx |title=British nuclear weapon control (streaming video) |first=Susan |last=Watts |author-link=Susan Watts |publisher=BBC Newsnight |date=November 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC press release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/11_november/15/newsnight.shtml |title=BBC press release |publisher=BBC |date=15 November 2007 |access-date=30 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DASO Trident missile test firing on-board HMS Vigilant MOD 45159461.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photograph of a hand holding a pistol grip; the grip has a red trigger button and a coiled cable connected to its base.|Weapons Engineer Officers Tactical Trigger used to launch a Trident Missile.

The former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] and [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]], General [[Charles Guthrie, Baron Guthrie of Craigiebank|Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank]], explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a [[prime minister]] ordering a launch without due cause. The constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the formal commander-in-chief is the [[British monarchy|monarch]], to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal: \"the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed&nbsp;...

It was explained that all Prime Ministers issue hand-written orders, termed the [[letters of last resort]], seen by their eyes only, sealed and stored within the safes of each of the four Royal Navy Vanguard class submarines.

Her emphasis on a grassroots approach to the struggle for equal rights influenced the growth and success of the modern civil rights movement of the mid-20th century.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Ransby, ''Ella Baker''</ref>\n\n===NAACP (1938\u20131953)===\nIn 1938 Baker began her long association with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which was then based in New York City. In December 1940 she started work there as a secretary. She traveled widely for the organization, especially in the South, recruiting members, raising money, and organizing local chapters. She was named director of branches in 1943,<ref>Ransby, ''Ella Baker'', p. 137.</ref> and became the highest-ranking woman in the NAACP. An outspoken woman, Baker believed in egalitarian ideals. She pushed the NAACP to decentralize its leadership structure and to aid its membership in more activist campaigns at the local level.\n\nBaker believed that the strength of an organization grew from the bottom up and not the top down. She believed that the work of the branches was the NAACP's lifeblood. Baker despised elitism and placed her confidence in many. She believed that the bedrock of any social change organization is not the eloquence or credentials of its top leaders, but in the commitment and hard work of the rank and file membership and the willingness and ability of those members to engage in a process of discussion, debate, and decision making.<ref>Ransby, p. 139.</ref> She especially stressed the importance of young people and women in the organization.\n\nWhile traveling throughout the South on behalf of the NAACP, Baker met hundreds of black people, establishing lasting relationships with them. She slept in their homes, ate at their tables, spoke in their churches, and earned their trust. She wrote thank-you notes and expressed her gratitude to the people she met. This personalized approach to political work was one important aspect of Baker's effective effort to recruit more members, both men and women, into the NAACP.<ref>Ransby, p. 136.</ref> Baker formed a network of people in the South who would be important in the continued fight for civil rights. Whereas some northern organizers tended to talk down to rural southerners, Baker's ability to treat everyone with respect helped her in recruiting. Baker fought to make the NAACP more democratic. She tried to find a balance between voicing her concerns and maintaining a unified front.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1946, Baker directed leadership conferences in several major cities, such as [[Chicago]] and [[Atlanta]]. She got top officials to deliver lectures, offer welcoming remarks, and conduct workshops.<ref>Ransby, p. 150.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Baker took in her niece Jackie, whose mother was unable to care for her. Due to her new responsibilities, Baker left her full-time position with the NAACP and began to serve as a volunteer. She soon joined the New York branch of the NAACP to work on local school desegregation and police brutality issues. She became its president in 1952.<ref>Ransby, p. 148.</ref> In this role, she supervised the field secretaries and coordinated the national office's work with local groups.<ref>Ransby, p. 137.</ref> Baker's top priority was to lessen the organization's bureaucracy and give more power to women within the organization; this included reducing [[Walter Francis White]]'s dominating role as executive secretary.\n\nShe did not believe that the program should be primarily channeled through White, the executive secretary, and the national office, but rather through the people out in the field. She lobbied to reduce the rigid hierarchy, place more power in the hands of capable local leaders, and give greater responsibility and autonomy to local branches.<ref>Ransby, p. 138.</ref>  In 1953 she resigned from the presidency to run for the [[New York City Council]] on the Liberal Party ticket, but she was unsuccessful.<ref>Ransby, pp. 105\u2013158.</ref>\n\n===Southern Christian Leadership Conference (1957\u20131960)===\nIn January 1957, Baker went to Atlanta to attend a conference aimed at developing a new regional organization to build on the success of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] in Alabama. After a second conference in February, the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) was formed. This was initially planned as a loosely structured coalition of church-based leaders who were engaged in civil rights struggles across the South.<ref>Ransby, p. 174.</ref> The group wanted to emphasize the use of nonviolent actions to bring about social progress and racial justice for southern blacks. They intended to rely on the existing black churches, at the heart of their communities, as a base of its support. Its strength would be built on the political activities of local church affiliates. The SCLC leaders envisioned themselves as the political arm of the black church.<ref>Ransby, \"Ella Baker\", p. 175.</ref>\n\nThe SCLC first appeared publicly as an organization at the 1957 [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]]. Baker was one of three major organizers of this large-scale event. She demonstrated her ability to straddle organizational lines, ignoring and minimizing rivalries and battles.<ref>Ransby, \"Ella Baker\", p. 176.</ref> The conference's first project was the 1958 [[Crusade for Citizenship]], a [[voter registration]] campaign to increase the number of registered African-American voters for the 1958 and 1960 elections. Baker was hired as Associate Director, the first staff person for the SCLC. Reverend John Tilley became the first Executive Director. Baker worked closely with southern civil rights activists in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, and gained respect for her organizing abilities. She helped initiate voter registration campaigns and identify other local grievances. Their strategy included education, sermons in churches, and efforts to establish grassroots centers to stress the importance of the vote. They also planned to rely on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to protect local voters.<ref name=\"morris\"/> While the project did not achieve its immediate goals, it laid the groundwork for strengthening local activist centers to build a mass movement for the vote across the South.<ref name=\"morris\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=7vyHY9DWcu8C&dq=Tennessee+Highlander+%22subversive+organization%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s Aldon D. Morris, ''The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement''], New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986, pp.102-108</ref> After John Tilley resigned as director of the SCLC, Baker lived and worked in Atlanta for two and a half years as interim executive director until Reverend [[Wyatt Tee Walker]] started in the role in April 1960.<ref>Ransby, pp. 170\u2013175.</ref>\n\nBaker's job with the SCLC was more frustrating than fruitful. She was unsettled politically, physically, and emotionally. She had no solid allies in the office.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Historian Thomas F. Jackson notes that Baker criticized the organization for \"programmatic sluggishness and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|King]]'s distance from the people. King was a better orator than democratic crusader [she] concluded.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8k6btUYR68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=ella+baker,+martin+king&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDj5q51I_OAhXFdR4KHW19BAA4ChDoAQguMAM#v=onepage&q=ella%20baker%2C%20martin%20king&f=false Thomas F. Jackson, ''From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Struggle for Economic Justice''], Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007, p. 104</ref>\n\n==\"Participatory democracy\"==\nIn the 1960s, the idea of \"[[participatory democracy]]\" became popular among political activists, including those involved in the Civil Rights Movement. It combined the traditional appeal of [[democracy]] with an innovative tie to broader grass roots participation.\n\nThere were three primary emphases to this new movement:\n* An appeal for grass roots involvement of people throughout society, while making their own decisions\n* The minimization of ([[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]]) [[hierarchy]] and the associated emphasis on expertise and professionalism as a basis for leadership\n* A call for direct action as an answer to fear, isolation, and intellectual detachment<ref>''Women in the Civil Rights Movement,'' pp. 51-52.</ref>\n\nElla Baker said:\n\n<blockquote>You didn't see me on television, you didn't see news stories about me. The kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong people don't need strong leaders.<ref>''Women in the Civil Rights Movement'', p. 51.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to activist [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], Baker advocated a more collectivist model of leadership over the \"prevailing messianic style of the period.\"<ref name=\"abu-jamal\">[[Mumia Abu-Jamal|Abu-Jamal, Mumia]]. ''We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party''. [[South End Press]]: Cambridge, 2004. p. 159</ref> Baker was largely arguing against the civil rights movement being structured along the organization model of the black church. The black church then had largely female membership and male leadership. Baker questioned not only the gendered hierarchy of the civil rights movement, but also that of the Black church.<ref name=\"abu-jamal\"/>\n\nElla Baker and Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as other SCLC members, were reported to have differences in opinion and philosophy during the 1950s and 1960s. She was older than many of the young ministers she worked with, which added to their tensions. She once said that the \"movement made Martin, and not Martin the movement.\" When she gave a speech urging activists to take control of the movement themselves, rather than rely on a leader with \"heavy feet of clay,\" it was widely interpreted as a denunciation of King.<ref name=\"harris\">[http://www.jacksonadvocateonline.com/ella-baker-backbone-of-the-civil%E2%80%88rights%E2%80%88movement/ Barbra Harris, \"Ella Baker: Backbone of the Civil Rights Movement\"], ''Jackson Advocate'' News Service</ref>\n\nElla's philosophy was \"power to the people.\" <ref name=\":1\">Elliott, Aprele. \u201cElla Baker: Free Agent in the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d Journal of Black Studies, vol. 26, no. 5, 1996, pp. 593\u2013603. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2784885. </ref> By members working together, Baker believed that a group's force could make significant changes. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (1960\u20131966)===\nThat same year, 1960, on the heels of regional desegregation sit-ins led by black college students, Baker persuaded the SCLC to invite southern university students to the Southwide Youth Leadership Conference at Shaw University on Easter weekend. This was a gathering of sit-in leaders to meet, assess their struggles, and explore the possibilities for future actions.<ref>Ransby, p. 240.</ref> At this meeting the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC, pronounced \"snick\") was formed.\n\nBaker saw the potential for a special type of leadership by the young sit-in leaders, who were not yet prominent in the movement. She believed they could revitalize the Black Freedom Movement and take it in a new direction. Baker wanted to bring the sit-in participants together in a way that would sustain the momentum of their actions, teach them the skills necessary, provide the resources that were needed, and also help them to coalesce into a more militant and democratic force.<ref>Ransby, \"Ella Baker\", p.239.</ref> To this end she worked to keep the students independent of the older, church-based leadership. In her address at Shaw, she warned the activists to be wary of \"leader-centered orientation.\" [[Julian Bond]] later described the speech as \"an eye opener\" and probably the best of the conference. \"She didn't say, 'Don't let Martin Luther King tell you what to do,'\" Bond remembers, \"but you got the real feeling that that's what she meant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1500989;jsessionid=753E38E197A03D3451C5FD99A369C91E|title=Baker, Ella Josephine (13 December 1903\u201313 December 1986), civil rights organizer {{!}} American National Biography|website=www.anb.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n\nSNCC became the most active organization in the deeply oppressed Mississippi Delta. It was relatively open to women.<ref>''Women in the Civil Rights Movement'', p. 2.</ref> Following the conference at Shaw, Baker resigned from the SCLC and began a long and close relationship with SNCC.<ref>''Creating Black Americans'', pp. 291.</ref> Along with [[Howard Zinn]], Baker was one of SNCC's highly revered adult advisors, and she was known as the \"Godmother of SNCC.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=DEGREGORY |first1=CRYSTAL |title=Godmother of SNCC: Remembering Shaw Alumna Ella Baker |url=https://hbcustory.wordpress.com/2012/04/17/godmother-of-sncc-remembering-shaw-alumna-ella-baker/ |website=hbcustory |accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Baker persuaded the SNCC to form two wings: one wing for direct action and the second wing for voter registration. With Baker's help SNCC, along with the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), coordinated the region-wide [[Freedom Rides]] of 1961. They also expanded their grassroots movement among black sharecroppers, tenant farmers and others throughout the South. Ella Baker insisted that \"strong people don't need strong leaders,\" and criticized the notion of a single charismatic leader of movements for social change. In keeping the idea of \"participatory democracy\", Baker wanted each person to get involved.<ref>''Creating Black Americans'', p. 292.</ref> She also argued that \"people under the heel,\" the most oppressed members of any community, \"had to be the ones to decide what action they were going to take to get (out) from under their oppression\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ella-baker-and-the-politi_b_7702936|title=Ella Baker and the Politics of Hope -- Lessons From the Civil Rights Movement|last=Boyte|first=Harry|last2=Philosophy|first2=ContributorSenior Scholar in Public Work|date=2015-07-01|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03|last3=Democracy|first3=Sabo Center for|last4=College|first4=Citizenship Augsburg}}</ref>\n\nShe was a teacher and mentor to the young people of SNCC, influencing such important future leaders as [[Julian Bond]], [[Diane Nash]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[Curtis Muhammad]], [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], and [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]]. Through SNCC, Baker's ideas of group-centered leadership and the need for radical democratic social change spread throughout the student movements of the 1960s. For instance, the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], the major antiwar group of the day, promoted participatory democracy. These ideas also influenced a wide range of radical and progressive groups that would form in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Ransby, pp. 239\u2013272.</ref>\n\nIn 1964 Baker helped organize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) as an alternative to the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party. She worked as the coordinator of the Washington office of the MFDP and accompanied a delegation of the MFDP to the 1964 National Democratic Party convention in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The group wanted to challenge the national party to affirm the rights of African Americans to participate in party elections in the South, where they were still largely disenfranchised. When MFDP delegates challenged the pro-segregationist, all-white official delegation, a major conflict ensued. The MFDP delegation was not seated, but their influence on the Democratic Party later helped to elect many black leaders in Mississippi. They forced a rule change to allow women and minorities to sit as delegates at the [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref>Ransby, ''Ella Baker'', pp. 330\u2013344.</ref>\n\nThe 1964 schism with the national Democratic Party led SNCC toward the \"[[black power]]\" position. Baker was less involved with SNCC during this period, but her withdrawal was due more to her declining health than to ideological differences. According to her biographer Barbara Ransby, Baker believed that black power was a relief from the \"stale and unmoving demands and language of the more mainstream civil rights groups at the time.\"<ref>Ransby, p. 347-351.</ref> She also accepted the turn towards armed self-defense that SNCC made in the course of its development. Her friend and biographer [[Joanne Grant]] wrote that \"Baker, who always said that she would never be able to turn the other cheek, turned a blind eye to the prevalence of weapons. While she herself would rely on her fists \u2026 she had no qualms about target practice.\"<ref>Joanne Grant, ''Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'' (Wiley, 1999), 194-199</ref>\n\n===Southern Conference Education Fund (1962\u20131967)===\nFrom 1962 to 1967, Baker worked on the staff of the [https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/alliances-relationships/scef/ Southern Conference Education Fund] (SCEF). Its goal was to help black and white people work together for social justice; the interracial desegregation and human rights group was based in the South.<!--where?  --><ref name=autogenerated1 /> SCEF raised funds for black activists, lobbied for implementation of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s civil rights proposals, and tried to educate southern whites about the evils of racism.<ref>Ransby, p. 231.</ref> Federal civil rights legislation was passed by Congress and signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1964 and 1965, but implementation would take years.\n\nIn SCEF, Baker worked closely with her friend [[Anne Braden]], a white, longtime activist against racism. Braden had been accused in the 1950s of being a communist by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Baker believed that socialism was a humane alternative to capitalism, but she had mixed feelings about communism. She became a staunch defender of Anne Braden and her husband [[Carl Braden|Carl]]; she encouraged [[SNCC]] to reject red-baiting because she viewed it as divisive and unfair. During the 1960s, Baker participated in a speaking tour and co-hosted several meetings on the importance of linking civil rights and civil liberties.<ref>Ransby, pp. 209\u2013238, 273\u2013328.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1967 Ella Baker returned to New York City, where she continued her activism. She later collaborated with [[Arthur Kinoy]] and others to form the Mass Party Organizing Committee, a socialist organization. In 1972 she traveled the country in support of the \"Free Angela\" campaign, demanding the release of activist and writer [[Angela Davis]], who had been arrested in California as a communist. Davis was acquitted after representing herself in court.\n\nBaker also supported the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] independence movement, and spoke out against [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. Baker allied with a number of women's groups, including the [[Third World Women's Alliance]] and the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. She remained an activist until her death in 1986 on her 83rd birthday.<ref>Ransby, pp. 344\u2013374.</ref>\n\nElla Baker was a very private person. Many people close to her did not know that she was married for 20 years to T. J. \"Bob\" Roberts. Baker kept her own surname.<ref>Ransby, pp. 101\u2013103.</ref> She left no diaries.\n\n==Representation in other media==\n*The 1981 documentary ''Fundi: The Story of Ella Baker'', directed by Joanne Grant, explored Baker's important role in the civil rights movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliohistory.org/click/politics-social/civil-rights/|title=Click - Women in Civil Rights - Women in the Civil Rights Movement, Ella Baker, Black Women and Civil Rights, Women and Civil Rights Act|website=www.cliohistory.org|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n*[[Bernice Johnson Reagon]] wrote \"Ella's Song,\" in Baker's honor, for the film ''Fundi.''<ref>[https://www.wbai.org/programupdates.php?programupdate=323], WBAI.org</ref>\n*Several biographies have been written about Baker, including Barbara Ransby's ''Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision'' (2003)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ransby|first=Barbara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwGN3Z6ga28C&lpg=PR1&ots=qo0u1N1E7b&dq=Ella%20Josephine%20Baker&lr&pg=PR12#v=onepage&q=Ella%20Josephine%20Baker&f=false|title=Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision|date=2003|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-2778-9|language=en}}</ref>, published by the University of North Carolina Press.<ref>{{Cite web|title = UNC Press - Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement|url = http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=270|website = uncpress.unc.edu|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Copyright 2016 The University of North Carolina at Chapel|last = Hill}}</ref> Ransby is a historian and longtime activist.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.colorlines.com/articles/ella-taught-me-shattering-myth-leaderless-movement|title = Ella Taught Me: Shattering the Myth of the Leaderless Movement|date = June 12, 2015|access-date = |website = Colorlines|publisher = |last = Ransby|first = Barbara}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Quilting a Movement|url = http://inthesetimes.com/article/7074/quilting_a_movement|newspaper = In These Times|date = 2011-04-04|access-date = 2016-02-22|issn = 0160-5992|language = en-US|first = Barbara|last = Ransby}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*In 1984 Baker received a [[Candace Award]] from the [[National Coalition of 100 Black Women]].<ref>{{cite web |website=National Coalition of 100 Black Women |title=Candace Award Recipients 1982-1990, Page 1 |url=http://www.ncbw.org/programs/award1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030314021634/http://www.ncbw.org/programs/award1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2003 }}</ref>\n*Her papers are held by the [[New York Public Library]].<ref>[http://www.nypl.org/archives/3457 Ella Baker papers, 1926-1986], [[New York Public Library]]</ref>\n*In 1994 Ella Baker was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/ella-baker/|title=Baker, Ella|website=National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n*In 1996 the [[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]], a non-profit strategy and action center based in Oakland, California, was founded and named for her.\n*In 2003 The Ella Jo Baker Intentional Community Cooperative, a 15-unit cohousing community, began living together in a renovated house in Washington, DC.\n*In 2009 Ella Baker was honored on a U.S. postage stamp.\n*In 2014 the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] established a visiting professorship to honor Ella Baker.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jbhe.com/2014/10/shana-redmonds-named-to-professorship-honoring-civil-rights-activist-ella-baker/|title=Shana Redmonds Named to Professorship Honoring Civil Rights Activist Ella Baker|date=2014-10-20|website=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]]\n* [[List of civil rights leaders]]\n*[https://ellabaker.lwsd.org/about-us/our-approach Ella Baker Elementary School]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* S.

She protested [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italy's invasion of Ethiopia]] and supported the campaign to free the [[Scottsboro Boys|Scottsboro defendants]] in Alabama, a group of young black men accused of raping two white women.

Ella Baker rarely discussed her private life or marital status. According to fellow activist, [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]], many women within the Civil Rights Movement followed Baker's example, adopting a practice of [[Dissembling|dissemblance]] about their private lives that allowed them to be accepted as individuals within the movement.<ref>Ransby, p. 9</ref>\n\nBaker befriended [[John Henrik Clarke]], a future scholar and activist; [[Pauli Murray]], a future writer and civil rights lawyer, and others who would become lifelong friends.<ref>Ransby, ''Ella Baker'', pp. 64\u2013104.</ref> The [[Harlem Renaissance]] influenced Baker in her thoughts and teachings. She advocated widespread, local action as a means of social change. Her emphasis on a grassroots approach to the struggle for equal rights influenced the growth and success of the modern civil rights movement of the mid-20th century.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Ransby, ''Ella Baker''</ref>\n\n===NAACP (1938\u20131953)===\nIn 1938 Baker began her long association with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which was then based in New York City. In December 1940 she started work there as a secretary. She traveled widely for the organization, especially in the South, recruiting members, raising money, and organizing local chapters. She was named director of branches in 1943,<ref>Ransby, ''Ella Baker'', p. 137.</ref> and became the highest-ranking woman in the NAACP. An outspoken woman, Baker believed in egalitarian ideals. She pushed the NAACP to decentralize its leadership structure and to aid its membership in more activist campaigns at the local level.\n\nBaker believed that the strength of an organization grew from the bottom up and not the top down. She believed that the work of the branches was the NAACP's lifeblood. Baker despised elitism and placed her confidence in many. She believed that the bedrock of any social change organization is not the eloquence or credentials of its top leaders, but in the commitment and hard work of the rank and file membership and the willingness and ability of those members to engage in a process of discussion, debate, and decision making.<ref>Ransby, p. 139.</ref> She especially stressed the importance of young people and women in the organization.\n\nWhile traveling throughout the South on behalf of the NAACP, Baker met hundreds of black people, establishing lasting relationships with them. She slept in their homes, ate at their tables, spoke in their churches, and earned their trust. She wrote thank-you notes and expressed her gratitude to the people she met. This personalized approach to political work was one important aspect of Baker's effective effort to recruit more members, both men and women, into the NAACP.<ref>Ransby, p. 136.</ref> Baker formed a network of people in the South who would be important in the continued fight for civil rights. Whereas some northern organizers tended to talk down to rural southerners, Baker's ability to treat everyone with respect helped her in recruiting. Baker fought to make the NAACP more democratic. She tried to find a balance between voicing her concerns and maintaining a unified front.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1946, Baker directed leadership conferences in several major cities, such as [[Chicago]] and [[Atlanta]]. She got top officials to deliver lectures, offer welcoming remarks, and conduct workshops.<ref>Ransby, p. 150.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Baker took in her niece Jackie, whose mother was unable to care for her. Due to her new responsibilities, Baker left her full-time position with the NAACP and began to serve as a volunteer. She soon joined the New York branch of the NAACP to work on local school desegregation and police brutality issues. She became its president in 1952.<ref>Ransby, p. 148.</ref> In this role, she supervised the field secretaries and coordinated the national office's work with local groups.<ref>Ransby, p. 137.</ref> Baker's top priority was to lessen the organization's bureaucracy and give more power to women within the organization; this included reducing [[Walter Francis White]]'s dominating role as executive secretary.\n\nShe did not believe that the program should be primarily channeled through White, the executive secretary, and the national office, but rather through the people out in the field. She lobbied to reduce the rigid hierarchy, place more power in the hands of capable local leaders, and give greater responsibility and autonomy to local branches.<ref>Ransby, p. 138.</ref>  In 1953 she resigned from the presidency to run for the [[New York City Council]] on the Liberal Party ticket, but she was unsuccessful.<ref>Ransby, pp. 105\u2013158.</ref>\n\n===Southern Christian Leadership Conference (1957\u20131960)===\nIn January 1957, Baker went to Atlanta to attend a conference aimed at developing a new regional organization to build on the success of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] in Alabama. After a second conference in February, the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) was formed. This was initially planned as a loosely structured coalition of church-based leaders who were engaged in civil rights struggles across the South.<ref>Ransby, p. 174.</ref> The group wanted to emphasize the use of nonviolent actions to bring about social progress and racial justice for southern blacks. They intended to rely on the existing black churches, at the heart of their communities, as a base of its support. Its strength would be built on the political activities of local church affiliates. The SCLC leaders envisioned themselves as the political arm of the black church.<ref>Ransby, \"Ella Baker\", p. 175.</ref>\n\nThe SCLC first appeared publicly as an organization at the 1957 [[Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom]]. Baker was one of three major organizers of this large-scale event. She demonstrated her ability to straddle organizational lines, ignoring and minimizing rivalries and battles.<ref>Ransby, \"Ella Baker\", p. 176.</ref> The conference's first project was the 1958 [[Crusade for Citizenship]], a [[voter registration]] campaign to increase the number of registered African-American voters for the 1958 and 1960 elections. Baker was hired as Associate Director, the first staff person for the SCLC. Reverend John Tilley became the first Executive Director. Baker worked closely with southern civil rights activists in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, and gained respect for her organizing abilities. She helped initiate voter registration campaigns and identify other local grievances. Their strategy included education, sermons in churches, and efforts to establish grassroots centers to stress the importance of the vote. They also planned to rely on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to protect local voters.<ref name=\"morris\"/> While the project did not achieve its immediate goals, it laid the groundwork for strengthening local activist centers to build a mass movement for the vote across the South.<ref name=\"morris\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=7vyHY9DWcu8C&dq=Tennessee+Highlander+%22subversive+organization%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s Aldon D.

She was unsettled politically, physically, and emotionally. She had no solid allies in the office.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Historian Thomas F. Jackson notes that Baker criticized the organization for \"programmatic sluggishness and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|King]]'s distance from the people. King was a better orator than democratic crusader [she] concluded.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8k6btUYR68C&printsec=frontcover&dq=ella+baker,+martin+king&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDj5q51I_OAhXFdR4KHW19BAA4ChDoAQguMAM#v=onepage&q=ella%20baker%2C%20martin%20king&f=false Thomas F.

It combined the traditional appeal of [[democracy]] with an innovative tie to broader grass roots participation.\n\nThere were three primary emphases to this new movement:\n* An appeal for grass roots involvement of people throughout society, while making their own decisions\n* The minimization of ([[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]]) [[hierarchy]] and the associated emphasis on expertise and professionalism as a basis for leadership\n* A call for direct action as an answer to fear, isolation, and intellectual detachment<ref>''Women in the Civil Rights Movement,'' pp. 51-52.</ref>\n\nElla Baker said:\n\n<blockquote>You didn't see me on television, you didn't see news stories about me. The kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong people don't need strong leaders.<ref>''Women in the Civil Rights Movement'', p. 51.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to activist [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], Baker advocated a more collectivist model of leadership over the \"prevailing messianic style of the period.\"<ref name=\"abu-jamal\">[[Mumia Abu-Jamal|Abu-Jamal, Mumia]]. ''We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party''. [[South End Press]]: Cambridge, 2004. p. 159</ref> Baker was largely arguing against the civil rights movement being structured along the organization model of the black church. The black church then had largely female membership and male leadership. Baker questioned not only the gendered hierarchy of the civil rights movement, but also that of the Black church.<ref name=\"abu-jamal\"/>\n\nElla Baker and Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as other SCLC members, were reported to have differences in opinion and philosophy during the 1950s and 1960s. She was older than many of the young ministers she worked with, which added to their tensions. She once said that the \"movement made Martin, and not Martin the movement.\" When she gave a speech urging activists to take control of the movement themselves, rather than rely on a leader with \"heavy feet of clay,\" it was widely interpreted as a denunciation of King.<ref name=\"harris\">[http://www.jacksonadvocateonline.com/ella-baker-backbone-of-the-civil%E2%80%88rights%E2%80%88movement/ Barbra Harris, \"Ella Baker: Backbone of the Civil Rights Movement\"], ''Jackson Advocate'' News Service</ref>\n\nElla's philosophy was \"power to the people.\" <ref name=\":1\">Elliott, Aprele. \u201cElla Baker: Free Agent in the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d Journal of Black Studies, vol. 26, no. 5, 1996, pp. 593\u2013603.

This was a gathering of sit-in leaders to meet, assess their struggles, and explore the possibilities for future actions.<ref>Ransby, p. 240.</ref> At this meeting the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC, pronounced \"snick\") was formed.\n\nBaker saw the potential for a special type of leadership by the young sit-in leaders, who were not yet prominent in the movement. She believed they could revitalize the Black Freedom Movement and take it in a new direction. Baker wanted to bring the sit-in participants together in a way that would sustain the momentum of their actions, teach them the skills necessary, provide the resources that were needed, and also help them to coalesce into a more militant and democratic force.<ref>Ransby, \"Ella Baker\", p.239.</ref> To this end she worked to keep the students independent of the older, church-based leadership. In her address at Shaw, she warned the activists to be wary of \"leader-centered orientation.\" [[Julian Bond]] later described the speech as \"an eye opener\" and probably the best of the conference. \"She didn't say, 'Don't let Martin Luther King tell you what to do,'\" Bond remembers, \"but you got the real feeling that that's what she meant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1500989;jsessionid=753E38E197A03D3451C5FD99A369C91E|title=Baker, Ella Josephine (13 December 1903\u201313 December 1986), civil rights organizer {{!}} American National Biography|website=www.anb.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n\nSNCC became the most active organization in the deeply oppressed Mississippi Delta.

With Baker's help SNCC, along with the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), coordinated the region-wide [[Freedom Rides]] of 1961. They also expanded their grassroots movement among black sharecroppers, tenant farmers and others throughout the South. Ella Baker insisted that \"strong people don't need strong leaders,\" and criticized the notion of a single charismatic leader of movements for social change. In keeping the idea of \"participatory democracy\", Baker wanted each person to get involved.<ref>''Creating Black Americans'', p. 292.</ref> She also argued that \"people under the heel,\" the most oppressed members of any community, \"had to be the ones to decide what action they were going to take to get (out) from under their oppression\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ella-baker-and-the-politi_b_7702936|title=Ella Baker and the Politics of Hope -- Lessons From the Civil Rights Movement|last=Boyte|first=Harry|last2=Philosophy|first2=ContributorSenior Scholar in Public Work|date=2015-07-01|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03|last3=Democracy|first3=Sabo Center for|last4=College|first4=Citizenship Augsburg}}</ref>\n\nShe was a teacher and mentor to the young people of SNCC, influencing such important future leaders as [[Julian Bond]], [[Diane Nash]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[Curtis Muhammad]], [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]], and [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]]. Through SNCC, Baker's ideas of group-centered leadership and the need for radical democratic social change spread throughout the student movements of the 1960s. For instance, the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], the major antiwar group of the day, promoted participatory democracy. These ideas also influenced a wide range of radical and progressive groups that would form in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Ransby, pp. 239\u2013272.</ref>\n\nIn 1964 Baker helped organize the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) as an alternative to the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party. She worked as the coordinator of the Washington office of the MFDP and accompanied a delegation of the MFDP to the 1964 National Democratic Party convention in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The group wanted to challenge the national party to affirm the rights of African Americans to participate in party elections in the South, where they were still largely disenfranchised. When MFDP delegates challenged the pro-segregationist, all-white official delegation, a major conflict ensued. The MFDP delegation was not seated, but their influence on the Democratic Party later helped to elect many black leaders in Mississippi. They forced a rule change to allow women and minorities to sit as delegates at the [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref>Ransby, ''Ella Baker'', pp. 330\u2013344.</ref>\n\nThe 1964 schism with the national Democratic Party led SNCC toward the \"[[black power]]\" position. Baker was less involved with SNCC during this period, but her withdrawal was due more to her declining health than to ideological differences. According to her biographer Barbara Ransby, Baker believed that black power was a relief from the \"stale and unmoving demands and language of the more mainstream civil rights groups at the time.\"<ref>Ransby, p. 347-351.</ref> She also accepted the turn towards armed self-defense that SNCC made in the course of its development. Her friend and biographer [[Joanne Grant]] wrote that \"Baker, who always said that she would never be able to turn the other cheek, turned a blind eye to the prevalence of weapons. While she herself would rely on her fists \u2026 she had no qualms about target practice.\"<ref>Joanne Grant, ''Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'' (Wiley, 1999), 194-199</ref>\n\n===Southern Conference Education Fund (1962\u20131967)===\nFrom 1962 to 1967, Baker worked on the staff of the [https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/alliances-relationships/scef/ Southern Conference Education Fund] (SCEF). Its goal was to help black and white people work together for social justice; the interracial desegregation and human rights group was based in the South.<!--where?  --><ref name=autogenerated1 /> SCEF raised funds for black activists, lobbied for implementation of President [[John F.

Johnson]] in 1964 and 1965, but implementation would take years.\n\nIn SCEF, Baker worked closely with her friend [[Anne Braden]], a white, longtime activist against racism. Braden had been accused in the 1950s of being a communist by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Baker believed that socialism was a humane alternative to capitalism, but she had mixed feelings about communism. She became a staunch defender of Anne Braden and her husband [[Carl Braden|Carl]]; she encouraged [[SNCC]] to reject red-baiting because she viewed it as divisive and unfair. During the 1960s, Baker participated in a speaking tour and co-hosted several meetings on the importance of linking civil rights and civil liberties.<ref>Ransby, pp. 209\u2013238, 273\u2013328.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1967 Ella Baker returned to New York City, where she continued her activism. She later collaborated with [[Arthur Kinoy]] and others to form the Mass Party Organizing Committee, a socialist organization. In 1972 she traveled the country in support of the \"Free Angela\" campaign, demanding the release of activist and writer [[Angela Davis]], who had been arrested in California as a communist. Davis was acquitted after representing herself in court.\n\nBaker also supported the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] independence movement, and spoke out against [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. Baker allied with a number of women's groups, including the [[Third World Women's Alliance]] and the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].

One horn meant \"yes\"; two meant \"no\". Clarabell often sprayed [[Buffalo Bob Smith]] with a [[Seltzer bottle|seltzer]] bottle and played practical jokes. Keeshan gave up the role in 1952, and was replaced.\n\nBy September 21, 1953, Keeshan came back to local TV on [[WABC-TV]], Channel 7 in New York City, in a new children's show, ''Time for Fun''. He played Corny the Clown, and this time he spoke.<ref name=\"Keeshan, Bob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/keeshanbob/keeshanbob.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications \u2013 Encyclopedia of Television|publisher=}}</ref> Later that same year, in addition to ''Time for Fun'', Keeshan began ''Tinker's Workshop'', a program aimed at preschoolers, with him playing the grandfather-like Tinker.<ref>Info on Mr. Keeshan's involvement with ''Time For Fun'' and ''Tinker's Workshop'' can be found in \"The NYC Kids Shows Round Up\"section of the \"TV Party\" website at www.tvparty.com</ref>\n\nDeveloping ideas from ''Tinker's Workshop'', Keeshan and his long-time friend Jack Miller submitted the concept of ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' to the [[CBS]] network, which was looking for innovative approaches to [[children's television]] programming. CBS approved the show, and Keeshan starred as the title character when it premiered on CBS on October 3, 1955.<ref name=\"Keeshan, Bob\"/> Keeshan described his character as based on  \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children.\" The show was an immediate success, and he served as its host for nearly three decades.  \n[[File:Captain Kangaroo promotional postcard 1961.JPG|left|thumb|From left: Dancing Bear, [[Bunny Rabbit (character)|Bunny Rabbit]], [[Captain Kangaroo]], Grandfather Clock, [[Mr. Moose]], and [[Mr. Green Jeans]]]]\nRecurring characters included his sidekick (and fan favorite) [[Mr. Green Jeans]] (played by [[Hugh Brannum|Hugh \"Lumpy\" Brannum]]), Dennis (played by Cosmo Allegretti), and puppets such as [[Bunny Rabbit (character)|Bunny Rabbit]] and [[Mr. Moose]].\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented: \"Captain Kangaroo, a round-faced, pleasant, mustachioed man possessed of an unshakable calm ... was one of the most enduring characters television ever produced.\"<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nKeeshan also had a Saturday morning show called ''Mister Mayor'' during the 1964\u201365 season.

Each paid visits to the other's show (Keeshan on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and Rogers on Captain Kangaroo) in 1970, and the two appeared together on the PBS special ''Springtime with Mister Rogers'' in 1980. The following year, Fred Rogers appeared briefly in Keeshan's TV special ''Good Evening, Captain'' (following Keeshan's 1981 heart attack), in which Rogers and [[Dick Clark]] both presented Keeshan with flowers at the end of the show.\n\n==Heart attack and cancellation==\nKeeshan suffered a severe [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] just moments after stepping off a plane at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] on July 11, 1981, which pushed the start of a revamped version of his show back to at least mid-August.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19810713&id=qPoSAAAAIBAJ&pg=4592,1792815| title='Captain Kangaroo' suffers heart attack, show delayed| newspaper=[[The Free Lance-Star]]| location=Fredericksburg, Virginia| date=July 13, 1981| agency=[[Associated Press]]| accessdate=August 24, 2018}}</ref> He had come to the city to accept a children's service award.\n\nKeeshan underwent triple-[[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]] and received an estimated 5,000 get-well wishes from fans during his hospitalization.<ref>{{cite news| date=August 3, 1987| title='Capt.

The program was retitled ''Wake Up with the Captain'', and moved to a new 7:00 am time slot. At the start of 1982, the show was rescheduled to an even earlier slot of 6:30 am. In the fall of 1982, CBS installed it as a weekend-only hour offering, and two years later, in the fall of 1984, the show became a Saturday half-hour entry.\n\nTired of CBS's constant reductions of his show, Keeshan left ''Captain Kangaroo'' when his contract with the network ended in December 1984, just nine months shy of the show's 30th anniversary. By 1987, repeats of the show were airing daily on many [[PBS]] stations.\n\nKeeshan's show was given a farewell of sorts with ''Captain Kangaroo and Friends'', a primetime network TV special that aired in 1985.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:WIKI BOB KEESHAN 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bob Keeshan speaking for [[United Way of America|United Way]] at [[BOK Tower]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in April 1999]]\n\nAfter ''Captain Kangaroo'' ended, Keeshan hosted 1985's ''[[CBS Storybreak]]'', which featured animated versions of children's literature.  Keeshan appeared in framing sequences for the animated stories, showcasing the book versions and suggesting similar books for the viewers to seek out.

One horn meant \"yes\"; two meant \"no\". Clarabell often sprayed [[Buffalo Bob Smith]] with a [[Seltzer bottle|seltzer]] bottle and played practical jokes. Keeshan gave up the role in 1952, and was replaced.\n\nBy September 21, 1953, Keeshan came back to local TV on [[WABC-TV]], Channel 7 in New York City, in a new children's show, ''Time for Fun''.

CBS approved the show, and Keeshan starred as the title character when it premiered on CBS on October 3, 1955.<ref name=\"Keeshan, Bob\"/> Keeshan described his character as based on  \"the warm relationship between grandparents and children.\" The show was an immediate success, and he served as its host for nearly three decades.  \n[[File:Captain Kangaroo promotional postcard 1961.JPG|left|thumb|From left: Dancing Bear, [[Bunny Rabbit (character)|Bunny Rabbit]], [[Captain Kangaroo]], Grandfather Clock, [[Mr. Moose]], and [[Mr. Green Jeans]]]]\nRecurring characters included his sidekick (and fan favorite) [[Mr. Green Jeans]] (played by [[Hugh Brannum|Hugh \"Lumpy\" Brannum]]), Dennis (played by Cosmo Allegretti), and puppets such as [[Bunny Rabbit (character)|Bunny Rabbit]] and [[Mr. Moose]].\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented: \"Captain Kangaroo, a round-faced, pleasant, mustachioed man possessed of an unshakable calm ... was one of the most enduring characters television ever produced.\"<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nKeeshan also had a Saturday morning show called ''Mister Mayor'' during the 1964\u201365 season.

Each paid visits to the other's show (Keeshan on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and Rogers on Captain Kangaroo) in 1970, and the two appeared together on the PBS special ''Springtime with Mister Rogers'' in 1980.

In the fall of 1982, CBS installed it as a weekend-only hour offering, and two years later, in the fall of 1984, the show became a Saturday half-hour entry.\n\nTired of CBS's constant reductions of his show, Keeshan left ''Captain Kangaroo'' when his contract with the network ended in December 1984, just nine months shy of the show's 30th anniversary. By 1987, repeats of the show were airing daily on many [[PBS]] stations.\n\nKeeshan's show was given a farewell of sorts with ''Captain Kangaroo and Friends'', a primetime network TV special that aired in 1985.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:WIKI BOB KEESHAN 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bob Keeshan speaking for [[United Way of America|United Way]] at [[BOK Tower]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in April 1999]]\n\nAfter ''Captain Kangaroo'' ended, Keeshan hosted 1985's ''[[CBS Storybreak]]'', which featured animated versions of children's literature.

It received positive reviews from critics, particularly for the performances of Pugh and Vaughn. It was also a commercial success, grossing $41.5 million worldwide against a budget of $11 mill.       Very great girl always mom job Amon to look up voicez plz 6367061496 I have a voice like Cleveland stew I prusse as me\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2002, in [[Norwich]], [[England]], 11-year-old [[Zak Zodiac|Zak Knight]] is engrossed by the [[WWE|WWF]] (now WWE) [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view event until his younger sister [[Paige (wrestler)|Saraya]] changes the channel to her favorite program, ''[[Charmed]]''. The siblings wrestle, urged on by their parents [[Ricky Knight|Rick]] and [[Sweet Saraya|Julia]]. Rick books the children for their first wrestling match where Saraya, initially reluctant to [[Intergender wrestling|wrestle a boy]], goes on to win as planned.\n\nAt 18, competing under the [[ring name]] \u201cBritani Knight\u201d, Saraya and her brother \u201cZak Zodiac\u201d help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially, ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. He finally agrees to a tryout before a [[WWE SmackDown|''SmackDown'']] taping at [[The O2 Arena]], and tells Saraya to find a different name as they \"already have a Britani\". The siblings receive advice from [[Dwayne Johnson]], and Saraya adopts the name Paige from [[Paige Matthews|her favorite character on ''Charmed'']].\n\nThe two try out with several other wrestlers and are all belittled by Morgan. He ultimately chooses Paige over the rest, despite her attempt to have Zak signed as well. With her brother's encouragement, Paige leaves for [[United States|America]] while Zak continues wrestling on the British [[independent circuit]], assisting his parents\u2019 wrestling school, and tending to his girlfriend and newborn son.\n\nArriving at [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] in [[Florida]], Paige has difficulty adjusting to the WWE style of entertainment \u2013 chiefly, the absence of intergender competition and the inexperience of her [[Women in WWE|fellow female trainees]] Jeri-Lynn, Kirsten, and Maddison. Paige struggles with performing promos and Morgan's constant belittlement. Morgan makes it clear to Zak that he will never be signed to WWE, and Zak falls into a [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Paige discovers her parents are selling merchandise of her likeness without her permission and have booked her in a match against Zak scheduled for her [[Christmas]] break.\n\nAt an NXT [[House show|live event]] and her in-ring debut, Paige is heckled by the crowd and freezes up, leaving the ring in tears. She decides to [[Hair coloring|bleach her hair blonde]] and [[Sunless tanning|spray tan]] to look more like her fellow trainees, which only causes more friction between them. After failing an [[obstacle course]], Paige lashes out at the trainees for [[gossip]]ing about her when they were actually discussing Kirsten, who has been away from her daughter in order to give her a better life.\n\nMorgan tells Paige that her brother's future in WWE would only have been as [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]] and signing would have ruined his life, implying that it did the same to him. Morgan encourages Paige to quit and return to her family for a happier life. She travels home for the Christmas break. Just before the match against her brother, Paige tells Zak she is leaving WWE. Angry that she is giving up the dream he failed to achieve himself, Zak goes [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|off-script]], defeats Paige and then tells their parents her plans to quit, devastating Ricky. After the family find Zak in a drunken bar fight, Paige admits that Morgan declined to sign Zak to protect him and he needs to focus on what is important in life; his family and coaching children who look up to him. Paige changes her mind after Zak berates her for giving up on their shared dream, and she returns to Florida, resuming her original hair color and skin tone.\n\nShe drastically improves in training, befriending and encouraging her fellow trainees. Zak returns to training his parents\u2019 students. Morgan brings the trainees to [[WrestleMania XXX]], where Paige is booked in a suite with The Rock and learns she will make her ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' debut the following night against [[WWE Divas Championship|WWE Divas Champion]] [[AJ Lee]], as recommended by Morgan. Paige makes her ''Raw'' debut and again freezes up, but Lee starts the match and unexpectedly puts the Divas Championship on the line. With her family watching on TV, Paige wins the match and the title, finally comfortable enough to say a promo, \"This is MY house!\".\n\nAn epilogue explains that Paige remains the youngest Divas Champion and was an early leader in the ongoing [[Women in WWE#Women's Evolution (2016\u2013present)|Women's Revolution]], that one of Zak's trainees, who was [[Visual impairment|blind]], became a wrestler, and pokes fun at The Rock's movie career and Rick selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the family business. The closing credits include footage from the family's 2012 documentary and Paige's debut match.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Florence Pugh]] as [[Paige (wrestler)|Saraya \"Paige\" Knight]], Zak's sister and Patrick and Julia's daughter.

Based on the 2012 documentary ''The Wrestlers: Fighting with My Family'' by Max Fisher, it depicts the [[WWE]] career of English [[professional wrestler]] [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], portrayed by [[Florence Pugh]]. The film also stars [[Lena Headey]], [[Nick Frost]], [[Jack Lowden]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Dwayne Johnson]], who also acts as a producer.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on 14 February 2019. It received positive reviews from critics, particularly for the performances of Pugh and Vaughn. It was also a commercial success, grossing $41.5 million worldwide against a budget of $11 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2002, in [[Norwich]], [[England]], 11-year-old [[Zak Zodiac|Zak Knight]] is engrossed by the [[WWE|WWF]] (now WWE) [[King of the Ring (2000)|King of the Ring]] pay-per-view event until his younger sister [[Paige (wrestler)|Saraya]] changes the channel to her favorite program, ''[[Charmed]]''. The siblings wrestle, urged on by their parents [[Ricky Knight|Rick]] and [[Sweet Saraya|Julia]]. Rick books the children for their first wrestling match where Saraya, initially reluctant to [[Intergender wrestling|wrestle a boy]], goes on to win as planned.\n\nAt 18, competing under the [[ring name]] \u201cBritani Knight\u201d, Saraya and her brother \u201cZak Zodiac\u201d help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially, ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. He finally agrees to a tryout before a [[WWE SmackDown|''SmackDown'']] taping at [[The O2 Arena]], and tells Saraya to find a different name as they \"already have a Britani\". The siblings receive advice from [[Dwayne Johnson]], and Saraya adopts the name Paige from [[Paige Matthews|her favorite character on ''Charmed'']].\n\nThe two try out with several other wrestlers and are all belittled by Morgan. He ultimately chooses Paige over the rest, despite her attempt to have Zak signed as well. With her brother's encouragement, Paige leaves for [[United States|America]] while Zak continues wrestling on the British [[independent circuit]], assisting his parents\u2019 wrestling school, and tending to his girlfriend and newborn son.\n\nArriving at [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] in [[Florida]], Paige has difficulty adjusting to the WWE style of entertainment \u2013 chiefly, the absence of intergender competition and the inexperience of her [[Women in WWE|fellow female trainees]] Jeri-Lynn, Kirsten, and Maddison. Paige struggles with performing promos and Morgan's constant belittlement. Morgan makes it clear to Zak that he will never be signed to WWE, and Zak falls into a [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Paige discovers her parents are selling merchandise of her likeness without her permission and have booked her in a match against Zak scheduled for her [[Christmas]] break.\n\nAt an NXT [[House show|live event]] and her in-ring debut, Paige is heckled by the crowd and freezes up, leaving the ring in tears. She decides to [[Hair coloring|bleach her hair blonde]] and [[Sunless tanning|spray tan]] to look more like her fellow trainees, which only causes more friction between them. After failing an [[obstacle course]], Paige lashes out at the trainees for [[gossip]]ing about her when they were actually discussing Kirsten, who has been away from her daughter in order to give her a better life.\n\nMorgan tells Paige that her brother's future in WWE would only have been as [[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]] and signing would have ruined his life, implying that it did the same to him. Morgan encourages Paige to quit and return to her family for a happier life. She travels home for the Christmas break. Just before the match against her brother, Paige tells Zak she is leaving WWE. Angry that she is giving up the dream he failed to achieve himself, Zak goes [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|off-script]], defeats Paige and then tells their parents her plans to quit, devastating Ricky. After the family find Zak in a drunken bar fight, Paige admits that Morgan declined to sign Zak to protect him and he needs to focus on what is important in life; his family and coaching children who look up to him. Paige changes her mind after Zak berates her for giving up on their shared dream, and she returns to Florida, resuming her original hair color and skin tone.\n\nShe drastically improves in training, befriending and encouraging her fellow trainees. Zak returns to training his parents\u2019 students. Morgan brings the trainees to [[WrestleMania XXX]], where Paige is booked in a suite with The Rock and learns she will make her ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' debut the following night against [[WWE Divas Championship|WWE Divas Champion]] [[AJ Lee]], as recommended by Morgan. Paige makes her ''Raw'' debut and again freezes up, but Lee starts the match and unexpectedly puts the Divas Championship on the line. With her family watching on TV, Paige wins the match and the title, finally comfortable enough to say a promo, \"This is MY house!\".\n\nAn epilogue explains that Paige remains the youngest Divas Champion and was an early leader in the ongoing [[Women in WWE#Women's Evolution (2016\u2013present)|Women's Revolution]], that one of Zak's trainees, who was [[Visual impairment|blind]], became a wrestler, and pokes fun at The Rock's movie career and Rick selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the family business. The closing credits include footage from the family's 2012 documentary and Paige's debut match.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Florence Pugh]] as [[Paige (wrestler)|Saraya \"Paige\" Knight]], Zak's sister and Patrick and Julia's daughter.

The Ridge is on the territory of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] and [[Raiymbek District|Raiymbek]] districts of the [[Almaty Region|Almaty region]] which falls within the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] and [[China]]. The total length of the Ridge is 310 km, 160 km of which lies in Kazakhstan. The width of the Ridge is about 40\u201350 km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan at 3,652 m.[2]\nThe Ridge is adjacent to the K\u00fcng\u00f6y Ala-Too Range in the west and the Narat Ridge in the east. The Northern slopes of the Ridge pass into the Ili Valley. Keen Ridge forms the southern border of Semirechye. \nThe Ridge is composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as effusions, [[granite]], and [[limestone]]. The slopes are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The Ridge has a [[permafrost]] zone but does not have glaciation or snowfields. It contains [[steppe]] and [[taiga]] forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, steppe bison remains have been found {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow is laid through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the Ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\nThe Keen ridge has a wide variety of flora. Research has found that the Ketmen ridge is home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. Eighty-four species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found.

The Ridge is on the territory of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] and [[Raiymbek District|Raiymbek]] districts of the [[Almaty Region|Almaty region]], falling within the area of the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] and [[China]]. The total length of the Ridge is 310 km, 160 km of which lies in Kazakhstan. The width of the Ridge is about 40\u201350 km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan at 3,652 m.[2]\nThe Ridge is adjacent to the K\u00fcng\u00f6y Ala-Too Range in the west and the Narat Ridge in the east. The Northern slopes of the Ridge pass into the Ili Valley. Keen Ridge forms the southern border of Semirechye. \nThe Ridge is composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as effusions, [[granite]], and [[limestone]]. The slopes are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The Ridge has a [[permafrost]] zone but does not have glaciation or snowfields. It contains [[steppe]] and [[taiga]] forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, steppe bison remains have been found {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow is laid through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the Ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\nThe Keen ridge has a wide variety of flora. Research has found that the Ketmen ridge is home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. Eighty-four species from 11 genera of rust fungi were found. The most abundant genera found were 48 species of Puccinia and 12 species of Uromyces {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Source and links ==\n* https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/Attraction_Review-g2350619-d15873720-Reviews-Ketmen_Ridge-Almaty_Region.html\n* \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 / \u0422. \u041f. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.). \u2014 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a: \u041e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, 2011. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-5-9523-0332-4}}\n* \u041a\u0435\u0442\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0442 // \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0410\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b: \u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b, 2005. \u2014 \u0422.
