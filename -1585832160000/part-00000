It is aimed at informing Christians about every country in the world in order to encourage the [[Christian Church|church]] to [[prayer|pray]] for the world and to engage the world in Christian mission. This resource is written from an [[evangelical Christian]] point of view, and the Operation World team is now led by Jason Mandryk and Molly Wall. \n\n''Operation World'' was on the list of the 50 most influential evangelical books in [[Christianity Today]] magazine. It is intended to mobilize the church to effective intercession and world mission and ultimately, to help the global Church fulfil the [[Great Commission]].\n\n''Operation World'' has been published in seven editions.

''Operation World'' has been translated into several other languages: Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, and simplified Chinese. Parts of ''Operation World'' have been translated into Arabic, Urdu, and Czech. The cumulative number of copies printed in all languages exceeds 2.5 million. In the missionary tradition of the Dorothea Mission and WEC International, the team behind the production of ''Operation World'' consists only of volunteers (i.e., no salaried staff). Currently Molly and Jason are the only full time volunteers in the Operation World team.\n\nThe 1,000-plus page prayer resource is also organized as a calendar-year daily prayer guide. Each 3- to 4-page daily section begins with basic information on a country\u2019s geography, demographics, population, literacy, economy, etc. ''Operation World'' then gives a breakdown of percentage of religions, Christian denominations, and missions groups, followed by points for prayer. These prayer points are directed toward the social, political, economic, cultural, and religious life of each nation, as well as life and activity of the existing Church in each country.\n\nThematically, ''Operation World'' begins with global issues and world missions, then narrows to cover the six continents before it settles into a country-by-country format, covering every nation and autonomous territory.\n\nData is gathered from sources including primary input from national Christian church leaders, missionaries, and researchers. A consultative process is used, eliciting input and response from nearly 2,000 such contacts in every part of the world. Information is also gathered from more than 200 periodicals and journals, the plethora of news agencies, websites of churches and ministries around the world, and more encyclopedic resources such as the World Christian Database<ref>http://www.worldchristiandatabase.org</ref>, the [[Ethnologue]]<ref>http://www.ethnologue.org/</ref>, and the [[Joshua Project]]. The ''Operation World'' database includes information on approximately 33,000 Christian denominations, 16 major religions, 1,200 missions agencies, and 16,000 fields of ministry.\n\nAdditional ''Operation World'' resources include the book in paperback, CD, DVD or ebook formats, individual country profiles and prayer maps and are all available from [http://www.operationworld.com InterVarsity Press].\n\nOther resources produced by the Operation World team include:\n\n''Pray for the World'', an abridged and [[simplified English]]{{dn|date=August 2019}} version of ''Operation World'', and was published in 2015 by IVP. ''Pray for the World'' was published for the purpose of greater engagement with those who may not be inclined to use a 1000+ page reference volume. It is easier to read for non-native English speakers, more affordable due to smaller size, and a more feasible project for translation. Thus far, it has been translated into Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Spanish, Portuguese, Urdu, Hindi, Russian, Arabic, and Amharic. \n\n''Window on the World'', the children's version of ''Operation World''. ''Window on the World'' began life as ''You Can Change the World'', written by Patrick Johnstone's late first wife, Jill and published in 1992.

[[AT&T]]'s [[text to speech]] program provided Moon Man's voice and was soon edited to block any racially derogatory epithets or swear words in an attempt to cull the number of remixes. McDonald's began removing existing Mac Tonight sculptures and animatronics from some of its restaurants in response to the widespread remixes, and [[YouTube]] began automatically striking down many Moon Man-related videos from 2007 to the present. Several videos were also [[DMCA]]-claimed and taken down by McDonald's from 2007\u20132008. Multiple [[change.org]] petitions were filed demanding YouTube cease removing the videos, the most recent of which from May 2015 having reaching over 1200 signatures. YouTube has since stopped taking Moon Man videos down unless they have been flagged by users.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Timothy|title=Rape, Murder, Violent Racism: The Weirdest McDonald's Ad Campaign Ever|url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/rape-murder-violent-racism-the-weirdest-mcdonalds-ad-1673970057|website=The Concourse|publisher=The Concourse|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Sega ===\nOn January 11, 2007, Goldberg revealed that [[Sega Europe]] had sent a [[cease and desist]] letter concerning the \"Sonic Says...\" fad, which features a clip from the [[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic animated series]].
