Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]. As a student, he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark [[Man Ray]] auction at [[Sotheby's]], London.\n\nIn 1995, Loughrey married Shannon Carragher and, together, they re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss]] 'Samitaur' building in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]], realized $129,000.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nAfter achieving the world record for an Eames design in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity was chosen by John & Marilyn Neuhart to auction works from their private collection in July 2000 \u2013 the first ever single-owner auction dedicated to the works of Charles and Ray Eames. On offer were custom designs, sculptures, photographs, drawings, and ephemera by the Eameses curated by the Neuharts, who worked in the Eames Office and authored ''Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames''. Also included was a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes \u2013 many of which are in permanent collections in public institutions. \n\nAcknowledging LAMA\u2019s swift ascent, Loughrey was included that year in ''Art & Auction'''s Power Issue.\n\nIn 2002, during the Loughreys\u2019 tenure directing [[Butterfield and Butterfield]]'s 20th Century Decorative Arts and Design department,  [[Playboy]] Enterprises selected Loughrey to conduct the first-ever auction of items from the magazine's archives, including fine art, photography, sculpture, drawings, and ephemera. That year, LAMA also organized the first auction dedicated to the collection of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd.\n\nIn 2003, Peter Loughrey joined [[PBS]]\u2019s [[Antiques Roadshow]] as an appraiser and continued to be featured on the program today until his passing in 2020. \n\nLAMA achieved two more world auction records in 2004, when works by [[George Nakashima]] sold for more than $100,000 \u2014 Nakashima remains a consistently featured LAMA artist today. The same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Loughrey to co-curate ''Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration''. Works by Italian designer, architect and artist Ponti continue to be regularly presented at LAMA sales.\n\nLoughrey also worked with ACME to co-curate another show in 2005, ''Dutch Design''. In May of that year, LAMA was the exclusive auctioneer of the entire contents of the [[Paul Laszlo]]-designed Hudspeth Residence. This was the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at auction at one time.\n\nLAMA established a new world record price for ''Marilyn (#28)'' by [[Andy Warhol]] at its June 3, 2007 Modern Art & Design Auction, where the work realized $144,000. Shortly after, [[Judy Chicago]]\u2019s ''Car Hood'' realized $288,000. \n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale, auctioning the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection.

Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]. As a student, he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark [[Man Ray]] auction at [[Sotheby's]], London.\n\nIn 1995, Loughrey married Shannon Carragher and, together, they re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss]] 'Samitaur' building in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]], realized $129,000.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nAfter achieving the world record for an Eames design in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity was chosen by John & Marilyn Neuhart to auction works from their private collection in July 2000 \u2013 the first ever single-owner auction dedicated to the works of Charles and Ray Eames. On offer were custom designs, sculptures, photographs, drawings, and ephemera by the Eameses curated by the Neuharts, who worked in the Eames Office and authored ''Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames''. Also included was a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes \u2013 many of which are in permanent collections in public institutions. \n\nAcknowledging LAMA\u2019s swift ascent, Loughrey was included that year in ''Art & Auction'''s Power Issue.\n\nIn 2002, during the Loughreys\u2019 tenure directing [[Butterfield and Butterfield]]'s 20th Century Decorative Arts and Design department,  [[Playboy]] Enterprises selected Loughrey to conduct the first-ever auction of items from the magazine's archives, including fine art, photography, sculpture, drawings, and ephemera. That year, LAMA also organized the first auction dedicated to the collection of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd.\n\nIn 2003, Peter Loughrey joined [[PBS]]\u2019s [[Antiques Roadshow]] as an appraiser and continued to be featured on the program today until his passing in 2020. \n\nLAMA achieved two more world auction records in 2004, when works by [[George Nakashima]] sold for more than $100,000 \u2014 Nakashima remains a consistently featured LAMA artist today. The same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Loughrey to co-curate ''Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration''. Works by Italian designer, architect and artist Ponti continue to be regularly presented at LAMA sales.\n\nLoughrey also worked with ACME to co-curate another show in 2005, ''Dutch Design''. In May of that year, LAMA was the exclusive auctioneer of the entire contents of the [[Paul Laszlo]]-designed Hudspeth Residence. This was the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at auction at one time.\n\nLAMA established a new world record price for ''Marilyn (#28)'' by [[Andy Warhol]] at its June 3, 2007 Modern Art & Design Auction, where the work realized $144,000. Shortly after, [[Judy Chicago]]\u2019s ''Car Hood'' realized $288,000. \n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale, auctioning the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!, and, in October, the Loughreys left their West Hollywood location for LAMA\u2019s current showroom in Van Nuys, California. The space was formerly home to Stan Winston Studio and features a skylight added to accommodate the construction of the tyrannosaurus Rex for the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.\n\n===2010 to 2020===\nLAMA celebrated its 25th anniversary with its October 22, 2017 Modern Art & Design Auction; the Top Lot was [[Roy Lichtenstein]]\u2019s ''Reverie'', which sold for $175,000.

The underlined letters appear in the word in their correct places, while the crossed-out letters do not appear, and each crossed-out letter corresponds to one part of the drawing. In this case, the secret word is \u201changman\u201d.]]\n'''Hangman''' is a [[Paper-and-pencil game|paper and pencil]] [[Guessing#Guessing games|guessing game]] for two or more players. One player thinks of a [[word]], [[phrase]] or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] within a certain number of guesses.\n\n==History==\n\nThough the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by [[Alice Gomme]] in 1894.  <ref>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41727/41727-h/41727-h.htm#GameI_50</ref>  This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.\n\n==Overview==\nThe word to guess is represented by a row of [[Dash (punctuation)|dashes]], representing each [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of the [[word]]. In most variants, [[proper noun]]s, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not allowed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man [[stick figure]] as a [[Tally marks|tally mark]].\n\nThe player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Classroom game of hangman.jpg|thumb|left|A classroom game of Hangman]]\nAs the name of the game suggests, the [[diagram]] is designed to look like a [[hanging]] man.

A common alternative for teachers is to draw an [[apple tree]] with ten apples, erasing or crossing out the [[apple]]s as the guesses are used up.\n\nThe exact nature of the diagram differs; some players draw the [[gallows]] before play and draw parts of the man's body (traditionally the [[head]], then the [[torso]], then the [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s one by one). Some players begin with no diagram at all, and drawing the individual elements of the gallows as part of the game, effectively giving the guessing players more chances. The amount of detail on the man can also vary, affecting the number of chances. Some players include a [[face]] on the head, either all at once or one feature at a time. Some players include beheading the head as the last chance by drawing a line at the neck.\n\nSome modifications to game play ([[house rule]]s) to increase the difficulty level are sometimes implemented, such as limiting guesses on high-frequency [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s. Another alternative is to give the definition of the word; this can be used to facilitate the learning of a [[foreign language]].\n\n==Strategy==\nThe fact that the twelve most commonly occurring letters in the [[English language]] are [[Etaoin shrdlu|e-t-a-o-i-n-s-h-r-d-l-u]] (from most to least), along with other [[Letter frequency|letter-frequency]] lists, are used by the guessing player to increase the odds when it is their turn to guess. On the other hand, the same lists can be used by the puzzle setter to stump their opponent by choosing a word that deliberately avoids common letters (e.g. ''rhythm'' or ''zephyr'') or one that contains rare letters (e.g. ''jazz'').\n\nAnother common strategy is to guess vowels first, as [[English language|English]] only has five vowels ([[a]], [[e]], [[i]], [[o]], and [[u]], while [[y]] may sometimes, but rarely, be used as a vowel) and [[English words without vowels|almost every word has at least one]].\n\nAccording to a 2010 study conducted by Jon McLoone for [[Wolfram Research]], the most difficult words to guess include ''jazz'', ''buzz'', ''hajj'', ''faff'', ''fizz'', ''fuzz'' and variations of these.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.wolfram.com/2010/08/13/25-best-hangman-words/|title=25 Best Hangman Words|last=McLoone|first=Jon|date=13 August 2010|publisher=[[Wolfram Research]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815092214/http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/08/13/25-best-hangman-words/|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=live|access-date=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Derivations==\nThe game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' is based on Hangman but with the addition of multiple-word puzzles, a [[roulette]]-styled wheel, and cash awards.\n\n[[Brazil]] also had a show in the 1960s and again from 2012\u20132013 called ''Let\u2019s Play Hangman'', hosted by the legendary [[Silvio Santos]].

These shows were also hosted by Santos.\n\nIn July 2017, the [[BBC]] introduced a game show of its own called ''[[Letterbox (game show)|Letterbox]]'', which is also based on Hangman.<ref>http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Letterbox</ref>\n\n==Example game==\nThe following example game illustrates a player trying to guess the word ''hangman'' using a strategy based solely on letter frequency.
