It was reported in November 2012 by Professor Alice Aursperg of the [[University of Vienna]], that a cock bird named Figaro was observed spontaneously shaping splinters of wood and small sticks in order to create [[Rake (tool)|rakes]] that were then utilized, enabling him to extend his reach and retrieve otherwise unavailable food items located upon the other side of his aviary mesh.<ref name=Auersperg>{{cite journal|last=Auersperg|first=Alice M.I.|first2=Birgit |last2=Szabo |first3=Auguste M.P. |last3=von Bayern |first4 = Alex | last4=Kacelnik|title=Spontaneous innovation in tool manufacture and use in a Goffin's cockatoo|journal=Current Biology|date=6 November 2012|volume=22|issue=21|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.002 |pages=R903\u2013R904 |pmid=23137681|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=Warwicker>{{cite web|last=Warwicker|first=Michelle|title=Cockatoo shows tool-making skills|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/20170195|publisher=BBC Nature|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the results of a joint study involving scientists from [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[Max Planck Institute]], again involving the Tanimbar corellas of the Vienna Goffin Lab, were announced. It was discovered that the birds possessed the ability to solve complex mechanical problems, in one case spontaneously working out how to open a five-part locking mechanism in sequence to retrieve a food item. The corellas were able to very quickly adapt their behaviour and again open the lock when the mechanism sections were modified or re-ordered, demonstrating an apparent concept of working towards a particular goal and knowledge of the way in which physical objects act upon each other \u2013 rather than merely an ability to repeat a learned sequence of actions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cockatoos 'Pick' Puzzle Box Locks: Cockatoos Show Technical Intelligence On a Five-Lock Problem|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130704095123.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nA later experiment also conducted at the Vienna Goffin Lab by Prof. Auersperg and her team broadly adapted the [[Stanford marshmallow experiment]] for the Tanimbar corella, to investigate whether the birds were capable of [[self-control]] and of anticipating a delayed gain. The corellas were given the opportunity to exchange a favoured food item (in this case a [[pecan]] nut) for an even more desirable nut (a [[cashew]]), if they were only able to hold the first nut for a period of time and then return it to the human researcher's hand uneaten \u2013 at which point the nuts would be exchanged. Although pecan nuts are normally consumed instantly, it was discovered that the corellas could resist the temptation to eat the nut for periods of time for up to 80 seconds once aware that a cashew was also on offer. This behaviour (having also previously been demonstrated in [[corvid]]s) further disproves the previous belief that birds are incapable of self-control.<ref name=sciencedaily>{{cite web|title=Doing Business With a Parrot: Self-Control Observed in Cockatoos|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130313112426.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> Further work by Auersperg's team, published in November 2018, showed that the corellas would cut cardboard to length with their beak, to obtain a reward, but seemed unable to change the width of the tools.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205429 Tool making cockatoos adjust the lengths but not the widths of their tools to function], A.

Many new bird owners are not aware of the time and money a cockatoo demands and pet birds are often passed from one owner to the next or relinquished to [[animal shelter]]s.\n\nTanimbar corella chicks make a repetitive soft howling/screeching noise (producer calls) when they are hungry.\n\nIn the UK their sale is controlled as they are classified as a rare species. Each bird must have an official certificate to prove that it was captive-bred and not imported.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n==Intelligence==\n[[Tool use by animals|Tool use behaviour]] has been observed in the Tanimbar corella in captivity. It was reported in November 2012 by Professor Alice Aursperg of the [[University of Vienna]], that a cock bird named Figaro was observed spontaneously shaping splinters of wood and small sticks in order to create [[Rake (tool)|rakes]] that were then utilized, enabling him to extend his reach and retrieve otherwise unavailable food items located upon the other side of his aviary mesh.<ref name=Auersperg>{{cite journal|last=Auersperg|first=Alice M.I.|first2=Birgit |last2=Szabo |first3=Auguste M.P. |last3=von Bayern |first4 = Alex | last4=Kacelnik|title=Spontaneous innovation in tool manufacture and use in a Goffin's cockatoo|journal=Current Biology|date=6 November 2012|volume=22|issue=21|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.002 |pages=R903\u2013R904 |pmid=23137681|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=Warwicker>{{cite web|last=Warwicker|first=Michelle|title=Cockatoo shows tool-making skills|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/20170195|publisher=BBC Nature|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the results of a joint study involving scientists from [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[Max Planck Institute]], again involving the Tanimbar corellas of the Vienna Goffin Lab, were announced. It was discovered that the birds possessed the ability to solve complex mechanical problems, in one case spontaneously working out how to open a five-part locking mechanism in sequence to retrieve a food item. The corellas were able to very quickly adapt their behaviour and again open the lock when the mechanism sections were modified or re-ordered, demonstrating an apparent concept of working towards a particular goal and knowledge of the way in which physical objects act upon each other \u2013 rather than merely an ability to repeat a learned sequence of actions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cockatoos 'Pick' Puzzle Box Locks: Cockatoos Show Technical Intelligence On a Five-Lock Problem|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130704095123.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nA later experiment also conducted at the Vienna Goffin Lab by Prof. Auersperg and her team broadly adapted the [[Stanford marshmallow experiment]] for the Tanimbar corella, to investigate whether the birds were capable of [[self-control]] and of anticipating a delayed gain. The corellas were given the opportunity to exchange a favoured food item (in this case a [[pecan]] nut) for an even more desirable nut (a [[cashew]]), if they were only able to hold the first nut for a period of time and then return it to the human researcher's hand uneaten \u2013 at which point the nuts would be exchanged. Although pecan nuts are normally consumed instantly, it was discovered that the corellas could resist the temptation to eat the nut for periods of time for up to 80 seconds once aware that a cashew was also on offer. This behaviour (having also previously been demonstrated in [[corvid]]s) further disproves the previous belief that birds are incapable of self-control.<ref name=sciencedaily>{{cite web|title=Doing Business With a Parrot: Self-Control Observed in Cockatoos|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130313112426.htm|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> Further work by Auersperg's team, published in November 2018, showed that the corellas would cut cardboard to length with their beak, to obtain a reward, but seemed unable to change the width of the tools.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205429 Tool making cockatoos adjust the lengths but not the widths of their tools to function], A.
