Some focus on [[porting]] games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.\n\nMost [[video game publisher]]s maintain development studios (such as [[Electronic Arts]]'s [[EA Canada]], [[Square Enix]]'s studios, [[Activision]]'s [[Radical Entertainment]], [[Nintendo EAD]] and Sony's [[Polyphony Digital]] and [[Naughty Dog]]). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as \"publishers\" rather than \"developers\". Developers may be private as well (such as how [[Bungie]] was, the company which developed the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]] exclusive to Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===First-party developer===\nIn the [[video game industry]], a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a [[video game console]] and develops exclusively for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as [[Nintendo]]), have a specific division name (such as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[Polyphony Digital]]) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as [[Rare (company)|Rare]] or [[Naughty Dog]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Shahed |title=Naughty Dog discusses being acquired by Sony|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-discusses-being-acquired-by-sony/1100-2677654/|website=GameSpot}}</ref> Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge [[financial investment]] on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.<ref name=NGen30>{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|pages=39\u201340 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n40}}</ref> However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.<ref name=NGen30/>\n\n===Second-party developer===\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Second Party|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=40}}</ref> As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.<ref name=NGen30/> These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are [[Insomniac Games]] (originally a 2nd party for Sony), [[Remedy Entertainment]] (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and [[Game Freak]] (a 2nd party for Nintendo).\n\n===Third-party developers===\n{{Anchor|Third-party developers|3rd-party developers}}\n{{see also|Third-party software component}}\n\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's [[Game design|design]] and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.\n\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a [[contract]], which specifies a list of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on [[royalties]]. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\n\nA common [[exit strategy]] for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\n\n[[Activision]] in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,<ref name=\"mj19821226\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3635%2C1989311 | title=Stream of video games is endless | work=Milwaukee Journal | date=1982-12-26 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | pages=Business 1}}</ref> where the term \"second-party\" originally referred to the consumers.\n\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired [[Raven Software|Raven]] (1997); [[Neversoft]] (1999), which merged with [[Infinity Ward]] in 2014; [[Z-Axis]] (2001); [[Treyarch]] (2001); [[Luxoflux]] (2002); [[Shaba Games|Shaba]] (2002); [[Infinity Ward]] (2003) and [[Vicarious Visions]] (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\n\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a [[database]], [[Voice over IP]], or add-in [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software; this is also known as [[middleware]]. Examples of this include [[SpeedTree]] and [[Havok (software)|Havoc]].\n\n===Indie game developers===\n{{See also|Indie game|Independent video game development}}\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the [[Internet]] and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.\n\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130449/the_end_game_how_top_developers_.php</ref>\n\n==Quality of life==\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire.

The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts [[Workforce|labor]] to the industry, creating a competitive [[labor market]] which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees. Industry communities, such as the [[International Game Developers Association]] (IGDA), are conducting increasing discussions about the problem; they are concerned that working conditions in the industry cause significant deterioration in its employees' quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php |title = Why Crunch Mode Doesn't Work: Six Lessons|website = [[IGDA]]|last = Robinson|first = Evan|date = 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://push.cx/2009/the-game-industry|title = The Game Industry |website= Push.cox|last = Harkins|first = Peter Bhat|date = 5 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===\"Crunch time\"===\n{{anchor|Crunch time}}\nSome video game developers (such as [[Electronic Arts]]) have been accused of the excessive invocation of \"crunch time\".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/no-fun-for-game-developers/|title = No fun for game developers?|work= [[CNet News]]|last = Frauenheim|first =Ed|date = 11 November 2004}}</ref> \"Crunch time\" is the point at which the team is thought to be failing to achieve milestones needed to launch a game on schedule.

First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as [[Nintendo]]), have a specific division name (such as [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony's]] [[Polyphony Digital]]) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as [[Rare (company)|Rare]] or [[Naughty Dog]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Shahed |title=Naughty Dog discusses being acquired by Sony|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-discusses-being-acquired-by-sony/1100-2677654/|website=GameSpot}}</ref> Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge [[financial investment]] on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.<ref name=NGen30>{{cite magazine |title=Is Your Favorite Game Company Ripping You Off? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=30|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|pages=39\u201340 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n40}}</ref> However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.<ref name=NGen30/>\n\n===Second-party developer===\nSecond-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Second Party|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=40}}</ref> As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.<ref name=NGen30/> These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are [[Insomniac Games]] (originally a 2nd party for Sony), [[Remedy Entertainment]] (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and [[Game Freak]] (a 2nd party for Nintendo).\n\n===Third-party developers===\n{{Anchor|Third-party developers|3rd-party developers}}\n{{see also|Third-party software component}}\n\nA third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's [[Game design|design]] and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.\n\nThe business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a [[contract]], which specifies a list of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on [[royalties]]. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.\n\nA common [[exit strategy]] for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.\n\n[[Activision]] in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,<ref name=\"mj19821226\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QX8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3635%2C1989311 | title=Stream of video games is endless | work=Milwaukee Journal | date=1982-12-26 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | pages=Business 1}}</ref> where the term \"second-party\" originally referred to the consumers.\n\nIn recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically \"in-house\", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired [[Raven Software|Raven]] (1997); [[Neversoft]] (1999), which merged with [[Infinity Ward]] in 2014; [[Z-Axis]] (2001); [[Treyarch]] (2001); [[Luxoflux]] (2002); [[Shaba Games|Shaba]] (2002); [[Infinity Ward]] (2003) and [[Vicarious Visions]] (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.\n\nA developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a [[database]], [[Voice over IP]], or add-in [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software; this is also known as [[middleware]]. Examples of this include [[SpeedTree]] and [[Havok (software)|Havoc]].\n\n===Indie game developers===\n{{See also|Indie game|Independent video game development}}\nIndependents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the [[Internet]] and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.\n\nOther indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).<ref>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130449/the_end_game_how_top_developers_.php</ref>\n\n==Quality of life==\nVideo game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire.

The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts [[Workforce|labor]] to the industry, creating a competitive [[labor market]] which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees.

But the boyfriend manages to kill him and dumps the body in a nearby lake, but then needs the car keys from the pocket of the body to get rid of a telltale car. The wife has had a number of terrible nightmares that her husband comes back from the dead to get revenge on her and when the door creaks open she blasts the figure behind it only to find she has killed her boyfriend.

It is even referred to as '''Coringa''' by the [[East India Company|Britishers]] because of the proximity of its [[Port|Sea Port]] to the [[Koringa River|river Koringa]].\n\nThe [[British East India Company]] also called it '''Cocanada''' when they established the first Canadian Baptist Mission. After [[Independence of India|Independence]], it finally got the name '''Kakinada'''.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance.

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river.

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The [[ballad]] evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort [[John Lennon]]'s son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]]. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a [[Coda (music)|coda]] featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on [[eight-track recording]] equipment. The sessions took place at [[Trident Studios]] in central London, midway through the recording of the group's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and [[George Harrison]] over the song's guitar part. [[Ringo Starr]] later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] and first aired on [[David Frost]]'s UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\n\nAt more than seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single ever to top the British charts.{{sfn|Lowry|2002|p=44}} Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite magazine|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2 August 2012 |accessdate= 9 August 2013 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archivedate= 10 July 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref> McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's death in 1980]], leading audiences in singing the coda.

Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ''pain''{{'}}).\"{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=252}} At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na \u2026\"), supported by an electric guitar fill,{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=194}} before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=253}}\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song's double [[plagal cadence]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=192}} During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out.{{refn|group=nb|Author [[John Kruth]] writes that McCartney might have taken the idea for the closing refrain from [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]]' 1965 hit \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\", the main [[Hook (music)|hook]] of which is a series of \"extended 'nah nah nah nah nahs'\". This band, whom McCartney nicknamed \"the Nah Nah Boys\", were his choice for the Beatles' support act on their [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|1965 US tour]].{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=22\u201323}}}} In his analysis of the composition, musicologist [[Alan W.

band [[the Beatles]] that was released as a non-album single in August 1968. It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to the [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] partnership. The single was the Beatles' first release on their [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label and one of the \"First Four\" singles by Apple's roster of artists, marking the label's public launch. \"Hey Jude\" was a number-one hit in many countries around the world and became the year's top-selling single in the UK, the US, Australia and Canada. Its nine-week run at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] tied the all-time record in 1968 for the longest run at the top of the US charts. It has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on music critics' lists of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nThe writing and recording of \"Hey Jude\" coincided with a period of upheaval in the Beatles. The [[ballad]] evolved from \"Hey Jules\", a song McCartney wrote to comfort [[John Lennon]]'s son, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], after Lennon had left his wife for the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]]. The lyrics espouse a positive outlook on a sad situation, while also encouraging \"Jude\" to pursue his opportunities to find love. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a [[Coda (music)|coda]] featuring a \"Na-na-na na\" refrain that lasts for over four minutes.\n\n\"Hey Jude\" was the first Beatles song to be recorded on [[eight-track recording]] equipment. The sessions took place at [[Trident Studios]] in central London, midway through the recording of the group's [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled double album]] (also known as the \"White Album\"), and led to an argument between McCartney and [[George Harrison]] over the song's guitar part. [[Ringo Starr]] later left the band only to return shortly before they filmed the promotional clip for the single. The clip was directed by [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] and first aired on [[David Frost]]'s UK television show. Contrasting with the problems afflicting the band, this performance captured the song's theme of optimism and togetherness by featuring the studio audience joining the Beatles as they sang the coda.\n\nAt more than seven minutes in length, \"Hey Jude\" was the longest single ever to top the British charts.{{sfn|Lowry|2002|p=44}} Its arrangement and extended coda encouraged many imitative works through to the early 1970s. In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine named it the 10th \"biggest\" song of all time in terms of chart success.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite magazine|first= Fred |last= Bronson |title= Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2 August 2012 |accessdate= 9 August 2013 |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170710144317/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=9 |archivedate= 10 July 2017 |url-status= live}}</ref> McCartney has continued to perform \"Hey Jude\" in concert since [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon's death in 1980]], leading audiences in singing the coda.

Tim Riley writes that, with the \"restrained tom-tom and cymbal fill\" that introduces the drum part, \"the piano shifts downward to add a flat seventh to the tonic chord, making the downbeat of the bridge the point of arrival ('And any time you feel the ''pain''{{'}}).\"{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=252}} At the end of each bridge, McCartney sings a brief phrase (\"Na-na-na na \u2026\"), supported by an electric guitar fill,{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=194}} before playing a piano fill that leads to the next verse. According to Riley, this vocal phrase serves to \"reorient the harmony for the verse as the piano figure turns upside down into a vocal aside\". Additional musical details, such as tambourine on the third verse and subtle harmonies accompanying the lead vocal, are added to sustain interest throughout the four-verse, two-bridge song.{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=253}}\n\nThe verse-bridge structure persists for approximately three minutes, after which the band leads into a four-minute-long coda, consisting of nineteen rounds of the song's double [[plagal cadence]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=192}} During this coda, the rest of the band, backed by an orchestra that also provides backing vocals, repeats the phrase \"Na-na-na na\" followed by the words \"hey Jude\" until the song gradually fades out.{{refn|group=nb|Author [[John Kruth]] writes that McCartney might have taken the idea for the closing refrain from [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]]' 1965 hit \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\", the main [[Hook (music)|hook]] of which is a series of \"extended 'nah nah nah nah nahs'\". This band, whom McCartney nicknamed \"the Nah Nah Boys\", were his choice for the Beatles' support act on their [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|1965 US tour]].{{sfn|Kruth|2015|pp=22\u201323}}}} In his analysis of the composition, musicologist [[Alan W.

In Riley's estimation, the song \"becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda\".{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=255}}\n\n==Release==\n{{quote box|quote=[The Beatles] are confident and cheerful and the human condition will be thrilled by the coming results of their willing and enduring Beatle bondage \u2026 they will give all of us new wonders to soothe our pain.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=49, 359}}|source=\u2013 [[Derek Taylor]], \"Hey Jude\" press release, August 1968|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\"Hey Jude\" was released on 26 August 1968 in the United States and 30 August in the United Kingdom,{{sfn|Castleman|Podrazik|1976|pp=67\u201368}} backed with \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of a 7-inch single.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}} It was one of four singles issued simultaneously to launch Apple Records \u2013 the others being Mary Hopkin's \"[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]\", Jackie Lomax's \"[[Sour Milk Sea]]\", and the Black Dyke Mills Band's \"Thingumybob\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=306}} In advance of the release date, Apple declared 11\u201318 August to be \"National Apple Week\" in the UK,{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=306}}<ref>Black, Johnny. \"A Slice of History\".

Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka conceals his country from the outside world. He sells off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] finds his way to Wakanda and covers up his work on a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaue kills T'Chaka, only to see his \"sound blaster\" turned on him by a grieving teenaged T'Challa.

In real life, this area is actually a disputed border region known as the [[Ilemi Triangle]], claimed by each of these countries. The ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' film further established that, in keeping with this map location, it is a landlocked country in the central mountains far from the coasts. Impassable mountains and jungles around its borders have helped Wakanda isolate itself from outsiders. Internally, Wakanda consists of lush river valleys, mountain ranges rich in natural resources, and a fabulous capital city that integrates space-age technology with traditional designs.\n\n* Wakanda appears prominently in the 2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', which further expands on its background and culture. The film establishes that, as in the comics, the Black Panther's super-strength comes from consuming the \"heart-shaped herb\", stating that it is local vegetation that was mutated over millions of years of exposure to Vibranium. Wakanda consists of five tribes, four of which were united under the rule of the first Black Panther 10,000 years ago. As in the comics, the four tribes (The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, and the Border tribe<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |title=Teen Vogue, Black Panther |access-date=2018-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219151110/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |archive-date=2018-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>) worship Bast, the panther god, amongst others, and also have a strong spiritual tradition of ancestor worship. The River Tribe wear green clothes made from crocodile skin and some males have a [[lip plate]] on them. The Mining Tribe are in charge of the Vibranium that is mined, stored, and utilized. The Merchant Tribe are responsible for trades and crafts of art, clothing and pieces of art where they also wear veils during a trade to maintain anonymity. The Border Tribe reside on the mountainous borders of Wakanda posing as farmers in order to deceive foreigners of Wakanda's wealth as well as their talent of breeding [[white rhinoceros]] even for battle. The fifth tribe are the Jabari, who follow the white gorilla cult (of the god [[Hanuman]]) \u2013 they are staunch traditionalists who live isolated up in the mountains. While considered part of Wakanda, the Black Panther's hold over the Jabari is tenuous; during the film, their leader [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]] rejects T'Challa as a worthy heir to the throne during his coronation, and challenges him to ceremonial combat to claim it for himself. The lords of each tribe sit on the king's councils, and after the Mountain tribe assists T'Challa in his overthrow of the usurper, [[Erik Killmonger|N'Jadaka aka Erik Kilmonger]], to take back the throne, M'Baku is also granted a seat on that council in recognition of his loyalty. The four main tribes of Wakanda speak a version of the [[Xhosa language]], while the Jabari speak an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] dialect.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> The opening animated sequence explains Wakanda was aware that the outside world was becoming increasingly chaotic, throughout the various atrocities of history such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the [[Colonisation of Africa]] by European powers, [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The Black Panthers of the past, however, were devoted to defending their own country and did not interfere, instead choosing to hide Wakanda from the world - fearing that if they became involved and revealed themselves, it would eventually lead outsiders to try to invade Wakanda itself. Wakanda passes itself off as a small, poor Third World nation of humble herdsmen, using an advanced holographic projection shroud around its borders to hide the advanced technological civilization within. A core tension of the film's narrative is that the new Black Panther, T'Challa, is torn between his loyalty to hide and defend Wakanda as its king, and his own conscience to help the faltering world beyond its borders. Erik Killmonger then arrives in Wakanda to try to seize the throne - mirroring T'Challa's desire to end Wakanda's isolationism, but by conquering the outside world using Wakanda's advanced technologies and weapons. Ultimately, T'Challa defeats Killmonger and decides to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world during an address at the [[United Nations]]. The film's popularity led to a trend among athletes and celebrities around the world to throw up \"Wakanda Forever\" salutes after their victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/the-black-panther-Wakanda-forever-symbol-is-showing-up-everywhere|title=The \"Wakanda Forever\" Symbol Is Showing Up Everywhere|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|work=Vanities|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Director [[Ryan Coogler]] stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by the southern African kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"TimesLive\" /><ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Basotho blanket]]s also became more known as a result of the film and its basis on Lesotho.<ref>https://www.businessinsider.co.za/black-panther-has-not-real-effect-on-the-south-african-sale-of-basotho-blankts-2018-3</ref>\n\n* Wakanda appears in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.

It was unearthed a generation before the events of the present day. T'Challa, the current Black Panther, is the son of T'Chaka, the Black Panther before him and a descendant of Bashenga.  Knowing that others would attempt to manipulate and dominate Wakanda for this rare and valuable resource, T'Chaka conceals his country from the outside world. He sells off minute amounts of the valuable vibranium while surreptitiously sending the country's best scholars to study abroad, consequently turning Wakanda into one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. Eventually, however, the explorer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] finds his way to Wakanda and covers up his work on a vibranium-powered, sound-based weapon. When exposed, Klaue kills T'Chaka, only to see his \"sound blaster\" turned on him by a grieving teenaged T'Challa.

[[Digital Spy]].</ref> In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its location was established in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' when it was shown on a map: at the northern end of Lake Turkana, at a fictional point bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda, and Kenya. In real life, this area is actually a disputed border region known as the [[Ilemi Triangle]], claimed by each of these countries. The ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' film further established that, in keeping with this map location, it is a landlocked country in the central mountains far from the coasts. Impassable mountains and jungles around its borders have helped Wakanda isolate itself from outsiders. Internally, Wakanda consists of lush river valleys, mountain ranges rich in natural resources, and a fabulous capital city that integrates space-age technology with traditional designs.\n\n* Wakanda appears prominently in the 2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', which further expands on its background and culture. The film establishes that, as in the comics, the Black Panther's super-strength comes from consuming the \"heart-shaped herb\", stating that it is local vegetation that was mutated over millions of years of exposure to Vibranium. Wakanda consists of five tribes, four of which were united under the rule of the first Black Panther 10,000 years ago. As in the comics, the four tribes (The River tribe, the Mining tribe, the Merchant tribe, and the Border tribe<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |title=Teen Vogue, Black Panther |access-date=2018-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219151110/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-panther-beauty-looks-express-african-pride-afrofuturism |archive-date=2018-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>) worship Bast, the panther god, amongst others, and also have a strong spiritual tradition of ancestor worship. The River Tribe wear green clothes made from crocodile skin and some males have a [[lip plate]] on them. The Mining Tribe are in charge of the Vibranium that is mined, stored, and utilized. The Merchant Tribe are responsible for trades and crafts of art, clothing and pieces of art where they also wear veils during a trade to maintain anonymity. The Border Tribe reside on the mountainous borders of Wakanda posing as farmers in order to deceive foreigners of Wakanda's wealth as well as their talent of breeding [[white rhinoceros]] even for battle. The fifth tribe are the Jabari, who follow the white gorilla cult (of the god [[Hanuman]]) \u2013 they are staunch traditionalists who live isolated up in the mountains. While considered part of Wakanda, the Black Panther's hold over the Jabari is tenuous; during the film, their leader [[Man-Ape|M'Baku]] rejects T'Challa as a worthy heir to the throne during his coronation, and challenges him to ceremonial combat to claim it for himself. The lords of each tribe sit on the king's councils, and after the Mountain tribe assists T'Challa in his overthrow of the usurper, [[Erik Killmonger|N'Jadaka aka Erik Kilmonger]], to take back the throne, M'Baku is also granted a seat on that council in recognition of his loyalty. The four main tribes of Wakanda speak a version of the [[Xhosa language]], while the Jabari speak an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] dialect.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> The opening animated sequence explains Wakanda was aware that the outside world was becoming increasingly chaotic, throughout the various atrocities of history such as the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the [[Colonisation of Africa]] by European powers, [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The Black Panthers of the past, however, were devoted to defending their own country and did not interfere, instead choosing to hide Wakanda from the world - fearing that if they became involved and revealed themselves, it would eventually lead outsiders to try to invade Wakanda itself. Wakanda passes itself off as a small, poor Third World nation of humble herdsmen, using an advanced holographic projection shroud around its borders to hide the advanced technological civilization within. A core tension of the film's narrative is that the new Black Panther, T'Challa, is torn between his loyalty to hide and defend Wakanda as its king, and his own conscience to help the faltering world beyond its borders. Erik Killmonger then arrives in Wakanda to try to seize the throne - mirroring T'Challa's desire to end Wakanda's isolationism, but by conquering the outside world using Wakanda's advanced technologies and weapons. Ultimately, T'Challa defeats Killmonger and decides to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world during an address at the [[United Nations]]. The film's popularity led to a trend among athletes and celebrities around the world to throw up \"Wakanda Forever\" salutes after their victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/the-black-panther-Wakanda-forever-symbol-is-showing-up-everywhere|title=The \"Wakanda Forever\" Symbol Is Showing Up Everywhere|last=Weaver|first=Hilary|work=Vanities|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Director [[Ryan Coogler]] stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by the southern African kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"TimesLive\" /><ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Basotho blanket]]s also became more known as a result of the film and its basis on Lesotho.<ref>https://www.businessinsider.co.za/black-panther-has-not-real-effect-on-the-south-african-sale-of-basotho-blankts-2018-3</ref>\n\n* Wakanda appears in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.

Porter]] and his student Thomas Ashford at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]]. In January 1962 they reported an increased number of lysosomes in rat liver cells after the addition of [[glucagon]], and that some displaced lysosomes towards the centre of the cell contained other cell organelles such as [[mitochondria]]. They called this [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] after [[Christian de Duve]] and [[Alex B. Novikoff]]. However Porter and Ashford wrongly interpreted their data as lysosome formation (ignoring the pre-existing organelles). Lysosomes could not be cell organelles, but part of [[cytoplasm]] such as [[mitochondria]], and that [[hydrolytic enzymes]] were produced by microbodies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashford TP, Porter KR | title = Cytoplasmic components in hepatic cell lysosomes | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 198\u2013202 | date = January 1962 | pmid = 13862833 | pmc = 2106008 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.12.1.198 }}</ref> In 1963 Hruban, Spargo and colleagues published a detailed ultrastructural description of \"focal cytoplasmic degradation,\" which referenced a 1955 German study of injury-induced sequestration.

Morphological and histochemical studies so far did not prove a causative relationship between the autophagic process and cell death. In fact, there have recently been strong arguments that autophagic activity in dying cells might actually be a survival mechanism.<ref name=tavassoly>{{cite book|last1=Tavassoly|first1=Iman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Dynamics of Cell Fate Decision Mediated by the Interplay of Autophagy and Apoptosis in Cancer Cells|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-14962-2|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-14962-2 |series=Springer Theses }}</ref><ref name=Shimizu2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsujimoto Y, Shimizu S | title = Another way to die: autophagic programmed cell death | journal = Cell Death and Differentiation | volume = 12 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 1528\u201334 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16247500 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401777 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Studies of the metamorphosis of insects have shown cells undergoing a form of PCD that appears distinct from other forms; these have been proposed as examples of autophagic cell death.<ref name=Osborne1993>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz LM, Smith SW, Jones ME, Osborne BA | title = Do all programmed cell deaths occur via apoptosis? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 980\u20134 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 8430112 | pmc = 45794 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.3.980 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...90..980S }}</ref> Recent pharmacological and biochemical studies have proposed that survival and lethal autophagy can be distinguished by the type and degree of regulatory signaling during stress particularly after viral infection.<ref name=Datan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Datan E, Shirazian A, Benjamin S, Matassov D, Tinari A, Malorni W, Lockshin RA, Garcia-Sastre A, Zakeri Z | title = mTOR/p70S6K signaling distinguishes routine, maintenance-level autophagy from autophagic cell death during influenza A infection | journal = Virology | volume = 452\u2013453 | issue = March 2014 | pages = 175\u2013190 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24606695 | pmc = 4005847 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.008 }}</ref> Although promising, these findings have not been examined in non-viral systems.\n\n==Exercise==\nAutophagy is essential for basal [[homeostasis]]; it is also extremely important in maintaining [[muscle]] homeostasis during physical exercise.<ref name=He2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = He C, Bassik MC, Moresi V, Sun K, Wei Y, Zou Z, An Z, Loh J, Fisher J, Sun Q, Korsmeyer S, Packer M, May HI, Hill JA, Virgin HW, Gilpin C, Xiao G, Bassel-Duby R, Scherer PE, Levine B | title = Exercise-induced BCL2-regulated autophagy is required for muscle glucose homeostasis | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7382 | pages = 511\u20135 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258505 | pmc = 3518436 | doi = 10.1038/nature10758 | displayauthors = etal | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..511H }}</ref><ref name=Klionsky2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair U, Klionsky DJ | title = Activation of autophagy is required for muscle homeostasis during physical exercise | journal = Autophagy | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 1405\u20136 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22082869 | pmc = 3288013 | doi = 10.4161/auto.7.12.18315 }}</ref> Autophagy at the molecular level is only partially understood.

The second strategy is to inhibit autophagy and thus induce apoptosis.<ref name=\"Jin\" />\n\nThe first strategy has been tested by looking at dose-response anti-tumor effects during autophagy-induced therapies.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by inclusions of a protein called alpha-synuclien (Lewy bodies) in affected neurons that cells cannot break down. Deregulation of the autophagy pathway and mutation of alleles regulating autophagy are believed to cause neurodegenerative diseases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Autophagy is essential for neuronal survival.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Without efficient autophagy, neurons gather ubiquitinated protein aggregates and degrade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Ubiquitinated proteins are proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin to get degraded. Mutations of synuclien alleles lead to lysosome pH increase and hydrolase inhibition. As a result, lysosomes degradative capacity is decreased. There are several genetic mutations implicated in the disease, including loss of function [[PINK1]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Valente EM, Abou-Sleiman PM, Caputo V, Muqit MM, Harvey K, Gispert S, Ali Z, Del Turco D, Bentivoglio AR, Healy DG, Albanese A, Nussbaum R, Gonz\u00e1lez-Maldonado R, Deller T, Salvi S, Cortelli P, Gilks WP, Latchman DS, Harvey RJ, Dallapiccola B, Auburger G, Wood NW | title = Hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease caused by mutations in PINK1 | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5674 | pages = 1158\u201360 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15087508 | doi = 10.1126/science.1096284 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1158V }}</ref> and [[Parkin (ligase)|Parkin]].<ref name = \"Kitada_1998\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitada T, Asakawa S, Hattori N, Matsumine H, Yamamura Y, Minoshima S, Yokochi M, Mizuno Y, Shimizu N | title = Mutations in the parkin gene cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6676 | pages = 605\u20138 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9560156 | doi = 10.1038/33416 | bibcode = 1998Natur.392..605K }}</ref> Loss of function in these genes can lead to damaged mitochondrial accumulation and protein aggregates than can lead to cellular degeneration.
