{"title_page": "Elizabeth Alkin", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n'''Elizabeth Alkin''' ({{circa}} 1600 \u2013 {{circa}} 1655){{efn|Although Maureen Bell, writing for the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', puts the date of death as 1655,{{sfn|Bell|2004}} the historians [[Diane Purkiss]] and Marcus Nevitt separately estimate the date as 1654.{{sfn|Purkiss|2007|p=410}}{{sfn|Nevitt|2006|p=93}}}} was a publisher, nurse and spy for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian forces]] during the [[English Civil War]]. Among the many derogatory names she was called by royalist sympathisers, that of '''Parliament Joan''' is one by which she is also commonly known.{{sfn|Bell|2004}}\n\n==Background and Civil War activities==\nNothing is known of Alkin until 1645; because of comments of her age made later in life, her date of birth is taken to be around 1600.{{sfn|Bell|2004}} She was the wife of Francis Alkin, a spy for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] who was hanged early in the [[English Civil War]] by [[Cavalier|royalist forces]] for his activities.{{sfn|Purkiss|2007|p=410}} She was the mother of three children.{{sfn|Bell|2004}}\n\nIn 1645 Alkin was employed by the earl of Essex, [[William Waller|Sir William Waller]], to be a spy for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s. She received a similar commission from [[Thomas Fairfax|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] two years later.{{sfn|Bell|2004}} Parliamentary records show that in 1645 she received payment from the [[Committee for the Advance of Money]] for uncovering the activities of George Mynnes, a Surrey-based iron merchant, who was supplying metal to the royalist forces.{{sfn|Nevitt|2006|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nIn the seventeenth century, daily news was published in [[newsbook]]s which tended to be small eight-page publications, the forerunners of newspapers. They were usually sold on the street by what the historian Bob Clarke describes as \"semi-destitute female hawkers, known as Mercury Women\".{{sfn|Clarke|2004|pp=23\u201324}} Those publications supporting the royalist cause were closed down and the publishers prosecuted; Alkin became involved in uncovering those behind the publication. In 1648 the royalist newsbooks the ''Mercurius Melancholicus'' and the ''Parliament Kite'' both referred to her attempts to uncover them, and the following year the ''[[Marchamont Nedham#Mercurius Pragmaticus|Mercurius Pragmaticus]]'' called her an \"old Bitch\" who could \"smell out a Loyall-hearted man as soon as the best Blood-hound in the Army\".{{sfn|Raymond|2007|p=95}}\n\nAlthough Alkin acted as one of the newsbook sellers, between 1650 and 1651 she published several short-lived newsbooks,{{sfn|Raymond|2006|p=306}} including ''The Impartial Scout'', ''The Moderne Intelligencer'', ''Mercurius Anglicus'' (formerly a royalist title which she appropriated) and ''Mercurius Scoticus, or, The Royal Messenger''.{{sfn|Bell|2004}} Clarke believes Alkin may have used formerly royalist titles, or royalist-sounding names to win the confidence of royalist sympathisers, and get them to reveal the location of illicit printers.{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=24}} The historian Marcus Nevitt disagrees, and argues that Alkin was \"reappropriating Royalist titles for Parliamentarian consumption\".{{sfn|Nevitt|2013|p=101}} In total she produced ten notebook issues of differing titles.<ref name=\"Lumbers: review\" />\n\nOne of those she uncovered was [[William Dugard]], who ran four presses at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in London; Dugard was imprisoned in February 1650. The following year she was paid \u00a310 for discovering the printers of Edward Hall's work ''Manus testium lingua testium'', and received further recompense from the Committee for the Advance of Money for other, unknown services.{{sfn|Bell|2004}}\n\n==Post Civil War== \nIn 1653, during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], Alkin assisted [[Daniel Whistler]] in setting up a network of casualty reception stations in [[Portsmouth]], [[Harwich]] and [[East Anglia]]. The stations treated both English and Dutch casualties.<ref name=\"NHS: Military\" />\n\nAlkin made financial claims from the state for her nursing, some of which were paid, although a petition of 1654 refers to her severe illness. The same letter stated that she had had to sell many of her possessions, including her bed.

She received a similar commission from [[Thomas Fairfax|Sir Thomas Fairfax]] two years later.{{sfn|Bell|2004}} Parliamentary records show that in 1645 she received payment from the [[Committee for the Advance of Money]] for uncovering the activities of George Mynnes, a Surrey-based iron merchant, who was supplying metal to the royalist forces.{{sfn|Nevitt|2006|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nIn the seventeenth century, daily news was published in [[newsbook]]s which tended to be small eight-page publications, the forerunners of newspapers.

In 1648 the royalist newsbooks the ''Mercurius Melancholicus'' and the ''Parliament Kite'' both referred to her attempts to uncover them, and the following year the ''[[Marchamont Nedham#Mercurius Pragmaticus|Mercurius Pragmaticus]]'' called her an \"old Bitch\" who could \"smell out a Loyall-hearted man as soon as the best Blood-hound in the Army\".{{sfn|Raymond|2007|p=95}}\n\nAlthough Alkin acted as one of the newsbook sellers, between 1650 and 1651 she published several short-lived newsbooks,{{sfn|Raymond|2006|p=306}} including ''The Impartial Scout'', ''The Moderne Intelligencer'', ''Mercurius Anglicus'' (formerly a royalist title which she appropriated) and ''Mercurius Scoticus, or, The Royal Messenger''.{{sfn|Bell|2004}} Clarke believes Alkin may have used formerly royalist titles, or royalist-sounding names to win the confidence of royalist sympathisers, and get them to reveal the location of illicit printers.{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=24}} The historian Marcus Nevitt disagrees, and argues that Alkin was \"reappropriating Royalist titles for Parliamentarian consumption\".{{sfn|Nevitt|2013|p=101}} In total she produced ten notebook issues of differing titles.<ref name=\"Lumbers: review\" />\n\nOne of those she uncovered was [[William Dugard]], who ran four presses at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in London; Dugard was imprisoned in February 1650. The following year she was paid \u00a310 for discovering the printers of Edward Hall's work ''Manus testium lingua testium'', and received further recompense from the Committee for the Advance of Money for other, unknown services.{{sfn|Bell|2004}}\n\n==Post Civil War== \nIn 1653, during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], Alkin assisted [[Daniel Whistler]] in setting up a network of casualty reception stations in [[Portsmouth]], [[Harwich]] and [[East Anglia]].

With this authority, they began to accumulate lands and power.  During this time the Z\u00e4hringens founded a number of cities including Burgdorf.  Under Duke [[Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen|Berthold V]], in 1200, Burgdorf Castle was expanded.  The old castle consisted of a gatehouse and attached wall.  Berthold V added a tower, [[donjon]] and a hall that connected the two.  The old market and town was north of the castle at the foot of the hill.<ref name=Burgen/>\n\nAfter the extinction of Z\u00e4hringen line, Burgdorf passed to the Counts of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]].  Under the Kyburg or Neu-Kyburg Counts, Burgdorf Castle was the capital of the county, and the Counts were the mayors of Burgdorf town.  Under the Kyburgs, additional fortifications were added to the castle.  The northern [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] was extended and two half-round towers were added.  The eastern end and the western hall were built up and expanded.<ref name=Burgen/>  When the Kyburg line died out in 1264, the castle passed to Eberhard of Habsburg, who was married to Anna of Kyburg.  Eberhard then became the Count of Neu-Kyburg.\n\nIn the 14th century, the Neu-Kyburgs became increasingly indebted.  On 11 November 1382, Count Rudolf II of Neu-Kyburg, launched a raid against the city of [[Solothurn]] to try and force the city to forgive his debts.  For the city of [[Bern]], this attack on an allied city represented an excellent opportunity for the city to break its ties with the Neu-Kyburgs.  In March 1383 the Bernese-Solothurn army marched on Burgdorf.  The army besieged the city for 45 days, but was unsuccessful.  However, on 5 April 1384 the Neu-Kyburg counts were forced to sell the towns and castles of Burgdorf and [[Thun]] to Bern for 37,800 guilders in exchange for peace.<ref name=HDS_Burgdorferkrieg>{{HDS|8733|Burgdorferkrieg}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Burgdorf Schloss Pestalozzitafel.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque remembering Pestalozzi's school at the castle]]\nAfter the [[Burgdorf war]], the castle became the seat of the Bernese administrator.

Then, in 1800, the famous educator, [[Heinrich Pestalozzi]] established a school in the castle.
