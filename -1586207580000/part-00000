Cook]] came up with the album title ''Charli''.]]\nIn 2017, Charli XCX was preparing to release her third studio album. However, a hacker was able to steal several demo tracks from her [[Google Drive]] and [[Internet leak|leaked]] them online. Fans gave the collection of leaks the unofficial title ''XCX World'', though a title and track list was never finalised for the album. After the leaks, Charli XCX decided to scrap the entire project and decided to remake a new album.<ref name=\"XCX World\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/charli-xcx-new-album-interview|title=It's Charli XCX's Party\u2014And Everyone Is Invited|date=13 September 2019|accessdate=16 September 2019|publisher=Glamour|author=Christopher Rosa}}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of monthly single drops in the summer of 2018, Charli XCX released the lead single of the album, \"1999\" in October 2018. Charli XCX and executive producer [[A. G. Cook]] began recording the album in November 2018 at [[Flume (musician)|Flume]]'s studio in [[Los Angeles]], California. The project was initially intended to be the third release in a trilogy of mixtapes, following the release of ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]''. The title was to include the number \"3\", continuing the numbering motif, but the plan was never finalised. After two weeks of recording, Charli XCX decided that the work would instead be her third studio album. Recording continued in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] from January to March 2019, where the majority of the album's songwriting and production took place. The song \"White Mercedes\" was recorded in [[Andrew Watt (musician)|Andrew Watt]]'s home. Initially trying to keep the \"3\" in the title, a working title for the album was ''Best Friends'' before Cook suggested the title ''Charli''.<ref name=\"Fader\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/19/charli-xcx-album-interview-2019-sky-ferreira-christine-queens|title=Charli XCX is making space for the pop music we deserve|website=[[The Fader]]|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=19 September 2019|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Release and promotion==\nOn 13 June 2019, Charli XCX announced ''Charli'', along with its cover art, release date, and track list that featured 15 tracks and 14 collaborations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5479357/charli-xcx-teases-new-album-with-14-collaborations/|title=Charli XCX Teases New Album With 14 Collaborations|website=[[Inquisitr]]|last=Magnocavallo|first=Fabio|date=12 June 2019|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=charli_xcx|number=1139205297707388928|date=13 June 2019|title=angels, my new album 'Charli' is out September 13th. i am so proud of this music and i cannot wait for the world to hear it. pre order 'Charli' now and come and see my on my world tour!! \ud83d\udc93|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref> Charli XCX debuted \"Gone\" with [[Christine and the Queens]] at [[Primavera Sound]] in [[Barcelona]] on 30 May<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/charli-xcx-christine-and-the-queens-collaboration-gone-primavera-live-2503387|title=Watch Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens debut new collaboration 'Gone'|last=Moore|first=Sam|date=31 May 2019|website=NME|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> and \"[[2099 (song)|2099]]\" with [[Troye Sivan]] at the Go West Fest in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/charli-xcx-says-new-album-finished-teases-upcoming-announcement-2506511|title=Charli XCX says her new album is finished and teases its upcoming release date|work=[[NME]]|last=Aubrey|first=Elizabeth|date=9 June 2019|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe album is supported by the [[Charli Live Tour]].

It was released through [[Asylum Records|Asylum]] and [[Atlantic Records UK]] on 13 September 2019. \n\nThe album is supported by a world tour, beginning in [[Atlanta]] on 20 September 2019. ''Charli'' was preceded by the singles \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\" with [[Troye Sivan]], \"[[Blame It on Your Love]]\" featuring [[Lizzo]], and \"[[Gone (Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens song)|Gone]]\" with [[Christine and the Queens]].

However, a hacker was able to steal several demo tracks from her [[Google Drive]] and [[Internet leak|leaked]] them online. Fans gave the collection of leaks the unofficial title ''XCX World'', though a title and track list was never finalised for the album. After the leaks, Charli XCX decided to scrap the entire project and decided to remake a new album.<ref name=\"XCX World\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/charli-xcx-new-album-interview|title=It's Charli XCX's Party\u2014And Everyone Is Invited|date=13 September 2019|accessdate=16 September 2019|publisher=Glamour|author=Christopher Rosa}}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of monthly single drops in the summer of 2018, Charli XCX released the lead single of the album, \"1999\" in October 2018. Charli XCX and executive producer [[A. G. Cook]] began recording the album in November 2018 at [[Flume (musician)|Flume]]'s studio in [[Los Angeles]], California. The project was initially intended to be the third release in a trilogy of mixtapes, following the release of ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]''. The title was to include the number \"3\", continuing the numbering motif, but the plan was never finalised. After two weeks of recording, Charli XCX decided that the work would instead be her third studio album. Recording continued in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] from January to March 2019, where the majority of the album's songwriting and production took place. The song \"White Mercedes\" was recorded in [[Andrew Watt (musician)|Andrew Watt]]'s home. Initially trying to keep the \"3\" in the title, a working title for the album was ''Best Friends'' before Cook suggested the title ''Charli''.<ref name=\"Fader\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/19/charli-xcx-album-interview-2019-sky-ferreira-christine-queens|title=Charli XCX is making space for the pop music we deserve|website=[[The Fader]]|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=19 September 2019|accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Release and promotion==\nOn 13 June 2019, Charli XCX announced ''Charli'', along with its cover art, release date, and track list that featured 15 tracks and 14 collaborations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5479357/charli-xcx-teases-new-album-with-14-collaborations/|title=Charli XCX Teases New Album With 14 Collaborations|website=[[Inquisitr]]|last=Magnocavallo|first=Fabio|date=12 June 2019|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=charli_xcx|number=1139205297707388928|date=13 June 2019|title=angels, my new album 'Charli' is out September 13th. i am so proud of this music and i cannot wait for the world to hear it. pre order 'Charli' now and come and see my on my world tour!! \ud83d\udc93|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref> Charli XCX debuted \"Gone\" with [[Christine and the Queens]] at [[Primavera Sound]] in [[Barcelona]] on 30 May<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/charli-xcx-christine-and-the-queens-collaboration-gone-primavera-live-2503387|title=Watch Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens debut new collaboration 'Gone'|last=Moore|first=Sam|date=31 May 2019|website=NME|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> and \"[[2099 (song)|2099]]\" with [[Troye Sivan]] at the Go West Fest in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/charli-xcx-says-new-album-finished-teases-upcoming-announcement-2506511|title=Charli XCX says her new album is finished and teases its upcoming release date|work=[[NME]]|last=Aubrey|first=Elizabeth|date=9 June 2019|accessdate=14 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe album is supported by the [[Charli Live Tour]].
