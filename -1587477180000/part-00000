It was developed to be a conversion of the M113, of which the Egyptian Army has a total of 2,650, as well as an additional 1,200 [[AIFV]]s (modified M113s), but it can also be produced as new vehicles. Design activities first commenced in 1995, and the first prototype was assembled in the Egyptian Military Plant 200 where assembly of the [[M1 Abrams]] is carried out for the Egyptian Army. The first prototype was completed by Egyptian Military Plant 200 in 1996 and performance validation trials were completed in mid-1997. The EIFV has not entered production.<ref name=\"janesAPC\"/><ref name=\"BAE\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe EIFV has three crewman, and can carry six soldiers, who enter the vehicle via a rear drop ramp. The driver is seated at the left front of the hull with the engine compartment to his right. The driver has a single-piece pop-up hatch cover which rotates over the engine cooling air intake grill when open, and is provided with four, day periscopes for observation.<ref name=\"janesAPC\"/> The commander and the gunner are both positioned in the turret itself, and a hatch is provided for the commander on the turret roof.\n\n===Armor===\nThe M113 chassis is enlarged to accommodate several modifications and to allow for more armor to be added. The hull of the EIFV is of all-welded 5083 aluminum armour which provides protection from small arms fire and shell splinters, able to defeat armour-piercing projectiles up to 14.5&nbsp;mm in calibre over a 360\u00b0 arc of attack.<ref name=\"janesAPC\"/> Aluminum provides protection similar to that of steel armor while keeping the vehicle lightweight. An armor upgrade package produced by the [[Arab Organization for Industrialization|AOI]] can significantly enhance the armor on the EIFV even further, allowing it to withstand armor-piercing 23&nbsp;mm rounds, without sacrificing the vehicle's mobility. Optional upgrades for the vehicle include air conditioning, NBC protection and firing ports.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aoi.com.eg/aoi_eng/milit_new/vehicle/m113.htm |title=Arab Organization for Industrialization |access-date=2009-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624115704/http://www.aoi.com.eg/aoi_eng/milit_new/vehicle/m113.htm |archive-date=2007-06-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Maneuverability===\nTo cope with the increased size and armor of the vehicle, a more powerful 400&nbsp;hp Detroit Diesel 6V53TIA turbocharged/aftercooled diesel engine is installed in place of the original 275&nbsp;hp engine on the M113, giving a power-to-weight ratio of 20&nbsp;hp/ton. This is coupled to an Allison X200 cross-drive, four-speed [[Torque converter|Hydrokinetic transmission]]. As a result of the longer chassis and improved engine a sixth road wheel is added (the M113 only has five). As an option the vehicle can be of 350&nbsp;hp only. The modifications allows the EIFV to keep up in terms of speed and mobility with modern tanks such as the [[M1 Abrams|M1A1/A2 Abrams]], which are used by the Egyptian Army, despite the added weight. The vehicle can traverse [[Grade (slope)|slopes]] up to 80%, side slopes of 40%, trenches 2200&nbsp;mm wide, and vertical obstacles with a height of 710&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"BAEspecs\"/>\n\n===Armament===\nThe [[M2 Bradley]] turret provides the EIFV with considerable firepower on a cheap M113 chassis, and allows it to engage personnel, armored vehicles and tanks, as well as low flying targets and helicopters. It has the same fire control and stabilization features on the M2 Bradley. The armament consists of the 25&nbsp;mm [[M242 Bushmaster|M242]] [[chain gun]] with 800 rounds and an effective range of 3000 m, and a coaxial [[7.62 mm caliber|7.62 mm]] machine gun with 2,100 rounds. Using armor-piercing rounds, the chain gun can engage armored vehicles and tanks. The turret also has a two-tube TOW launcher, capable of launching [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW II]] [[ATGM]] missiles, which can destroy most tanks at a maximum range of 3750 m, enabling the vehicle to be used in an [[Anti-tank warfare|anti tank role]]. The only major drawback is that the missiles can only be launched when the vehicle is stationary. In addition to the two missiles in the launcher are four more missiles, stowed away inside the vehicle. The turret is standard equipped with [[Infrared homing|passive IR]] and [[thermal imaging]] equipment.<ref name=\"janesAPC\"/><ref name=\"BAEspecs\"/><ref name=\"BAE\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 APC]]\n*[[AIFV]]\n*[[Armoured warfare]]\n*[[Infantry Fighting Vehicle]]\n\n[[Category:Armoured fighting vehicles of Egypt]]\n[[Category:Tracked infantry fighting vehicles|*]]\n[[Category:Armoured fighting vehicles of the post\u2013Cold War period]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|name=Egyptian Infantry Fighting Vehicle (EIFV)\n| image=\n|caption=\n|origin= [[Egypt]]\n|type= [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]\n|is_vehicle= yes\n|service= trials in 1997\n|used_by= [[Egyptian Army]]\n|wars=\n|designer= [[BAE Systems]]\n|design_date=\n|manufacturer= Egyptian Tank Factory, [[Arab Organization for Industrialization]]\n|unit_cost= $311,000\n|production_date= 1996\n|number= 1\n|variants=\n|length= 5.26 m\n|width= 2.82 m\n|height= 2.5 m\n|weight= 17.7 tons\n|suspension= torsion bar\n|speed= 66 km/h\n|vehicle_range= 482 km\n|primary_armament= 25 mm [[M242]] Chain Gun <br/> [[BGM-71 TOW|BGM-71 TOW II]]\n|secondary_armament= 7.62 mm [[FN MAG]]\n|armour= [[Aluminum]]\n|engine= Detroit Diesel 6V53TIA electronically controlled\n|crew= 3+7\n|engine_power= 400 hp at 2800 rpm\n|transmission= [[Torque converter|Hydrokinetic]]\n|fuel_capacity= 454 liters\n|clearance=\n|pw_ratio= 20.0 hp/ton\n}}\n\nThe '''Egyptian Infantry Fighting Vehicle (EIFV)''', also known as '''Infantry Fighting Vehicle Light (IFVL)''', is an Egyptian modification of the [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier]].

It was fought on 3\u20134 October 1993, in [[Madagascar]], [[Somalia]], between forces of the United States\u2014supported by [[UNOSOM II]]\u2014and Somali militiamen loyal to the self-proclaimed president-to-be [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]].\n\nThe initial [[Joint Special Operations Command]] force, Task Force Ranger, was a collaboration of various elite special forces units from the [[United States Army Special Operations Command]], the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]], and the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command]]. It consisted mostly of members from the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and [[Delta Force]].\n\nTask Force Ranger was dispatched to seize two of Aidid's high-echelon lieutenants during a meeting in the city.  The goal of the operation was achieved, although conditions spiraled into the deadly Battle of Madagascar. The initial operation of 3 October 1993, intended to last an hour, became an overnight standoff and rescue operation extending into the daylight hours of 4 October 1993.\n\n==Summary==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nTask Force Ranger was created in August 1993, and deployed to [[Somalia]]. It consisted of various elite [[special operations]] units from Army, Air Force and Navy special services: [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Rangers]] from Bravo Company, [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]] [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]]; C Squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), better known as \"[[Delta Force]]\"; helicopters flown by 1st Battalion, [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]; [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Air Force Combat Controllers]]; [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force Pararescuemen]]; and [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|Navy SEALs]]. As a multi-disciplinary joint special forces operation, Task Force Ranger reported to [[Joint Special Operations Command]], led by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Garrison]].{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn 3 October 1993, Task Force Ranger began an operation that involved traveling from their compound on the city's outskirts to the center with the aim of capturing the leaders of the [[Habar Gidir|Habar Gidir clan]], led by [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]. The assault force consisted of nineteen aircraft, twelve vehicles (including nine [[Humvee]]s), and 160 men. The operation was intended to last no longer than one hour.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nShortly after the assault began, Somali militia and armed civilian fighters shot down two MH-60L Black Hawk helicopters. The subsequent operation to secure and recover the crews of both helicopters extended the initial operation into an overnight standoff and daylight rescue operation on 4 October. The battle resulted in 18 deaths, 73 wounded and one helicopter pilot captured among the U.S. raid party and rescue forces. At least one Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed as part of the rescue forces on day two of the battle. American sources estimate between 1,500 and 3,000 Somali casualties, including civilians; the [[Somali National Alliance]] (SNA) claims 315 dead, with 812 wounded.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Madagascar residential area.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine Corps helicopter surveying a residential area in [[Madagascar]] as part of [[Operation Restore Hope]] (1992).]]\nDuring the operation, two U.S. [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters were shot down by [[RPG-7|RPG]]s and three others were damaged. Some of the wounded survivors were able to evacuate to the compound, but others remained near the crash sites and were isolated. An urban battle ensued and continued throughout the night.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nEarly the next morning, a combined task force was sent to rescue the trapped soldiers. It contained soldiers from the [[Pakistan Army]], the [[Malaysian Army]] and the U.S. Army's [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]]. They assembled over one hundred vehicles, including Pakistani tanks ([[M48 Patton|M48s]]) and Malaysian [[Condor (APC)|Condor]] armored personnel carriers and were supported by U.S. [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|MH-6 Little Bird]] and MH-60L Black Hawk helicopters. This task force reached the first crash site and rescued the survivors.  The second crash site had been overrun by hostile Somalis during the night. Delta snipers [[Gary Gordon]] and [[Randy Shughart]] had volunteered to hold them off until ground forces arrived. A Somali mob with thousands of combatants had eventually overrun the two men. That site's lone surviving American, pilot [[Michael Durant]], had been taken prisoner but was later released.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:An abandoned MOGADISHU Street known as the Green Line, Jan 1993.JPEG|thumb|Abandoned \"Green Line\" dividing the warring factions in North and South Mogadishu (January 1993).]]\nThe exact number of Somali casualties is unknown, but estimates range from several hundred to a thousand militiamen and others killed,<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/synopsis.html Ambush In Mogadishu \u2013 PBS Frontline].

These wars led to the destruction of [[economy of Somalia|Somalia's agriculture]], which in turn led to starvation in large parts of the country. The [[international community]] began to send food supplies to halt the starvation, but vast amounts of food were hijacked and brought to local clan leaders, who routinely exchanged it with other countries for weapons.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} An estimated 80 percent of the food was stolen. These factors led to even more [[starvation]], from which an estimated 300,000 people died and another 1.5 million people suffered between 1991 and 1992. In July 1992, after a ceasefire between the opposing clan factions, the U.N. sent 50 military observers to watch the food's distribution.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\n[[File:GWB choc chip camo.JPG|thumb|US president [[George H.

W. Bush]] announced that U.S. military transports would support the multinational U.N. relief effort in Somalia. Ten [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130s]] and 400 people were deployed to [[Mombasa]], Kenya, airlifting aid to Somalia's remote areas and reducing reliance on truck convoys. The C-130s delivered 48,000 tons of food and medical supplies in six months to international humanitarian organizations trying to help Somalia's more than three million starving people.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\nWhen this proved inadequate to stop the massive death and displacement of the Somali people (500,000 dead and 1.5 million refugees or displaced), the U.S. launched a major coalition operation to assist and protect humanitarian activities in December 1992. This operation, called [[Operation Restore Hope]], saw the U.S. assuming the unified command in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794|Resolution 794]]. The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] landed the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit MEUSOC]] in Mogadishu with elements of [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]] and [[3rd Battalion 11th Marines]], secured nearly one-third of the city, the port, and airport facilities within two weeks, with the intent to facilitate airlifted humanitarian supplies. Elements of the [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]] HMLA-369 (Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369 of Marine Aircraft Group 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, Camp Pendleton); [[2nd Battalion 9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marines]]; quickly secured routes to [[Baidoa]], Balidogle and [[Kismayo]], then were reinforced by the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\n===Mission shift===\n[[File:Saudi Arabian Humvee.jpg|thumb|[[UNOSOM II]] [[humvee]] departing for the seaport of [[Mogadishu]].]]\nOn 3 March 1993, the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|U.N.

Security Council]] his recommendations for effecting the transition from [[Unified Task Force|UNITAF]] to [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UNOSOM II]]. He indicated that since Resolution 794's adoption in December 1992, UNITAF's presence and operations had created a positive impact on Somalia's security situation and on the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance (UNITAF deployed 37,000 personnel over forty percent of southern and central Somalia). There was still no effective government, police, or national army with the result of serious security threats to U.N. personnel. To that end, the Security Council authorized UNOSOM II to establish a secure environment throughout Somalia, to achieve national reconciliation so as to create a democratic state.<ref name=Clancy/><ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosom2p.htm UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA II].

Within a month or so, however, by May 1993, it became clear that, although a signatory to the March Agreement, [[Mohammed Farrah Aidid]]'s faction would not cooperate in the Agreement's implementation.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\nAidid began to broadcast anti-U.N. propaganda on Radio Mogadishu after believing that the U.N. was purposefully marginalizing him in an attempt to \"rebuild Somalia\". Lieutenant General [[\u00c7evik Bir]] ordered the radio station shut down, in an attempt to quash the beginning of what could turn into a rebellion. Civilian spies throughout UNOSOM II's headquarters likely led to the uncovering of the U.N.'s plan. On 5 June 1993, Aidid ordered SNA militia to attack a Pakistani force that had been tasked with the inspection of an arms cache located at the radio station, possibly out of fear that this was a task force sent to shut down the broadcast. The result was 24 dead and 57 wounded Pakistani troops, as well as 1 wounded Italian and 3 wounded American soldiers.\nOn 6 June 1993, the U.N. Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 837|Resolution 837]], for the arrest and prosecution of the persons responsible for the death and wounding of the peacekeepers.<ref>Security Council, Resolution 837, United Nations Doc.

In all, between 2,000\u20134,000 regular faction members are believed to have participated, almost all of whom belonged to Aidid's [[Somali National Alliance]].

It began as the United Somali Congress (USC) under Aidid's leadership. At the time of Operation Gothic Serpent, the SNA was composed of Col.

Somali citizens and local militia formed barricades along Mogadishu's streets with rocks, wreckage, rubbish and burning tires, blocking the convoy from reaching the Rangers and their captives.

Next, the two Black Hawks carrying the second Delta assault team led by DELTA officer Captain [[Austin S. Miller]] came into position and dropped their teams as the four Ranger chalks prepared to rope onto the four corners surrounding the target building. Chalk Four being carried by Black Hawk ''Super 67'', piloted by [[Warrant officer (United States)#Ranks|CW3]] Jeff Niklaus, was accidentally put a block north of their intended point.

Jones left the helicopter and carried Busch to the safety of the helicopter, while Maier provided cover fire from the cockpit repeatedly denying orders to lift off while his co-pilot was not in the Bird. Maier nearly hit Chalk One's Lieutenant DiTomasso, arriving with Rangers and Delta operators to secure the site. Jones and Maier evacuated Busch and Smith.

Despite the damage, ''Super 68'' did make it back to base. The CSAR team found both the pilots dead and two wounded inside the crashed helicopter.

Shughart went back around the helicopter's nose and held off the mob for about 10 more minutes before he was killed. The Somalis then overran the crash site and killed all but Durant. He was nearly beaten to death, but was saved when members of Aidid's militia came to take him prisoner.<ref name=e3436/> For their actions, MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart were [[Wiktionary:posthumously|posthumously]] awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the first awarded since the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=willbanks/>\n\nRepeated attempts by the Somalis to mass forces and overrun the American positions in a series of firefights near the first crash site were neutralized by aggressive small arms fire and by strafing runs and rocket attacks from [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|AH-6J Little Bird]] helicopter gunships of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Nightstalkers]], the only air unit equipped and trained for night fighting.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Relief convoy arrives ===\n[[File:Mogadishu technical.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Improvised fighting vehicle]] in Mogadishu.]]\nA relief convoy with elements from the [[Task Force]] [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2\u201314 Infantry]], [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], accompanied by Malaysian and Pakistani U.N. forces, arrived at the first crash site at around 02:00. No contingency planning or coordination with U.N. forces had been arranged prior to the operation; consequently, the recovery of the surrounded American troops was significantly complicated and delayed. Determined to protect all of the rescue convoy's members, General Garrison made sure that the convoy would roll out in force.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nWhen the convoy finally pushed into the city, it consisted of more than 100 U.N. vehicles including Malaysian forces' German-made [[Condor (APC)|Condor APC]]s, four Pakistani tanks ([[M48 Patton|M48s]]), American [[HMMWV]]s and several M939 five-ton flatbed trucks. This two-mile-long column was supported by several other Black Hawks and Cobra assault helicopters stationed with the 10th Mountain Division. Meanwhile, Task Force Ranger's \"Little Birds\" continued their defense of ''Super 61''{{'s}} downed crew and rescuers.

Clinton defended his exit strategy for U.S. forces and denied that the departure was premature. He said conservative Republicans had pushed him to leave the region before the operation's objectives could be achieved: \"...[Conservative Republicans] were all trying to get me to withdraw from Somalia in 1993 the next day after we were involved in 'Black Hawk down,' and I refused to do it and stayed six months and had an orderly transfer to the United Nations.\"<ref name=\"foxnews.com\">{{cite web|title=Transcript: William Jefferson Clinton|publisher=Foxnews.com|date=26 September 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215397,00.html|accessdate=25 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318184340/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215397,00.html|archive-date=18 March 2013|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nClinton's remarks would suggest the U.S. was not deterred from pursuing their humanitarian goals because of the loss of U.S. forces during the battle. In the same interview, he stated that, at the time, there was \"not a living soul in the world who thought that Osama bin Laden had anything to do with Black Hawk down or was paying any attention to it or even knew al-Qaeda was a growing concern in October of '93\", and that the mission was strictly humanitarian.<ref name=\"foxnews.com\"/>\n\nFear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped U.S. policy in subsequent years, with many commentators identifying the Battle of Mogadishu's graphic consequences as the key reason behind the U.S.'s failure to intervene in later conflicts such as the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994.

The al-Qaeda fighters in Somalia are rumored to have included the organization's military chief, [[Mohammed Atef]], later killed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

It was fought on 3\u20134 October 1993, in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]], between forces of the United States\u2014supported by [[UNOSOM II]]\u2014and Somali militiamen loyal to the self-proclaimed president-to-be [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]].\n\nThe initial [[Joint Special Operations Command]] force, Task Force Ranger, was a collaboration of various elite special forces units from the [[United States Army Special Operations Command]], the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]], and the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command]]. It consisted mostly of members from the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and [[Delta Force]].\n\nTask Force Ranger was dispatched to seize two of Aidid's high-echelon lieutenants during a meeting in the city.  The goal of the operation was achieved, although conditions spiraled into the deadly Battle of Mogadishu. The initial operation of 3 October 1993, intended to last an hour, became an overnight standoff and rescue operation extending into the daylight hours of 4 October 1993.\n\n==Summary==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nTask Force Ranger was created in August 1993, and deployed to [[Somalia]]. It consisted of various elite [[special operations]] units from Army, Air Force and Navy special services: [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Rangers]] from Bravo Company, [[3rd Ranger Battalion (United States)|3rd Battalion]] [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]]; C Squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), better known as \"[[Delta Force]]\"; helicopters flown by 1st Battalion, [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]; [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Air Force Combat Controllers]]; [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force Pararescuemen]]; and [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|Navy SEALs]]. As a multi-disciplinary joint special forces operation, Task Force Ranger reported to [[Joint Special Operations Command]], led by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Garrison]].{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn 3 October 1993, Task Force Ranger began an operation that involved traveling from their compound on the city's outskirts to the center with the aim of capturing the leaders of the [[Habar Gidir|Habar Gidir clan]], led by [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]. The assault force consisted of nineteen aircraft, twelve vehicles (including nine [[Humvee]]s), and 160 men. The operation was intended to last no longer than one hour.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nShortly after the assault began, Somali militia and armed civilian fighters shot down two MH-60L Black Hawk helicopters. The subsequent operation to secure and recover the crews of both helicopters extended the initial operation into an overnight standoff and daylight rescue operation on 4 October. The battle resulted in 18 deaths, 73 wounded and one helicopter pilot captured among the U.S. raid party and rescue forces. At least one Pakistani soldier and one Malaysian soldier were killed as part of the rescue forces on day two of the battle. American sources estimate between 1,500 and 3,000 Somali casualties, including civilians; the [[Somali National Alliance]] (SNA) claims 315 dead, with 812 wounded.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Marine Corps helicopter surveying a residential area in [[Mogadishu]] as part of [[Operation Restore Hope]] (1992).]]\nDuring the operation, two U.S. [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters were shot down by [[RPG-7|RPG]]s and three others were damaged. Some of the wounded survivors were able to evacuate to the compound, but others remained near the crash sites and were isolated. An urban battle ensued and continued throughout the night.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nEarly the next morning, a combined task force was sent to rescue the trapped soldiers. It contained soldiers from the [[Pakistan Army]], the [[Malaysian Army]] and the U.S. Army's [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]]. They assembled over one hundred vehicles, including Pakistani tanks ([[M48 Patton|M48s]]) and Malaysian [[Condor (APC)|Condor]] armored personnel carriers and were supported by U.S. [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|MH-6 Little Bird]] and MH-60L Black Hawk helicopters. This task force reached the first crash site and rescued the survivors.  The second crash site had been overrun by hostile Somalis during the night. Delta snipers [[Gary Gordon]] and [[Randy Shughart]] had volunteered to hold them off until ground forces arrived. A Somali mob with thousands of combatants had eventually overrun the two men. That site's lone surviving American, pilot [[Michael Durant]], had been taken prisoner but was later released.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:An abandoned MOGADISHU Street known as the Green Line, Jan 1993.JPEG|thumb|Abandoned \"Green Line\" dividing the warring factions in North and South Mogadishu (January 1993).]]\nThe exact number of Somali casualties is unknown, but estimates range from several hundred to a thousand militiamen and others killed,<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/synopsis.html Ambush In Mogadishu \u2013 PBS Frontline].

These wars led to the destruction of [[economy of Somalia|Somalia's agriculture]], which in turn led to starvation in large parts of the country. The [[international community]] began to send food supplies to halt the starvation, but vast amounts of food were hijacked and brought to local clan leaders, who routinely exchanged it with other countries for weapons.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} An estimated 80 percent of the food was stolen. These factors led to even more [[starvation]], from which an estimated 300,000 people died and another 1.5 million people suffered between 1991 and 1992. In July 1992, after a ceasefire between the opposing clan factions, the U.N. sent 50 military observers to watch the food's distribution.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\n[[File:GWB choc chip camo.JPG|thumb|US president [[George H.

W. Bush]] announced that U.S. military transports would support the multinational U.N. relief effort in Somalia. Ten [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130s]] and 400 people were deployed to [[Mombasa]], Kenya, airlifting aid to Somalia's remote areas and reducing reliance on truck convoys. The C-130s delivered 48,000 tons of food and medical supplies in six months to international humanitarian organizations trying to help Somalia's more than three million starving people.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\nWhen this proved inadequate to stop the massive death and displacement of the Somali people (500,000 dead and 1.5 million refugees or displaced), the U.S. launched a major coalition operation to assist and protect humanitarian activities in December 1992. This operation, called [[Operation Restore Hope]], saw the U.S. assuming the unified command in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794|Resolution 794]]. The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] landed the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit MEUSOC]] in Mogadishu with elements of [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]] and [[3rd Battalion 11th Marines]], secured nearly one-third of the city, the port, and airport facilities within two weeks, with the intent to facilitate airlifted humanitarian supplies. Elements of the [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]] HMLA-369 (Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 369 of Marine Aircraft Group 39, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, Camp Pendleton); [[2nd Battalion 9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marines]]; quickly secured routes to [[Baidoa]], Balidogle and [[Kismayo]], then were reinforced by the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\n===Mission shift===\n[[File:Saudi Arabian Humvee.jpg|thumb|[[UNOSOM II]] [[humvee]] departing for the seaport of [[Mogadishu]].]]\nOn 3 March 1993, the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|U.N.

Security Council]] his recommendations for effecting the transition from [[Unified Task Force|UNITAF]] to [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UNOSOM II]]. He indicated that since Resolution 794's adoption in December 1992, UNITAF's presence and operations had created a positive impact on Somalia's security situation and on the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance (UNITAF deployed 37,000 personnel over forty percent of southern and central Somalia). There was still no effective government, police, or national army with the result of serious security threats to U.N. personnel. To that end, the Security Council authorized UNOSOM II to establish a secure environment throughout Somalia, to achieve national reconciliation so as to create a democratic state.<ref name=Clancy/><ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosom2p.htm UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA II].

Within a month or so, however, by May 1993, it became clear that, although a signatory to the March Agreement, [[Mohammed Farrah Aidid]]'s faction would not cooperate in the Agreement's implementation.<ref name=Clancy/>\n\nAidid began to broadcast anti-U.N. propaganda on Radio Mogadishu after believing that the U.N. was purposefully marginalizing him in an attempt to \"rebuild Somalia\". Lieutenant General [[\u00c7evik Bir]] ordered the radio station shut down, in an attempt to quash the beginning of what could turn into a rebellion. Civilian spies throughout UNOSOM II's headquarters likely led to the uncovering of the U.N.'s plan. On 5 June 1993, Aidid ordered SNA militia to attack a Pakistani force that had been tasked with the inspection of an arms cache located at the radio station, possibly out of fear that this was a task force sent to shut down the broadcast. The result was 24 dead and 57 wounded Pakistani troops, as well as 1 wounded Italian and 3 wounded American soldiers.\nOn 6 June 1993, the U.N. Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 837|Resolution 837]], for the arrest and prosecution of the persons responsible for the death and wounding of the peacekeepers.<ref>Security Council, Resolution 837, United Nations Doc.

In all, between 2,000\u20134,000 regular faction members are believed to have participated, almost all of whom belonged to Aidid's [[Somali National Alliance]].

It began as the United Somali Congress (USC) under Aidid's leadership. At the time of Operation Gothic Serpent, the SNA was composed of Col.

Next, the two Black Hawks carrying the second Delta assault team led by DELTA officer Captain [[Austin S. Miller]] came into position and dropped their teams as the four Ranger chalks prepared to rope onto the four corners surrounding the target building. Chalk Four being carried by Black Hawk ''Super 67'', piloted by [[Warrant officer (United States)#Ranks|CW3]] Jeff Niklaus, was accidentally put a block north of their intended point.

Shughart went back around the helicopter's nose and held off the mob for about 10 more minutes before he was killed. The Somalis then overran the crash site and killed all but Durant. He was nearly beaten to death, but was saved when members of Aidid's militia came to take him prisoner.<ref name=e3436/> For their actions, MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart were [[Wiktionary:posthumously|posthumously]] awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the first awarded since the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=willbanks/>\n\nRepeated attempts by the Somalis to mass forces and overrun the American positions in a series of firefights near the first crash site were neutralized by aggressive small arms fire and by strafing runs and rocket attacks from [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|AH-6J Little Bird]] helicopter gunships of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Nightstalkers]], the only air unit equipped and trained for night fighting.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Relief convoy arrives ===\n[[File:Mogadishu technical.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Improvised fighting vehicle]] in Mogadishu.]]\nA relief convoy with elements from the [[Task Force]] [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|2\u201314 Infantry]], [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], accompanied by Malaysian and Pakistani U.N. forces, arrived at the first crash site at around 02:00. No contingency planning or coordination with U.N. forces had been arranged prior to the operation; consequently, the recovery of the surrounded American troops was significantly complicated and delayed. Determined to protect all of the rescue convoy's members, General Garrison made sure that the convoy would roll out in force.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nWhen the convoy finally pushed into the city, it consisted of more than 100 U.N. vehicles including Malaysian forces' German-made [[Condor (APC)|Condor APC]]s, four Pakistani tanks ([[M48 Patton|M48s]]), American [[HMMWV]]s and several M939 five-ton flatbed trucks. This two-mile-long column was supported by several other Black Hawks and Cobra assault helicopters stationed with the 10th Mountain Division. Meanwhile, Task Force Ranger's \"Little Birds\" continued their defense of ''Super 61''{{'s}} downed crew and rescuers.

And the Americans and those who came to their rescue, were being shot at from all sides ... a deliberate war battle, if you will, on the part of the Somalis. And women and children were being used as shields and some cases women and children were actually firing weapons, and were coming from all sides. Sort of a rabbit warren of huts, houses, alleys, and twisting and turning streets, so those who were trying to defend themselves were shooting back in all directions. Helicopter gun ships were being used as well as all sorts of automatic weapons on the ground by the U.S. and the United Nations.

He said conservative Republicans had pushed him to leave the region before the operation's objectives could be achieved: \"...[Conservative Republicans] were all trying to get me to withdraw from Somalia in 1993 the next day after we were involved in 'Black Hawk down,' and I refused to do it and stayed six months and had an orderly transfer to the United Nations.\"<ref name=\"foxnews.com\">{{cite web|title=Transcript: William Jefferson Clinton|publisher=Foxnews.com|date=26 September 2006|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215397,00.html|accessdate=25 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318184340/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215397,00.html|archive-date=18 March 2013|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nClinton's remarks would suggest the U.S. was not deterred from pursuing their humanitarian goals because of the loss of U.S. forces during the battle.

The film was also remade in Kannada as ''Poorna Chandra'' with [[Ambareesh]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story begins with a family man, (Thengai Srinivasan), who has a wife and 4 children.  He values the present moment and wants to lead a luxurious life along with his family.  He spends a lot of his earnings rather than saving. Suddenly, one day, when his eldest son is just 6 years old, he dies in a road accident after getting heavily drunk. The eldest boy, Santhanam (Rajnikanth), visits his father's boss and asks for a job.  He gets a job at the printing press and learns a trade running the printing press. He also does many other odd jobs.  He aspires to give his siblings the comfort that his father wanted for his family.\n\nAll four children grow up and their mother dies suddenly.  While Santhanam continues working in the print press, his siblings go to college.  He seeks the help of his friend (Cho Ramasamy) and his boss, asking them for money as and when he requires for his siblings' studies.  Santhanam and a co-worker fall in love, but she breaks off when she comes to know of his numerous debts and continuing responsibilities towards his siblings.  Santhanam's sister falls in love with a rich man and Santhanam feels he needs to give a suitable dowry to get his sister married to the rich man.  His younger brother advises him not to give a dowry as the groom did not ask for it and also because they cannot afford a dowry.  Santhanam goes ahead with the dowry and finds he is short of money, despite help from his friend and boss.  In desperation, he marries Lakshmi (Phataphat Jayalakshmi) when he is promised a sum of money.  But it turns out to be a false promise.  He then goes to a loan shark to obtain money. Later his sister ill treats him during his visit to their home mocking at his cheap gift to her new born baby.\n\nSanthanam's younger brother (L. I. C. Narasimhan) graduates and gets a good job.  Santhanam believes that his brother will help improving their family condition. But he doesn't help out Santhanam financially and becomes selfish purchasing expensive dresses and a watch only for him.  He says that Santhanam's money problems were brought onto himself. Santhanam and his brother get into quarrel and his brother leaves the home and marries his friend. Santhanam's situation gets worse with his friend Cho losing his job and his boss falling ill.  The printing press is now managed by the son of his ex-boss who does not like Santhanam as he has borrowed so much money from his father. Santhanam's new boss ask him to repay the money he owed to his father or else resign his job. Santhanam loses his job and he half-heartedly attempts to get help from his well-off siblings and fails.  Unable to pay rent, he, his wife and child move to a slum.  Santhanam gets a job as a proof reader, his wife earns some money doing some sewing and they have another child.  Santhanam develops an interest to write and completes his first novel.  His friend Cho, who has also recovered, publishes it.  On the day that the book is available, Santhanam's wife leaves her kids at home to go to the market.  In her absence, a fire occurs in the slum area.  She rushes back to save her children and is badly burnt in the fire.  She dies and Santhanam gets a sum of money from an insurance policy that she had secretly taken up.  His friend suggests that they produce their own newspaper and this goes well.  Santhanam becomes a popular novelist, winning a writer's award and he becomes rich. His siblings also unite with him considering that he is a celebrity now other than being very rich.\n\nHe is now 60 years old and he doesn't reject them, he knows though, that it was his wife who was there for him through the hard times. Santhanam's both children leave to abroad for their higher education thanks to Cho who managed his finances and the press they started with Santhanam bringing in the creative input. The movie ends with Santhanam dying in a chair looking at his wife's photo and thinking about the opportunistic behaviour of his siblings and the meaninglessness of life.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Rajinikanth]] as Santhanam\n*[[Fatafat Jayalaxmi]] as Lakshmi\n*[[Cho Ramaswamy|Cho]] as Alagappan\n*Sangeetha as Amutha\n*[[Thengai Srinivasan]] as Santhanam's father\n*[[Jaya Guhanathan|Jaya]] as Santhanam's sister\n*[[T.

The film was also remade in Kannada as ''Poorna Chandra'' with [[Ambareesh]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story begins with a family man, (Thengai Srinivasan), who has a wife and 4 children.  He values the present moment and wants to lead a luxurious life along with his family.  He spends a lot of his earnings rather than saving. Suddenly, one day, when his eldest son is just 6 years old, he dies in a road accident after getting heavily drunk. The eldest boy, Santhanam (Rajnikanth), visits his father's boss and asks for a job.  He gets a job at the printing press and learns a trade running the printing press. He also does many other odd jobs.  He aspires to give his siblings the comfort that his father wanted for his family.\n\nAll four children grow up and their mother dies suddenly.  While Santhanam continues working in the print press, his siblings go to college.  He seeks the help of his friend (Cho Ramasamy) and his boss, asking them for money as and when he requires for his siblings' studies.  Santhanam and a co-worker fall in love, but she breaks off when she comes to know of his numerous debts and continuing responsibilities towards his siblings.  Santhanam's sister falls in love with a rich man and Santhanam feels he needs to give a suitable dowry to get his sister married to the rich man.  His younger brother advises him not to give a dowry as the groom did not ask for it and also because they cannot afford a dowry.  Santhanam goes ahead with the dowry and finds he is short of money, despite help from his friend and boss.  In desperation, he marries Lakshmi (Phataphat Jayalakshmi) when he is promised a sum of money.  But it turns out to be a false promise.  He then goes to a loan shark to obtain money. Later his sister ill treats him during his visit to their home mocking at his cheap gift to her new born baby.\n\nSanthanam's younger brother (L. I. C. Narasimhan) graduates and gets a good job.  Santhanam believes that his brother will help improving their family condition. But he doesn't help out Santhanam financially and becomes selfish purchasing expensive dresses and a watch only for him.  He says that Santhanam's money problems were brought onto himself. Santhanam and his brother get into quarrel and his brother leaves the home and gets married to his friend. Santhanam's situation gets worse with his friend Cho losing his job and his boss falling ill.  The printing press is now managed by the son of his ex-boss who does not like Santhanam as he has borrowed so much money from his father. Santhanam's new boss ask him to repay the money he owed to his father or else resign his job. Santhanam loses his job and he half-heartedly attempts to get help from his well-off siblings and fails.  Unable to pay rent, he, his wife and child move to a slum.  Santhanam gets a job as a proof reader, his wife earns some money doing some sewing and they have another child.  Santhanam develops an interest to write and completes his first novel.  His friend Cho, who has also recovered, publishes it.  On the day that the book is available, Santhanam's wife leaves her kids at home to go to the market.  In her absence, a fire occurs in the slum area.  She rushes back to save her children and is badly burnt in the fire.  She dies and Santhanam gets a sum of money from an insurance policy that she had secretly taken up.  His friend suggests that they produce their own newspaper and this goes well.  Santhanam becomes a popular novelist, winning a writer's award and he becomes rich. His siblings also unite with him considering that he is a celebrity now other than being very rich.\n\nHe is now 60 years old and he doesn't reject them, he knows though, that it was his wife who was there for him through the hard times. Santhanam's both children leave to abroad for their higher education thanks to Cho who managed his finances and the press they started with Santhanam bringing in the creative input. The movie ends with Santhanam dying in a chair looking at his wife's photo and thinking about the opportunistic behaviour of his siblings and the meaninglessness of life.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Rajinikanth]] as Santhanam\n*[[Fatafat Jayalaxmi]] as Lakshmi\n*[[Cho Ramaswamy|Cho]] as Alagappan\n*Sangeetha as Amutha\n*[[Thengai Srinivasan]]  as Santhanam's father\n*[[Jaya Guhanathan|Jaya]] as Santhanam's sister\n*[[T.
