One hypothesis attributed differences in gender roles to [[evolution]]. The [[sociobiology]] view argues that men's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] is increased by being aggressive, allowing them to compete with other men for access to females, as well as by being sexually promiscuous and trying to father as many children as possible. Women are benefited by bonding with infants and caring for children.<ref name=\"Lindsey\"/> Sociobiologists argue that these evolutionary roles led to the establishment of traditional gender roles with women in the domestic sphere and men dominant in every other area.<ref name=\"Lindsey\">{{cite book| last=Lindsey| first= L.

This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"[[saint]]s\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture.

Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]].

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the \"private sphere\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres?

Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, \"Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female).

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47\u201370</ref> In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are [[Sex differences in humans|biologically determined]], and to what extent they are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].\n\nVarious groups, most notably the [[Feminism|feminist]] movements, have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate.\n\nThe term ''gender role'' was first used by [[John Money]] and colleagues in 1954, during the course of his study of [[intersex]] individuals, to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a [[male]] or [[female]] in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed.<ref>{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2018 | title = Know Thy Gender: Etymological Primer | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 2149\u20132154 | issn = 0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-018-1300-x| pmid = 30182204 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Gender expression}}\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines gender roles as \"socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women\".<ref name=\"WHO\">{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |title=What do we mean by \"sex\" and \"gender\"? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=WHO.int |publisher=World Health Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818074425/http://apps.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html |archivedate=18 August 2015 |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> Debate continues as to what extent gender and gender roles are socially constructed (i.e. non-biologically influenced), and to what extent \"socially constructed\" may be considered synonymous with \"arbitrary\" or \"malleable\".<ref>The social construction of race.

This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].\n\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\n\nChristian traditions that officially recognize \"[[saint]]s\", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"[[Theotokos]]\", i.e. \"Mother of God\", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. \nWomen prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.\n\n====Islam====\n{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}\n\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dhami |first1=Sangeeta |title=The Muslim family |journal=West J Med |date=Nov 2000 |volume=173 |issue=5 |pages=352\u2013356 |pmid=11069879 |pmc=1071164 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.173.5.352 }}</ref> Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\n\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Offenhauer |first1=P. |title=Women in Islamic Societies: A selected review of social scientific literature |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Women_Islamic_Societies.pdf}}</ref> In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\n\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress \"[[modesty|modestly]]\" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.\n\n[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n:<blockquote>\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'\"</blockquote>In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> How gender roles are honored is largely cultural.

It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.<ref name=\":1\" /> Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals.

The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179\u2013180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}</ref>\n\nIt has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]].

Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171\u2013180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}</ref>\n\n====Social Interaction====\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.<ref name=\":2\" /> Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.<ref name=\":2\" /> One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.<ref>Lindsey, L.

Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.<ref name=\":0\"/> Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.<ref name=\":0\"/> However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes.

In Asia, Hong Kong is very close to the USA because the female surgeons in these societies are focused heavily on home life, whereas Japan is focused more on work life.

A big change was seen in Hong Kong because the wives used to deal with a bad marriage. Now, Chinese wives have been divorcing their husbands when they feel unhappy with their marriage, and are stable financially. This makes the wife seem more in control of her own life, instead of letting her husband control her<ref name=\":5\" />. Other places, such as Singapore and Taipei are also seeing changes in gender roles. In many societies, but especially Singapore and Taipei, women have more jobs that have a leadership position (ie.

Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\n* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,\n* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and\n* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722\u201341 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede's 1980 findings, that \"high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment\", test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans.<ref>Hofstede</ref>{{Specify|date=July 2016}} This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.\n\nA study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.<ref name=\"Bag\"/> The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered ''''''inter'''''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\".<ref name=\"Bag\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641\u201372 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}</ref> The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\n\n==Communication==\n{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\n\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}</ref> Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.<ref>DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough.

In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females.

Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\n\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.<ref>Fischer, A. H. (2000). Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives.

Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.\n\nGender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.\n\nThe third was a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.<ref name=\"fagot\" />\n\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.\n\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them.

This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]].

Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\n\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the \"private sphere\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres?

According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"<ref>''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}</ref>\n\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]\u2019s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, \u201cabasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\u201d<ref>Shuttleworth, Sally. \"Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era.\" Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47\u201370</ref> In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\n\n===Men's rights===\n{{Main|Men's rights movement}}\n{{see also|Fathers' rights movement}}\n[[File:Save Indian Families protest (New Delhi, 26 August 2007).jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in New Delhi for men's rights organized by the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]]]]\n\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]].
