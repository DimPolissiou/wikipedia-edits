It is a [[Grade I listed building]] and a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]]. The castle saw much action during the wars between England and Scotland.\n[[File:Richard Norton of Norton of Norham Castle.jpg|thumb]]\n\n==Early history==\nThe castle was founded when [[Ranulf Flambard]], Bishop of Durham from 1099 to 1128, gave orders for its construction in 1121, in order to protect the property of the bishopric in north Northumberland, from incursions by the Scots.\n\nIn 1136 [[David I of Scotland]] invaded Northumberland and captured the castle. It was soon handed back to the bishopric, but was captured again in 1138 during another invasion. This time, the structure of the castle was substantially damaged. It remained derelict until [[Hugh de Puiset]], Bishop of Durham from 1153 to 1195, had the castle rebuilt. The work was probably directed by Richard of Wolviston, who was the bishop\u2019s architect.\n\nIn 1174 Hugh de Puiset supported the rebels in a revolt against [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], during which the Scottish king, [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] invaded Northumberland. The rebels were defeated and as a result, Bishop Hugh was forced to relinquish Norham Castle to the crown. The castle was administered by a constable appointed by the crown and garrisoned by royal soldiers. This continued until 1197, two years after Hugh\u2019s death, when it was restored to his successor, [[Philip of Poitou]]. The latter showed himself to be loyal to [[John of England|King John]]. When Philip died in 1208 the castle reverted to royal control.\n\n==Thirteenth century==\nIn 1209 the castle accommodated both King John and William the Lion, on an occasion when William did homage for his English lands to the English king. Between 1208 and 1211, King John maintained the castle defences in good order and provided a strong garrison. The strong defences were needed in 1215, when [[Alexander II of Scotland]], son of William the Lion, besieged the castle for forty days without success. In 1217 the castle was once again restored to the bishopric of Durham.\n\n[[Edward I of England|Edward I]], known as \u201cHammer of the Scots\u201d, visited the castle more than once. He did so in 1292 when [[John of Scotland|John Balliol]], King of Scotland did homage to him there. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, and during his campaign, his queen, [[Margaret of France, Queen of England|Marguerite of France]], remained at Norham Castle.\n\n==Fourteenth century==\nDuring the early fourteenth century, the Scots invaded Northumberland several times, but did not always attack Norham. In 1318 [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] besieged the castle for nearly a year. The Scottish army succeeded in occupying the outer ward for three days but were then driven out. The siege did not succeed. In 1319 the Scots returned and the castle successfully withstood a siege of seven months. In 1322 there was yet another unsuccessful Scottish siege. During all three sieges, the castle was under the command of Sir [[Thomas Grey (of Heaton)|Thomas Grey of Heton]], a knight who had been captured by the Scots at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, and who was father to the chronicler, [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Sir Thomas Grey]].\n\nIn 1327 a Scottish army captured Norham, but the castle was soon restored to [[Lewis de Beaumont]], [[Bishop of Durham]], when peace was declared.\n\n==Fifteenth century==\nAlthough the first half of the fifteenth century proved to be quieter than the previous one, the castle\u2019s defences were kept in good repair. The next major activity that the castle saw was during the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487). In 1462 Norham Castle was held by the [[House of York|Yorkists]] on behalf of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. The following year a [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] army besieged the castle for eighteen days until it was relieved by Yorkist forces. In 1464 the forces holding Norham castle changed sides to support the Lancastrians but were then forced to surrender to a force of Yorkists.\n\nLater in the century, Bishop [[Richard Foxe]] of Durham (1494\u20131501) had the castle\u2019s defences strengthened once more. In 1497 the castle was besieged for two weeks by an army led by [[James IV of Scotland]]. The siege included the use of artillery to try to breach the walls but the garrison was finally relieved by an English army. Following this latest siege the castle was repaired again. One of the guns used in the siege was a 22-inch (56&nbsp;cm) calibre cannon called [[Mons Meg]], which is now located at [[Edinburgh Castle]].\n\n==Sixteenth century==\nIn 1513 [[James IV of Scotland]] invaded England again with a powerful army that included artillery. He crossed the border and moved on Norham. His guns pounded the outer defences for several days until the outer ward was taken by the Scots. Soon after, the castle surrendered. By then most of the outer walls had been destroyed. Weeks later, James was defeated and slain at the [[Battle of Flodden]], near [[Branxton, Northumberland|Branxton]] in Northumberland, and Norham fell into English hands again.\n\nThe castle was inspected by [[Cardinal Wolsey]]'s chaplain William Frankelayn on 29 August 1515. He found it \"well fortitified with [[Contramure|contremurs]] and [[Breech-loading swivel gun|murderers]].\" The wall from the \"dungeoun\" (the Keep) running south west towards the kitchen was 28 feet thick. At this time, Scotland's [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Regent Albany]] was planning to bring an army against the [[Clan Hume|Hume family]] on the Scottish borders.<ref>''Letters & Papers of Henry VIII'', vol.2 (1864), no.861.</ref>\n\nBishop [[Thomas Ruthall]] of Durham inspected the castle and began restoration work.

However, in Turkish it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter ''i'', [[Dotted and dotless I|with and without a dot]].  Also, in Japanese [[syllabary|syllabaries]], a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfill the role of [[diacritic]]s, to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs.  In general, a diacritic is a glyph, even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a [[cedilla]] in French, the [[ogonek]] in several languages, or the stroke on a Polish \"[[\u0141]]\".\n\nSome characters such as \"[[\u00e6]]\" in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the \"[[\u00df]]\" in [[German language|German]] may be regarded as glyphs. They were originally [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s, but over time have become characters in their own right; these languages treat them as separate letters. However, a ligature such as \"\u017fi\", that is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a quirk of the typeface, essentially an [[allograph]]ic feature, and includes more than one [[grapheme]]. In normal handwriting, even long words are often written \"joined up\", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.\n\nTwo or more glyphs which have the same significance, whether used interchangeably or chosen depending on context, are called [[allograph]]s of each other.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term has been used in English since 1727, borrowed from ''glyphe'' (in use by French antiquaries since 1701), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03c6\u03ae, ''glyph\u0113'', \"carving,\" and the verb \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, ''gl\u00fdphein'', \"to hollow out, engrave, carve\" (cognate with Latin ''glubere'' \"to peel\" and English ''cleave'').<ref>see the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] under headword \"cleave\" for the cited Greek etymology.</ref>\n\nThe word ''[[hieroglyph]]'' (Greek for sacred writing) has a longer history in English, dating from an early use in an English to Italian dictionary published by [[John Florio]] in 1598, referencing the  complex and mysterious characters of the Egyptian alphabet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/86804#eid1583426|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\nThe word ''glyph'' first came to widespread European attention with the engravings and lithographs from [[Frederick Catherwood]]'s drawings of undeciphered glyphs of the [[Maya civilization]] in the early 1840s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/maya.html|title=Maya|last=|first=|date=|website=Ancientscripts.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212062541/http://ancientscripts.com/maya.html|archive-date=12 December 2010|accessdate=6 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Graphonomics==\nIn [[graphonomics]], the term glyph is used for a noncharacter, i.e. either a subcharacter or multicharacter pattern. Most typographic glyphs originate from the characters of a [[typeface]]. In a typeface each character typically corresponds to a single glyph, but there are exceptions, such as a font used for a language with a large alphabet or complex writing system, where one character may correspond to several glyphs, or several characters to one glyph.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:MAYA-g-log-cal-D10-Ok.svg|thumb|right|[[Maya script|Mayan glyph]] for Day 10 of the [[tzolkin]] calendar]]\nIn archaeology, a glyph is a carved or inscribed symbol.

If there is more than one allograph of a unit of writing, and the choice between them depends on context or on the preference of the author, they now have to be treated as separate glyphs, because mechanical arrangements have to be available to differentiate between them and to print whichever of them is required. The same is true in [[computing]]. In computing as well as typography, the term \"[[character (computing)|character]]\" refers to a grapheme or grapheme-like unit of text, as found in [[natural language]] [[writing system]]s (''scripts''). In typography and computing, the range of graphemes is broader than in a written language in other ways too: a typographical [[font]] often has to cope with a range of different languages each of which contribute their own graphemes, and it may also be required to print other symbols such as [[dingbat]]s.

The party was interrupted by Arina and Etelgar's arrival as Victory and Ginga fought the giant demon but to no avail. Musashi joined the UPG and managed to warn the Ultras to cancel their transformations before Arina seal them on time. During the team's recuperation and Musashi's introduction, Etelgar attacked the vicinity of Live Base as Arina fought the UPG members and Sho's attack brought her to her senses. However, the golden being had fabricated her memory into a trauma centered around Ginga and put her under her control once more. Zero fought Etelgar but even his strongest attack was easily shrugged off and only forced the latter to escape out of annoyance while Arina placed the captured Ultras on a hostage situation towards Hikaru. While the UPG members went to infiltrate the Space Time Castle, Hikaru and Sho were placed under Zero's tutelage. The success of their training taught them to cooperate and this allowed the UPG members to escape from Arina's fear-inducing influences and break the Ultras free from their imprisonment. Musashi rejoined with Cosmos and the rest of the Heisei Ultras empower the Ultra Fusion Brace.\n\nAs things went beyond his expectations, Etelgar manipulated the citizens' fears and created a gigantic copy of Dark Lugiel. Hikaru and Sho perform the Ultra Touch and bring forth an Ultra Warrior resulted from their alter-ego's combination: Ultraman Ginga Victory. The new figure easily phased through Dark Lugiel's attack and destroyed it via Ginga Victory Breaker. Joined by the rest of the Heisei Ultra Warriors, the group marched towards the tower, but Etelgar created multiple copies of their past enemies, leaving Cosmos and Ginga Victory to reach the upper level. Etelgar and Arina attacked them with their full strength until Cosmos assumed Eclipse Mode, purifying Arina from Etelgar's influence. Through Hikaru's persuasion, Arina manages to regain her memories and finally brought by Cosmos from safety, as Ginga Victory resumes battle. The other Ultra Warriors emerge victorious from their battles and Ginga Victory chased Etelgar to space, now finally realised his true motives behind the captures of the Ultra Warriors, which is due to their bonds with humanity before finishing him for good with Ultra Fusion Shoot. The rest of the Ultra Warriors soon destroyed the Space Time Castle with Crossover Formation.\n\nWith the rest of the Heisei Ultras return, Musashi/Cosmos volunteer to deliver Arina to her home after entrusting the safety of the Earth to UPG, Hikaru and Sho. Sho was later recruited into the ranks of UPG and the rest of the crew saluted to the viewers after the ending credits roll.\n\n==Production==\nThis movie is first announced in November 2014.

The party was interrupted by Arina and Etelgar's arrival as Victory and Ginga fought the giant demon but to no avail. Musashi joined the UPG and managed to warn the Ultras to cancel their transformations before Arina seal them on time. During the team's recuperation and Musashi's introduction, Etelgar attacked the vicinity of Live Base as Arina fought the UPG members and Sho's attack brought her to her senses. However, the golden being had fabricated her memory into a trauma centered around Ginga and put her under her control once more. Zero fought Etelgar but even his strongest attack was easily shrugged off and only forced the latter to escape out of annoyance while Arina placed the captured Ultras on a hostage situation towards Hikaru. While the UPG members went to infiltrate the Space Time Castle, Hikaru and Sho were placed under Zero's tutelage. The success of their training taught them to cooperate and this allowed the UPG members to escape from Arina's fear-inducing influences and break the Ultras free from their imprisonment. Musashi rejoined with Cosmos and the rest of the Heisei Ultras empower the Ultra Fusion Brace.\n\nAs things went beyond his expectations, Etelgar manipulated the citizens' fears and created a gigantic copy of Dark Lugiel. Hikaru and Sho perform the Ultra Touch and bring forth an Ultra Warrior resulted from their alter-ego's combination: Ultraman Ginga Victory. The new figure easily phased through Dark Lugiel's attack and destroyed it via Ginga Victory Breaker. Joined by the rest of the Heisei Ultra Warriors, the group marched towards the tower, but Etelgar created multiple copies of their past enemies, leaving Cosmos and Ginga Victory to reach the upper level. Etelgar and Arina attacked them with their full strength until Cosmos assumed Eclipse Mode, purifying Arina from Etelgar's influence. Through Hikaru's persuasion, Arina manages to regain her memories and finally brought by Cosmos from safety, as Ginga Victory resumes battle. The other Ultra Warriors emerge victorious from their battles and Ginga Victory chased Etelgar to space, now finally realised his true motives behind the captures of the Ultra Warriors, which is due to their bonds with humanity before finishing him for good with Ultra Fusion Shoot. The rest of the Ultra Warriors soon destroyed the Space Time Castle with Crossover Formation.\n\nWith the rest of the Heisei Ultras return, Musashi/Cosmos volunteer to deliver Arina to her home after entrusting the safety of the Earth to UPG, Hikaru and Sho. Sho was later recruited into the ranks of UPG and the rest of the crew saluted to the viewers after the ending credits roll.\n\n==Production==\nThis movie is first announced in November 2014. Takuya Negishi, actor of Hikaru Raid\u014d stated that his favorite Ultraman as a child is Ultraman Cosmos and is delighted to work alongside Musashi's actor, Taiyo Sugiura.<ref name =

This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that transgender people suffer from GID; this misinterpretation has greatly confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GID. Moreover, GID is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy or transitioning.  Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors of such others as legal entities does not indicate GID. GID does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].<ref name=\"Brown&Rounsley\" />\n\nClinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this population of individuals.<ref name=\"L.

A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of dealing with stigma and experiencing [[transphobia]] pushes many transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life, as one trans woman reflected: \"Transgendered individuals are going to come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do, specifically, with being transgendered.

One trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training: \"Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe that's it.

This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that transgender people suffer from GID; this misinterpretation has greatly confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GID. Moreover, GID is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy or transitioning.  Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors of such others as legal entities does not indicate GID. GID does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].<ref name=\"Brown&Rounsley\" />\n\nClinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this population of individuals.<ref name=\"L.

A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of dealing with stigma and experiencing [[transphobia]] pushes many transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life, as one trans woman reflected: \"Transgendered individuals are going to come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do, specifically, with being transgendered.

One trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training: \"Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe that's it.
