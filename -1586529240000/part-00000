The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to reduce the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing shortages of water.\n\nWater resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,\u00ac000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population.\n\n[[Water supply and sanitation in Yemen|Water availability in Yemen]] has decreased.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |title=The Water Crisis in Yemen: Causes, Consequences and Solutions |author=Nicole Glass |journal=Global Majority e-Journal |volume=1 |date=June 2010 |pages=17\u201330 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206093845/https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2016  }}</ref> Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen.

Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the country's resources. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens.<ref name=\"Rageh\">{{Cite

The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to reduce the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis.\n\nThe Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing shortages of water.\n\nWater resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,\u00ac000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population.\n\n[[Water supply and sanitation in Yemen|Water availability in Yemen]] has decreased.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |title=The Water Crisis in Yemen: Causes, Consequences and Solutions |author=Nicole Glass |journal=Global Majority e-Journal |volume=1 |date=June 2010 |pages=17\u201330 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206093845/https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/global_majority_e_journal_1-1_glass.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2016  }}</ref> Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen.

Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the country's resources. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens.<ref name=\"Rageh\">{{Cite

These included ''At The End of The Bay'', ''Canned Goods'' and ''Looking For The World''. At the beginning of his career, he was introduced to Edward Bond who became, and still is, a supporter of his work.\n\nBefore taking up a residency at Theatr Clwyd in 1989 and producing the play ''the fourth world'', Edwards worked with The Haymarket Theatre in Leicester where his productions were ''Long To Rain Over Us'' and ''Low People''.\n\nAt this time Edwards began to be published by Oberon Books Ltd., London. Its publishing editor, James Hogan, encouraged The Citizens' Theatre, Glasgow to produce his play ''Casanova Undone'' which was followed a year later by ''Wittgenstein's Daughter''. Both were subsequently produced at The White Bear Theatre in London.\n\nIn the early 1990s Edwards worked with Mark Dornford May at Broomhill which resulted in the opera ''The Juniper Tree'', written with composer Andew Toovey and ''The Beggar's New Clothes'', a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', with music by Warren Belshaw. The latter transferred to The Cockpit Theatre, London.\n\nEdwards returned to working in Wales with [[Sgript Cymru]] and in 2002 his comedy ''Franco's Bastard'' was produced at Chapter Arts Centre. The play revisits Edwards' time as a young student at Lampeter University when he met the Welsh Nationalist activist and leader of the right wing Free Wales Army, Juian Cayo Evans. During a political falling out, the socialist Edwards was attacked by Evans and a fellow member of the FWA, which resulted in a month's stay at Chepstow Hospital where Edwards' head injuries were treated. The play centres on a sometimes scathing and sometimes affectionate account of the charismatic Evans.

Poorly placed temperature sensors indicated the reactor was cooling rather than heating. The excess heat led to the failure of a nuclear cartridge, which in turn allowed uranium and irradiated graphite to react with air. The resulting fire burned for days, damaging a significant portion of the reactor core. About 150 burning fuel cells could not be removed from the core, but operators succeeded in creating a [[firebreak]] by removing nearby fuel cells. An effort to cool the graphite core with water and the switching off of the air cooling system eventually quenched the fire. The reactor had released radioactive gases into the surrounding countryside, primarily in the form of [[iodine-131]] (<sup>131</sup>I). [[Milk]] distribution was banned in a {{convert|200|sqmi|adj=on}} area around the reactor for several weeks. A 1987 report by the [[National Radiological Protection Board]] predicted the accident would cause as many as 33 long-term cancer deaths, although the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council Committee]] concluded that \"it is in the highest degree unlikely that any harm has been done to the health of anybody, whether a worker in the Windscale plant or a member of the general public.\" The reactor that burned was one of two air-cooled, graphite-moderated natural uranium reactors at the site used for production of [[plutonium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nucleartourist.com/events/windscal.htm|title=Windscale Nuclear Incident|date=2005-12-22|work=The Virtual Nuclear Tourist|accessdate=2007-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424074257/http://www.nucleartourist.com/events/windscal.htm|archive-date=2006-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakestay.co.uk/1957.htm|title=The 1957 Windscale Fire|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/uk/sellafield.htm|title=Sellafield|date=2005-04-28|work=United Kingdom Nuclear Forces|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>\n|-\n|October 11, 1957 \n|[[Homestead Air Force Base]], Florida\n|Nuclear bomb burned after B-47 aircraft accident\n|B-47 aircraft crashed during take-off after a wheel exploded; one nuclear bomb burned in the resulting fire.<ref name=\"DOD1981\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/reading_room/21.pdf|title=Narrative Summary of Accidents Involving U.S. Nuclear Weapons 1950\u20131980|date=April 1981|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528154819/http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/reading_room/21.pdf|archivedate=2010-05-28|accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>\n|-\n|January 31, 1958\n|[[Morocco]]\n|Nuclear bomb damaged in crash<ref name=\"DOD1981\" />\n|During a simulated takeoff, a wheel casting failure caused the tail of a [[U.S. Air Force|USAF]] B-47 carrying an armed nuclear weapon to hit the runway, rupturing a fuel tank and sparking a fire.

Technicians mistakenly overheated Windscale [[Pile (nuclear reactor)|Pile]] No. 1 during an [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] process to release [[Wigner energy]] from [[graphite]] portions of the reactor. Poorly placed temperature sensors indicated the reactor was cooling rather than heating. The excess heat led to the failure of a nuclear cartridge, which in turn allowed uranium and irradiated graphite to react with air. The resulting fire burned for days, damaging a significant portion of the reactor core. About 150 burning fuel cells could not be removed from the core, but operators succeeded in creating a [[firebreak]] by removing nearby fuel cells. An effort to cool the graphite core with water and the switching off of the air cooling system eventually quenched the fire. The reactor had released radioactive gases into the surrounding countryside, primarily in the form of [[iodine-131]] (<sup>131</sup>I). [[Milk]] distribution was banned in a {{convert|200|sqmi|adj=on}} area around the reactor for several weeks.

The U.S. Navy conducted a three-month search involving 12,000 men and successfully recovered the fourth bomb.
