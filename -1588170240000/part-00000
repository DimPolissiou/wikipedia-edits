The day of Christmas, and in some cases [[Christmas Eve|the day before]] and [[Boxing Day|the day after]], are recognized by many national [[government]]s and [[culture]]s worldwide, including in areas where [[Christianity]] is a [[minority group|minority]] religion. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday.\n\n[[Christmas traditions]] for many nations include the installing and lighting of [[Christmas tree]]s, the hanging of [[Advent wreath]]s, [[Christmas stocking]]s, [[candy cane]]s, setting out cookies and milk, and the creation of [[Nativity scene]]s depicting the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Christmas carol]]s may be sung and stories told about such figures as the [[Baby Jesus]], [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas]], [[Santa Claus]], [[Father Christmas]], [[Christkind]] or [[Ded Moroz|Grandfather Frost]]. The sending and exchange of [[Christmas card]] greetings, observance of [[fasting]] and special religious observances such as a midnight [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or [[Vespers]] on [[Christmas Eve]], the burning of a [[Yule log]], and the [[History of Christmas Gift Giving|giving and receiving of presents]] are also common practice. Along with [[Easter]], Christmas is one of the most important periods on the Christian calendar, and is often closely connected to other holidays at this time of year, such as [[Advent]], the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]], [[St Nicholas Day]], [[St. Stephen's Day]], [[New Year]]'s, and the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Christmas.aspx|title=Christmas|publisher=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Countries that recognize Christmas as a Public Holiday.png|thumb|float=right|upright=2.0|Map of countries where Christmas is a formal public holiday either on December 24/25 or January 6/7.

Countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bhutan, Cambodia, China (excepting Hong Kong and [[Macau]]), the Comoros, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, the Maldives, Mauritania, Mongolia, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, the [[Sahrawi Republic]], Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is not a public holiday but is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.\n\nChristmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.

They then head to church at dawn on Christmas morning. On Christmas Day, there will be colorful musical celebrations which involve the priests dressed in their best robes performing rituals, including dancing and playing drums and other instruments. Early in the morning at dawn, everyone dresses in white and head to the nearby church. Late in the afternoon there will be the traditional game of [[Gena]], a kind of hockey. According to an Ethiopian legend, the game was being played by the shepherds who were tending their flocks on the night that Jesus was born. The game is attended by the leader of the community. A prize is awarded to the winner of the Gena game.

Family members dine together around 12 midnight on traditional [[Nochebuena]] fare, which may include: ''[[queso de bola]]'' (English: \"ball of cheese\"; this is actually [[edam cheese]]), ''tsokolate'' (a hot chocolate drink), and ''[[jam\u00f3n]]'' (Christmas ham), ''[[lechon|lech\u00f3n]]'', roast chicken or turkey, pasta, ''relleno'' (stuffed ''[[Milkfish|bangus]]'' or chicken), ''[[pan de sal]]'', and various desserts including cakes and the ubiquitous fruit salad.

The loud noises and sounds of merrymaking are also supposed to drive away bad spirits. Safer methods of merrymaking include banging on pots and pans and blowing on car horns. Folk beliefs also include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight in the belief that they will grow up tall, displaying circular fruit and wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolize money, eating twelve grapes at 12 midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year, and opening windows and doors during the first day of the New Year to let in good luck.\n\nChristmas officially ends on the Feast of the Three Kings (''Tres Reyes'' in Spanish or ''Tatlong Hari'' in Tagalog), also known as the [[Feast of the Epiphany]] (Spanish: ''Fiesta de Epifan\u00eda''). The Feast of the Three Kings was traditionally commemorated on January 6 but is now celebrated on the first Sunday after the New Year.

When the Gregorian calendar was implemented in 1582, the Armenians rejected the reformed calendar and remained following the Julian Calendar. But today, only Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem still uses the Julian Calendar.

Christmas Eve is particularly rich in traditions. Families gather for the Christmas Eve dinner (''khetum'', \u053d\u0569\u0578\u0582\u0574), which generally consists of: rice, fish, ''nevik'' (\u0576\u0578\u0582\u056b\u056f, a vegetable dish of green chard and chick peas), and yogurt/wheat soup (''tanabur'', \u0569\u0561\u0576\u0561\u057a\u0578\u0582\u0580). Dessert includes dried fruits and nuts, including ''rojik'', which consists of whole shelled walnuts threaded on a string and encased in grape jelly, ''bastukh'' (a paper-like confection of grape jelly, cornstarch, and flour), etc. This lighter menu is designed to ease the stomach off the week-long fast and prepare it for the rather more substantial Christmas Day dinner.

Assyrians colloquially call Christmas ''Eda Zora,'' meaning \"little holiday.\" It is officially called ''Eda d'Yalde'' which means \"birthday holiday.\" Traditionally, Assyrians fast (''sawma'') from December 1 until Christmas Day. In Iraq, for instance, on Christmas Eve, Assyrian families congregate outside of their house and hold lighted candles while a child reads aloud the nativity story. Then they all sing psalms over a bonfire made of thorn bushes. Folklore says that if the thorns burn to ashes, the family will have good luck. After the fire has been reduced to ashes, the family members will jump three times over the ashes and make a wish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|title=Christmas Traditions|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207065201/http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|archivedate=December 7, 2014}}</ref> The next day, on Christmas, \"as another bonfire burns in the churchyard, the bishops lead the service while carrying a figure of the baby Jesus.

On Christmas Day, when families gather together after the ''Shaharta'' or morning mass, ''raza d'mowlada d'maran,'' the fast is broken by eating traditional Assyrian foods such as ''pacha/reesh-aqle'' (meaning \"from the head to the tail\"), which is a boiled soup made of sheep or cow intestines, tongue, stomach, legs, and spices or ''harissa'', a porridge made of ground wheat and chicken (both dishes are prepared usually overnight). These two dishes are only made twice a year: on Christmas and Easter. Traditional desserts eaten after the main course include Killeche, a date and walnut-stuffed cookie, and Kadeh, another stuffed pastry. After the feast is finished, Assyrians will visit the houses of family and friends to exchange Christmas greetings, saying, \"''Eedokhon breekha,''\" meaning \"May your feast be blessed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-ix-assyrian/|title=FESTIVALS ix.Assyrian|author=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=2012}}</ref> There, the host will serve tea, Turkish coffee, and Killeche and Kadeh to guests.

Unlike in the North American and Anglo-Saxon tradition, Christmas takes action mainly near midnight, usually with big family dinners, opening of gifts and the celebration of the \"Missa do Galo\" (the rooster's mass) in churches throughout the nation.\n\nMany Brazilians decorate their homes with a Christmas Tree, there is no rule, the parents can decorate it by themselves as a surprise to the kids, or they can do it together. In addition to the Christmas tree, many families set up a Nativity scene as the main decoration. Nativity scenes are very popular in Brazil, and can be seen everywhere including churches and popular places around the town. Like many other countries, Christmas dinner in Brazil is normally served late in the evening on Christmas Eve around 10 or 11 p.m. The meal often includes farofa stuffing, assortments of fruit, fried cod, and roast turkey with a dessert called \"[[rabanada]]\". Along with their meals, Brazilians typically drink champagne, wine, and fruit punch. Typically after they eat, many Brazilians attend a Midnight Mass service or watch the Pope's television broadcast celebration of \"Midnight Mass in Rome\" with family and friends.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1159225.Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|title=Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|publisher=www.goodreads.com|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===== Colombia =====\n[[File:Christmas2004inMedell\u00edn.JPG|thumb|[[Medell\u00edn River]] during the [[Christmas lights in Medell\u00edn|Lighting of Medellin]]]]\n\nChristmas is a [[Public holidays in Colombia|public holiday in Colombia]] and is primarily a religious celebration. Presents are brought by ''El Ni\u00f1o Jesus / Ni\u00f1o Dios'' (Baby Jesus).\n\nWhile Christmas decorations may be put up as early as the beginning of November, the unofficial start of Colombian Christmas festivities takes place on December 7, [[D\u00eda de las Velitas]], or \"Day of the Candles.\" At night, the streets, sidewalks, balconies, porches, and driveways are decorated with candles and paper lanterns, which illuminate cities and towns in a yellow glow to honor the Immaculate Conception on the following day, December 8. In many cities, and even in small rural towns, neighborhoods get together and decorate their whole neighborhood or street, turning streets into virtual \"tunnels of light.\" Many radio stations and local organizations hold contests for the best display of lights, making the competition for the best light show a serious event. The city of Medell\u00edn has become a popular tourist destination during the holiday season because of its [[Christmas lights in Medell\u00edn|Christmas lights]]. Activities such as musical events and firework displays are planned by cities and held during this time. Individually launched fireworks were a common item during the Christmas season in Colombia, often going on at any time of the day in many cities. However, a recent ban has decreased the individual use of fireworks, and now only cities or towns are able to hold firework displays.\n\nDecember 16 is the first day of the Christmas [[Novena]], a devotion consisting of prayer said on nine successive days, the last one held on Christmas Eve. The Novena is promoted by the Catholic Church as a staple of Christmas, and is very similar to the [[Las Posadas|posadas]] celebrated in Mexico. It is a call for an understanding of the religious meaning of Christmas, and a way to counter the commercialism of the Christmas season. Individual traditions concerning the Novena may vary, but most families set up a \"pesebre\" (manger scene), sing religious Christmas carols called [[villancicos]] accompanied by tambourines, bells, and other simple percussion instruments, and read verses from the Bible as well as an interpretation which may change from year to year. Novenas serve as beautiful religious gatherings as well as learning environments for young children since kids have a central and active role in the celebration of the Novenas (they read prayers, sing, and play instruments guided by their family). From December 16 to 24, games called \"aguinaldos\"<ref name=\"aguinaldos-colombia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-178186.html|title=Colombia Aprende \u2013 A jugar aguinaldos|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084849/http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-178186.html|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> are played after having made a \"pinky promise\" deciding the prize for the winner and the punishment for the loser. The games include \"Hablar y no contestar\" (Talk but don't answer), \"D\u00e9 pero no reciben\" (Give but don't receive), \"Pajita en boca\" (Straw in the mouth), \"Tres pies\" (Three feet), \"Beso robado\" (Stolen kisses), and \"Si y al no\" (Yes or no). Churches offer dawn and nightly masses during the nine days of the novena, culminating with the [[Misa de Gallo]] (Rooster's Mass) on Christmas Eve at midnight.\n\nChristmas Eve is the most important day of Christmas in Colombia. Families and friends get together to pray the last Novena and wait until midnight to open the presents, parties are held until sunrise on [[Christmas Day]], kids stay up late playing with their new presents, and fireworks fill the skies. Families gather around meals, music, and singing. Because Christmas Eve is the most important day, little occurs on December 25. Families join Christmas Day mass although it is not nearly as festive as Christmas Eve.\n\nThe \"Dia de los Santos Inocentes\", or the [[Day of the Innocents]], falls in the Christmas season, on December 28. The day commemorates the innocent infants (called the innocent ones) who were said to have been killed by [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in fear of the power of the newborn baby, Jesus. January 6, the day of the Revelation of the Magi (Epiphany), is called \"Reyes Magos\" (from [[The Three Magi]]), used to be a day of gift giving, but is celebrated less now since gifts are given mostly around Christmas Eve today. Some families still give presents, and it is also the day when godparents give Christmas presents.\n\n===== El Salvador =====\nChristmas for El Salvador still carries a strong meaning that brings families together. Despite the business on the streets and the red, green and white colors flooding the environment, Salvadoran people try to honor what they consider to be the true meaning of Christmas, the birth of Jesus.\nIn El Salvador children celebrate Christmas by playing with [[firecracker]]s, fountains, such as the small ''volcancitos'' (\"little volcanos\") and sparklers, ''estrellitas'' (\"little stars\"). Teenagers and young adults display bigger [[fireworks]] or [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman Candle]]s. Families also have parties in which they dance and eat. \nSanta Claus is known for appearing in TV and print ads, but people ask children if they already wrote a letter to little baby Jesus. Traditional Salvadoran Christmas dishes are sauteed turkey sandwiches in a baguette with lettuce and radishes, [[Salvadoran Tamales]], and sweet bread for dessert. Drinks include [[hot chocolate]], [[pineapple]] juice, Salvadoran [[horchata]], Cherry Salvadoran horchata, and coffee. At 12:00&nbsp;a.m. on December 25 everyone gathers around the [[Christmas tree]] and opens their presents.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===== Guatemala =====\nOn Christmas in Guatemala, people [[Dress-Up|dress up]] in an ornamental hat, called a ''Puritina'', and dance in a line.

Mexico's\nChristmas is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople go from door to door in a fashion of when the parents of the unborn baby Jesus Christ looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a candy-filled [[pi\u00f1ata]].\n\nMexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the feast of La Guadalupana ([[Virgin of Guadalupe]]), and end on January 6, with the Epiphany. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around Christmas season into what is known as the [[Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon]]. At midnight on Christmas, many families place the figure of baby Jesus in their ''nacimientos'' ([[Nativity scene]]s), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole. In the center and south of Mexico, children receive gifts on Christmas Eve and on January 6, they celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men (3 Wizard Kings) brought gifts to Bethlehem for Jesus Christ. Santa Claus (or Santa Clos, as he's known in Mexico<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/mexicanchristmas.htm |title=Christmas in Mexico |work=Santas.net |publisher=Australian Media Pty Ltd. |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>) is who brings the children their gifts, but traditionally the Three Wise Men will fill the children's shoes with candies, oranges, tangerines, nuts, and sugar cane, and sometimes money or gold. For the Three Wise Men gave Baby Jesus Gold for his future.\n\n===== Venezuela =====\n[[File:Paradura del ni\u00f1o, Baruta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Different moments of [[Paradura del Ni\u00f1o]], Venezuelan tradition celebrated on February 2]]\n\nIn Venezuela, Christmas is celebrated as a religious occasion. As in Colombia, the presents are brought by \"El Ni\u00f1o Jesus\" (Baby Jesus) instead of \"Pap\u00e1 No\u00e9l\" (Santa Claus), that still has an important role during this season.\n\nThe unofficial start of the Christmas festivities is after the celebrations of \"[[Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1#Annual Celebration|Feria de la Chinita]]\", the second half of November. The origin of this festival is the cult to Virgin Mary of [[Chiquinquir\u00e1]], when various religious activities, processions, and music in the typical \"[[Gaita (music style)|Gaita style]]\" to honor \"La [[Chinita]]\" (nickname of this Virgin). This event takes place in the Zulia Region, specifically in Maracaibo (the regional capital). After this, other cities join in the festivities and many activities take place including musical events and firework displays.\n\nIn many cities, small rural towns and neighborhoods get together for the \"patinatas\" night festivals where children go and play with skateboards, roller blades and bicycles. These events are usually sponsored by the local church, where neighbors organize themselves and sell typical Christmas food, hot chocolate, [[hallaca]], cookies, etc. Also still in some neighborhoods there is the \"[[Parranda]]\" where people go from one house to house with music and Christmas songs. The singers stops at neighbors' houses to get some food and drinks. Also in the Venezuelan Andes there is the same tradition of this kind of event but they carry an image of \"baby Jesus\" and this is called \"[[Paradura del Ni\u00f1o]].\" Children write request letters to Baby Jesus. The presents are sent by Baby Jesus at midnight, and most people have a party, which goes on until sunrise.\n\n==== Caribbean ====\n\n===== Bahamas =====\n[[Junkanoo]] festivals are held Boxing Day, December 26 and again on New Year's Day. It is a local cultural event dating back to it African heritage  featuring goat skin drums, cowbell and brass instruments with choreographed dancers dressed in traditional one of kind and handmaid colorful costumes, singing and dancing\n\nBahamian Christmas foods include benny cake, coconut cake, flour cake from Acklins and Cat Island, fruit cake, baked ham and turkey, traditional peas and rice, baked macaroni, coleslaw, plantains, fried fish, boiled fish (Nassau Grouper and snappers) and Johnny cake. Drinks like eggnog, lemonade and local beers (Kalik and Sands) are also served on Christmas.\n\n===== Cuba =====\nCuba had a long tradition of celebrating Christmas. Families used to gather at the dining table, and used to go to mass after dinner.\nThe Communist Regime led by Fidel Castro abolished the paid Christmas holiday in 1969, citing that workers were needed to continue the sugar harvest. In 1998, the Regime declared December 25 a leisure day, as requested by Pope John Paul II as a condition to visit the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/cuba-ends-its-30year-ban-on-christmas-1193525.html|title=Cuba ends its 30-year ban on Christmas|work=The Independent}}</ref> It is a one-day public holiday and it is celebrated only in the evening.\n\n===== Jamaica =====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nRadio stations play Christmas carols as early as October, reggae style and some international. Jamaicans paint their houses and hang new curtains for Christmas. Pepper lights, the local name for Christmas lights, go up even on trees.\n\n[[Junkanoo]] or John Canoe is a traditional Christmas celebration in Jamaica, influenced by African ancestors. This includes street dancing and a great parade through the streets with Jamaicans dressed in colorful masquerade costumes in which masks are worn.\n\nThe traditional Jamaican Christmas meal includes [[ackee]], saltfish, breadfruit, fried plantains, boiled bananas, freshly squeezed fruit juice and tea for breakfast; chicken, [[curried goat]], stewed oxtail, rice and [[gungo peas]] for dinner. For dessert, [[sorrel drink]] and a Jamaican rum fruitcake along with red wine are served in many homes.\n\nMany people attend church for Christmas Eve or Christmas morning worship service.\n\nSome people to go the Christmas Eve Grand Market, where you walk with family and friends and buy whatever you want and go home 2:00 or 3:00&nbsp;am Christmas Day.\n\nSome British Christmas traditions have stayed in Jamaica, like Father Christmas, roast beef or lamb dinners, Boxing Day, etc.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== Central Europe ====\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[File:Adventskranz von oben.jpg|thumb|Christmas wreath]]\n\nIn countries of Central Europe (for this purpose, roughly defined as the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and possibly other places) the main celebration date for the general public is Christmas Eve (December 24). The day is usually a fasting day; in some places children are told they'll see a ''golden pig'' if they hold fast until after dinner. When the evening comes preparation of Christmas Dinner starts. Traditions concerning dinner vary from region to region, for example, in Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, the prevailing meal is fried [[carp]] with potato salad and fish (or cabbage) soup. However, in some places the tradition is porridge with mushrooms (a modest dish), and elsewhere the dinner is exceptionally rich, with up to 12 dishes. This in fact reveals that when Christmas comes around all the kids get presents from neighbours and house guest. Even the house pet got a little something to gnaw on.\n\nAfter the dinner comes the time for gifts. Children usually find their gifts under the Christmas Tree, with name stickers. An interesting example of complicated history of the region is the \"fight\" between Christmas beings. During communism, when countries of Central Europe were under Soviet influence, communist authorities strongly pushed Russian traditional ''Ded Moroz'' (\"Grandfather Frost\") in the place of Little Jesus won. Now [[Santa Claus]] is attacking, by means of advertising and Hollywood film production. Many people, Christians as well as people with just a Christian background, go to [[Roman Catholic]] midnight mass celebration.\n\nOther common attributes of Christmas in Central Europe include Christmas trees, mistletoe, Christmas garlands, and Bethlehem cribs.\n\nIn many areas of Central Europe, St. Nicholas (Hungarian: Mikul\u00e1s, Czech: Mikul\u00e1\u0161, Polish: Miko\u0142aj, Slovak: Mikul\u00e1\u0161, Slovene: Miklav\u017e), or Santa Claus, does not come for Christmas. He visits families earlier, on the dawn of St. Nicholas Day on December 6, and for the well-behaved children he has presents and candy-bags to put into their well polished shoes that were set in the windows the previous evening. Although he neither parks his sleigh on rooftops nor climbs chimneys, his visits are usually accompanied by a diabolic-looking servant named Krampusz (in Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia: Krampus, in Czech and Slovak regions he is simply \"\u010dert\", i.e. devil, without any name) who gives golden coloured birches for so called badly behaved children. Actually all children get both gifts and golden birches (Hungarian: ''virg\u00e1cs'') in their shoes, no matter how they behaved themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |title=Hungarian Heritage Museum |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815122913/http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n===== Austria and Germany =====\n{{Main|Weihnachten}}\n\n[[File:Advent Bowl Rusch.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian Advent bowl]]\n\nIn some German-speaking communities, in the  German-speaking Europe; particularly in Catholic regions of western and southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, South Tyrol and Liechtenstein, as well as in other Catholic regions of Central Europe, the ''[[Christkind]]'' (literally \"Christ child\") brings the presents on the evening of December 24 (Holy Evening or Heiliger Abend).<ref name=forbes>Forbes, Bruce David, Christmas: a candid history, University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}</ref>{{rp|68\u201379}} The Christkind is invisible; thus he is never seen by anyone. However, he rings a bell just before he leaves in order to let children know that the Christmas tree and the presents are ready.\n\nIt is a tradition to lavishly decorate a Christmas tree in the days directly before Christmas or on the morning of Christmas Eve. On late Christmas Eve, after the bell rings, the tree is shown to the children and presents are exchanged.\n\nIn [[Protestant church]]es, there is a service in the late afternoon intended to immediately precede the [[Christmas Eve]] meal and the exchanging of gifts. This service, called ''Christvesper'', consists most often of scriptural readings, the Christmas Gospel from Luke 2, a ''Krippenspiel'' (nativity play), favourite Christmas carols and festive music for organ and choirs. In some regions the tradition of ''[[Quempas]] singing'' is still popular. Some Lutheran churches also celebrate a candlelight service at midnight besides the Christmas Vespers in the afternoon or early evening.\n\nMany Catholic churches also have a first Mass of Christmas, called ''Christmette'', on \"Heiliger Abend\" about 4&nbsp;p.m. for the children and parents to attend before the families return home for their meal. The crib is a very important part of the celebrations in Catholic areas especially [[Bavaria]].\n\n====== Austria ======\n\n[[File:Wien Rathaus Christkindlmarkt Dez2006B.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas market in front of the town hall in [[Vienna]], Austria]]\n\nIn the largely Catholic Austria, [[Christmas markets]] are a long-standing tradition. In [[Vienna]], for instance, the market is held in the large square in front of City Hall. [[Innsbruck]] opens its romantic Christmas market in the narrow medieval square at the foot of the Golden Roof. In [[Salzburg]], the Christmas market takes over the square in front of the Cathedral with its picturesque stalls, while the tree vendors occupy Residenzplatz on the side of the huge Cathedral. However almost every small town has its own Christmas market.\n\nIn Austria, Christmas trees play a very important part of Christmas celebrations. Every town sets up its own huge tree on the main square all decorated with candles, ornaments and candies and frequently there will be an extra one, adorned with bread crumbs, for the birds. In families the tree is decorated with gold and silver ornaments or stars made out of straw, sweets and candy wrapped in tinfoil, gilded nuts, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austria.info/us/people-and-traditions/christmas-season-in-austria-1084204.html|title=Christmas Season in Austria|work=austria.info|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe feast of [[St Nicholas]] marks the beginning of Christmas in Austria. On Christmas Eve (December 24) the tree is lit for the first time and the whole family gathers to sing [[Christmas carols]] like \"Silent Night, Holy Night\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/austria.shtml|title=Christmas in Austria|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Gifts that are placed under the tree are opened after dinner on Christmas Eve. Austrian Christmas tradition has it that it is the Christ Child himself who decorates the Christmas tree on [[Christmas Eve]] and brings the children their Christmas presents, and it is to him that their letters and wish lists are addressed in the weeks before Christmas. The Christmas Eve dinner is the main event of the night often served with fried carp. The famous [[sachertorte]] and different kinds of chocolates are served as dessert. The Austrians also have special crescent shaped cookies served during Christmas time.\n\n====== Germany ======\n[[File:Weihnachtssterne. Chemnitz. IMG 7242WI.jpg|thumb|[[Moravian star|Christmas star]]]]\n[[File:Bavarian Crib.JPG|thumb|Old Bavarian crib found in [[Magnus of F\u00fcssen|St Mang]] Basilica, [[F\u00fcssen]], [[Bavaria]]]]\n[[File:Christmas tree on the Potsdamer Platz (Sony Center) in Berlin, Germany.jpg|thumb|upright|Christmas tree in [[Berlin]], Germany]]\n\nIn Germany Christmas traditions vary by region. Till the reformation [[Saint Nicholas Day#St. Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas' Day]], December 6, Saint Nicholas was the main provider of Christmas presents. Nikolaus still puts goodies in children's shoes on that day. Sometimes St. Nicholas visits children in kindergarten, schools or at public events. They have to recite a short poem or sing a song in order to get sweets or a small gift. \"[[Knecht Ruprecht]]\" (the servant Ruprecht) \u2013 dressed in dark clothes with devil-like traits (usually noted as a long, bright red tongue and with a stick or a small whip in the hand) \u2013 sometimes accompanies St. Nicholas. His duty is to punish those children who haven't behaved during the year. Usually he doesn't have much to do. He merely stands near St. Nicholas as a warning to be good and polite. Nikolaus  as well for some Gl\u00fchwein for adults, there are some traditions connected with local firefighters, riders associations and church congregations.\n\nThe [[Sorbs]], a minority in Saxony and parts of Brandenbuerg with a language similar to Polish, have some specific traditions. E.g. in [[J\u00e4nschwalde]], the ''Bescherkind'' [[Jan\u0161ojski bog]] (\"presents kid\") is visiting the neighbors, a girl dressed in local costume and veil and goes around with two companions at the Wednesday before Christmas. It provides smaller presents like sweets, similar to the Nikolaus and provides blessings, stays however silent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bern.diplo.de/Vertretung/bern/de/12_20Adventskalender/17-_20sorbische_20Weihnachtsbraeuche.html|title=Deutsche Botschaft Bern|publisher=|access-date=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218064944/http://www.bern.diplo.de/Vertretung/bern/de/12_20Adventskalender/17-_20sorbische_20Weihnachtsbraeuche.html|archive-date=December 18, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another tradition in Saxony is related to the [[Wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains]], especially [[Seiffen]] provides Christmas related decorations like [[Christmas pyramid]] and toys around the year. [[Letters to Santa|Christmas letters]] may be addressed e.g. to [[Engelskirchen]] (Angel's church) or [[Himmelpforten]] (Heaven's gate) or some other in municipalities with matching names. After privatization, [[Deutsche Post]] kept the tradition of dedicated Christmas offices, one in each state, answering letters and requests from children.\n[[File:2014-12 Engel+Bergmann beleuchtet.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|Traditional [[Miner's figure]]s as Christmas  light bearers]]\nCurrently the actual Christmas gift-giving (German: \"Bescherung\") usually takes place on [[Christmas Eve]]. This tradition was introduced by [[Protestant Reformation|Reformator]], [[Martin Luther]], as he was of the opinion that one should put the emphasis on Christ's birth and not on a saint's day and do away with the connotation that gifts have to be earned by good behavior. The gifts should be seen as a symbol for the gift of God's grace in Christ.<ref>Ernst, Eugen: Weihnachten im Wandel der Zeiten, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2. Aufl. Darmstadt 2000, pp. 34 \u2013 35</ref> This tradition quickly became common in predominantly Catholic regions as well.\n\nGifts may be brought by the ''Weihnachtsmann'' (translation, \"Christmas man\"), who resembles either St. Nicholas or the [[American Santa Claus]], or by ''[[Christkind]]l'', a sprite-like child who may or may not represent the baby Jesus.<ref name=forbes/>{{rp|68\u201379}} Till 1930, there was sort of south north divide between the realms of southern and silesian Christkind and Nordic Weihnachtsmann. After the gifts are opened the children often stay up as late as they like, often till the early hours of the morning.\n\nThe Christmas Tree is first put up and decorated on the morning of the 24th. The gifts are then placed under the tree. Christmas services in the church serve as well to exchange greetings with neighbors and friends. After an evening meal one of the parents usually goes into the room where the tree is standing, lights the candles and rings a little bell. Then the children are allowed to go into the candlelit room. In many families it is still a custom to sing Christmas songs around the tree before opening up the presents. Some families attend a midnight church service \"Christmette\" after the evening meal and gift-giving.\n\nThe culinary feast either takes place at supper on Christmas Eve or on the first day of Christmas. Traditions vary from region to region; carp is eaten in many parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blcmasvoc.htm |title=German Christmas Vocabulary |publisher=German.about.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref> Potato salad with frankfurter or wiener-sausages is popular in some families. Another simple meal which some families favor, especially in regions where Christmas Eve still has the character of a [[fast day]], is vegetable or pea soup. In some regions, especially in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] where Danish influence is noticeable, a roasted duck or goose filled with plums, apples and raisins is family tradition. In other regions, especially in [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Pomerania]], many families prefer [[kale]] with boiled potatoes, special sausages and ham. Many families have developed new traditions for themselves and eat such meals as meat [[fondue]] or [[raclette]]. In almost all families in all parts of Germany you find a wide variety of Christmas cookies baked according to recipes typical for the family and the region.\n\n\"L\u00fcttenweihnachten\" describes the hunting and forestry custom of providing a Christmas tree with food decorated for animals.\n\n===== Czech Republic and Slovakia =====\n\n[[File:Christmas in Prague's Old Town Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Town Square]] in Prague, Czech Republic \u2013 Christmastime]]\n\n{{Main|Czech Christmas Mass}}\n\nChristmas Eve (December 24) is celebrated as ''\u0160t\u011bdr\u00fd den/\u0160tedr\u00fd de\u0148'', which means \"Generous Day\", when the gifts are given in the evening. The December 25 and 26 are [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic]] and [[Public holidays in Slovakia|in Slovakia]], but ''V\u00e1noce/Vianoce'' (Christmas), is most commonly associated with the 24th.\n\nAccording to tradition, gifts are brought by ''Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek/Je\u017ei\u0161ko'', or \"baby Jesus\". Fish soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad are a traditional dish for the dinner. In Slovakia, before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other by sharing a piece of Christmas wafer (Obl\u00e1tky) with honey and walnuts. Traditional dinner depends on region, but common Christmas dinner is cabbage soup (Kapustnica) or lentil soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad or hand made gnocchi with poppy (\u0161\u00fa\u013eanky s makom). The gifts are surreptitiously placed under the Christmas tree (usually a [[spruce]] or [[pine]] and lately fir), usually just before or during dinner. Children have to wait for the ringing of a Christmas bell (one of the decorations on the Christmas tree) \u2013 the sign that ''Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek/Je\u017ei\u0161ko'' (little Jesus) has just passed by \u2013 to run for the presents. That happens at the end of their Christmas dinner. There is a rich tradition of hard baked Christmas sweets (''Cukrov\u00ed/viano\u010dn\u00e9 kol\u00e1\u010de'').\n\nOther Czech and Slovak Christmas traditions involve predictions for the future. Apples are always cut crosswise: if a perfect star appears in the core, the next year will be successful, distorted star means a bad year or illness, while a cross may suggest death. Girls throw shoes over their shoulders \u2013 if the toe points to the door, the girl will get married soon. Another tradition requires pouring some molten lead into water and guessing a message from its shapes.\n\nIn Catholic Slovakia, the tradition of [[Jasli\u010dk\u00e1ri]] involves young men dressed as shepherds or angels visiting their neighbors and presenting recitations and songs about the story of the birth of Jesus.<ref name=\"Ball2003\">{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Ann|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjI9YQBFDGYC&pg=PA271|accessdate=November 20, 2015|year=2003|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|isbn=9780879739102|pages=271\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===== Hungary =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Hungary}}\nThe Christmas and gift-giving season starts relatively early compared to other cultures, with the Santa-like figure, or Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, [[Mikul\u00e1s|Mikul\u00e1s (or Szent Mikl\u00f3s)]] traditionally visiting the homes of Hungarian children on the night of December 5, on the eve of Saint Nicholas Feast Day, December 6.\n\nAlthough the role of gift-giver on Christmas Day itself is assigned to the Christ Child, on the night before St. Nicholas Day Hungarian children traditionally place a boot on their windowsill waiting for Mikul\u00e1s to come by and fill it with treats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/hungary/ |title=St. Nicholas Around the World: Hungary |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}</ref> In Hungary, celebrations begin with Christmas tree decoration and gift packaging during daytime on December 24, then comes a family dinner with traditional Christmas meals.

The day is otherwise a fast-day.\n\n[[File:Budapest-Baumkuchen 6361.jpg|thumb|left|[[K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs]] in Budapest]]\n\nIn the evening (Christmas Eve, in Hungarian: Szenteste) the Angel or the Little (Baby) Jesus (Hungarian: Kisj\u00e9zus or J\u00e9zuska) delivers the presents. This is the most intimate moment of Christmas, featuring warmly lit Christmas tree and candles, soft Christmas music, family singing of Christmas or religious songs and gift pack openings. There is also a popular folk custom during December and especially on Christmas Eve, in which children or adults present the birth of Jesus. The custom is called 'playing Bethlehem' (Hungarian: Betlehemez\u00e9s), and it is an acting performance, where the 'actors' are wearing costumes, and telling stories about the three kings, the shepherds, Mary, Joseph and of course the birth of the Holy Child. A Christmas crib and a church are used as the scene. The actors go from house to house, and they receive gifts for their performance.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===== Poland =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Poland}}\n\n[[File:Wigilia potrawy 554.jpg|thumb|Traditional Polish ''[[Wigilia]]'' meal]]\n[[File:Oplatki.w.koszyczku.jpg|thumb|Polish [[Op\u0142atki]] (Christmas Wafer) in a basket]]\n[[File:Kol\u0119dnicy 2008.JPG|thumb|Carollers walk from house to house receiving treats along the way]]\n\nIn the largely Roman Catholic Poland, Christmas Eve begins with a day of fasting and then a night of feasting. The traditional Christmas meal is known as [[Wigilia]] (\"The [[Vigil]]\"), and being invited to attend a Wigilia dinner with a family is considered a high honour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/poland.htm |title=Christmas traditions in Poland |publisher=Thehistoryofchristmas.com |accessdate=December 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207072601/http://thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/poland.htm |archive-date=December 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nOn the night of Christmas Eve, the appearance of the first star in the sky is watched for, in remembrance of the [[Star of Bethlehem]], that it has been given an affectionate name of \"the little star\" or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, \"The star has come!\" After the first star appearance is declared, the family members sit down to a dinner table.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\" />\n\nAccording to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a [[manger]]. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. The dinner contains twelve dishes, one for each Apostle. In many homes, an extra place setting is set. The empty setting is symbolically left at the table for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, an angel, the [[Baby Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit should appear to share the feast.\n\nBefore eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other. The supper begins with the breaking of the [[op\u0142atek]]. By sharing a piece of [[Christmas wafer]] (''Op\u0142atki''), when everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. The op\u0142atek is usually blessed by the presiding Bishop, and stamped with a religious image, such as the nativity scene, they then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table.\n\nA traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[barszcz]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (translated as \"little ears\", also known as meatless ravioli). The most common dishes are fish soup, with potato salad, [[pierogi]], [[go\u0142\u0105bki]] filled with [[kasza]], pickled [[herring]] and fruit [[kompot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/poland.shtml |title=Christmas in Poland |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>\nCarp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, herring fillets, herring in [[aspic]] and for dessert, [[makowiec (pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink. etc. Dishes beside fish are usually [[cabbage]]-, forest mushroom- (like [[boletus]]) and [[poppyseed]]-based, with herring being very important. After supper the Star Man arrives attended by the Star Boys. They are dressed as Wise Men or animals or other figures. The Star Man examines the children in their catechism and rewards them with small presents if they do well, even if they need a bit of coaching. The Star Boys sing carols and are given a treat for their help. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star. The meal is followed by the exchange of gifts.\nThe remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that \"The Little Star\" brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.\n\nChristmas Eve ends with [[Pasterka]], the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |title=Bo\u017ce Narodzenie i polskie tradycje |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2008 }}</ref> The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses.

Celebrations begin with the decoration of the Christmas tree during daytime on December 24, and in the evening (Christmas Eve, in Romanian: Ajunul Cr\u0103ciunului) ''Mo\u015f Cr\u0103ciun'' (Father Christmas) delivers the presents.\n\nThe singing of carols is a very important part of Romanian Christmas festivities. On the first day of Christmas, many carolers walk through the streets of the towns and villages, holding a star made of cardboard and paper on which are depicted various scenes from the Bible. Romanian tradition has the smallest children going from house to house, singing carols and reciting poems and legends during the whole Christmas season. The leader of the group carries with him a star made of wood, covered with metal foil and decorated with bells and coloured ribbons. An image of the Nativity is painted on the star's centre, and this piece of handiwork is attached to the end of a broom or other long stick.\n\nRomanian food served during the holidays is a hearty multi-coursed meal, most of which consists of pork (organs, muscle, and fat). This is mainly a symbolic gesture for [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/recurs-la-romania/ignat-sarbatoare-insangerata-112680.html Ignat, s\u0103rb\u0103toare ins\u0103ngerat\u0103], December 22, 2007</ref>\n\n==== Eastern Europe ====\n\nSince the 1880s, the Christmas customs of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] countries have included a similar character known as ''[[Ded Moroz]]'' (\"Grandfather Frost\"). According to legend, he travels in a magical ''sanki'' \u2014 a decorated [[sleigh]] drawn by reindeer (or three white horses). With his young, blonde assistant ''[[Snegurochka]]'' (the \"Snow Maiden\", said to be his granddaughter) at his side, he visits homes and gives gifts to good children (not true for former Yugoslavian countries). He only delivers presents to children while they are asleep, and unlike Santa, he does not travel down chimneys, coming instead to the front door of children's homes. However, in Russia, children receive presents on [[New Year's Day]], Christmas is solely celebrated by Christians and on January 7.\n\nThis Ded Moroz (in Russia, ''Ded Moroz'') is not identified nor in any way associated with [[Saint Nicholas of Myra]] ([[feast day]], December 6), who is very widely revered in Eastern Europe for his clerical and charitable works as a bishop. In all likelihood, Ded Moroz is actually in Slavic tradition like Santa Claus, any connection to the original saint having long since disappeared.\n\n===== Georgia =====\n\n[[File:Alilo 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Children at the Alilo march in the streets of [[Tbilisi]]]]\n\nOn [[Public holidays in Georgia|calendars in Georgia]], Christmas ({{lang-ka|\u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0}}, ''shoba'') is celebrated on January 7 (December 25 on the Julian calendar). It is traditional in Georgia to go on [[Alilo]] (a modified pronunciation of Alleluia), a mass walk in the streets, dressed in special clothing to celebrate and congratulate each other. Most members of the Alilo march are children and they are given sweets by the adults. The Alilo carols vary across the [[mkhare|provinces]] of Georgia. In most songs these words are used: \"\u10dd\u10ea\u10d3\u10d0\u10ee\u10e3\u10d7\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d4\u10d9\u10d4\u10db\u10d1\u10d4\u10e0\u10e1\u10d0, \u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4 \u10d8\u10e8\u10d5\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d4\u10d7\u10da\u10d4\u10db\u10e1\u10d0\u10dd'\" (''otsdakhutsa dekembersa qriste ishva betlemsao'') \u2013 \"on 25th December Christ was born in Bethlehem\". A local variant of the Christmas tree, called [[Chichilaki]], is made of soft wooden material with curled branches. Sometimes it is hazelnut branch which is carved into a [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]-like shape and decorated with fruits and sweets. The Western custom of a Christmas tree (''nadzvis khe'') is also popular and has been imported through Russia. The Georgian equivalent of \"Santa Claus\" is known as ''tovlis papa'' (or ''tovlis babua'' in western [[Georgian dialects]]), literally meaning a \"Grandfather snow\", and is traditionally portrayed with long white beard, dressed in national costume \"[[chokha]]\" and wearing a fur cloak \"nabadi\".\n\n===== Russia =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Russia}}\n\n[[File:Place pres de la gare Moscou.jpg|thumb|New Year decorations in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]]]\n\nAs in some other Eastern Orthodox countries, and due to the 13-day difference between the newer Gregorian Calender and the older Julian Calendars, Christmas is celebrated on January 7. Unlike its Western counterparts, Christmas is mainly a religious event in Russia. On Christmas Eve (January 6), there are several long services, including the [[Royal Hours]] and Vespers combined with the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve \"[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Holy Supper]]\", which consists of 12 dishes, one to honor each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the \"\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f\" [[All Night Vigil]]. Then again, on Christmas Morning, for the \"\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\u044f\" Divine Liturgy of the Nativity. Since 1992 Christmas has become a [[Public holidays in Russia|national holiday in Russia]], as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the officially atheist state. Christmas tree and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, the Christmas tradition was adopted as part of the secular [[New Year's Eve#Russia|New Year]] celebration. These include the decoration of a tree, or \"\u0451\u043b\u043a\u0430\" (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving \"Ded Moroz\" (\u0414\u0435\u0434 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 \"[[Grandfather Frost]]\") and his granddaughter, \"Snegurochka\" (\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \"[[The Snowmaiden]]\"). Many of these were brought to Russia by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] after his Western travels in the late 17th century. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===== Ukraine =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Ukraine}}\n\n[[File:Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper.jpg|thumb|right|Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, Ukraine]]\n\n''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' or \"Holy Supper\" is the central tradition of the Christmas Eve celebrations in Ukrainian homes and takes place in most parts of the country on January 6. In Western Ukraine, especially in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], due to historical multi-culturism, Christmas can be observed twice\u2014on December 25 and January 7, often irrespective of whether the family belongs to [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], the (Roman) Catholic Church, one of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (disambiguation)|Ukrainian Orthodox Churches]], or one of the Protestant denominations. The Western Ukrainian tradition of two Christmas celebrations, since 2017, are also celebrated nationwide as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/ukraine-seeks-distance-from-moscow-with-new-christmas-holiday/article/507753|title=Ukraine seeks distance from Moscow with new Christmas holiday|website=m.digitaljournal.com|access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|uk}} {{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-42008437|title=\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 25 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c|date=November 16, 2017|work=BBC \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430|access-date=November 16, 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nWhen the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, which symbolizes the trek of the Three Wise Men, the Sviata Vechera may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the didukh which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. Didukh means literally \"grandfather spirit\" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table. The dinner table sometimes has a few wisps of hay on the embroidered table cloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. A prayer is said and the father says the traditional Christmas greeting, \"Chrystos rodyvsya!\" which is translated to \"Christ is born!\", which is answered by the family with \"Slavite Yoho!\" which means \"Let us glorify him!\". In some families the Old Slavic form \"\u0421hrystos rozhdayetsya!\" is used. At the end of the Sviata Vechera the family often sings Ukrainian Christmas Carols. In many communities the old Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations.\n\nTraditionally, Christmas Day opens for Ukrainian families with attendance in church services (Mass, worship service or Divine Liturgy). Ukrainian churches offer services starting before midnight on Christmas Eve and on Christmas morning. Christmas supper, without Lenten restrictions, does not have as many traditions connected with it as Sviata Vechera. The old tradition in Ukraine of giving gifts to children on St. Nicholas Day, December 19, has generally been replaced by the Christmas date and it is the Father Frost who visits all the children in a sleigh pulled by only three reindeer. (In Western Ukraine the St. Nicholas Day is marked there on December 6.)\n\n==== Northern Europe ====\n{{Essay-like|section|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn much of Northern Europe Christmas is celebrated on December 24 and is referred to as ''Jul'' (see [[Yule]]), while December 25 is a relaxed day for visiting relatives. \"Yule\" may come from the Norse word hweol, j\u00f3l, meaning wheel, and [[Old English]] [[g\u00e9ol]]. The Norse believed that the sun was a great wheel of fire that rolled towards and then away from the earth.\n\n===== Denmark =====\n{{Main|Jul (Denmark)}}\n\n[[File:Julemiddag.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Traditional [[Danish people|Danish]] Christmas dinner]]\n\nDanes celebrate on December 24, which is referred to as ''Juleaften'' (literally \"Yule evening\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/denmark.htm|title=Traditions in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915005111/http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/denmark.htm|archive-date=September 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> An evening meal with the family consists of either roast pork, roast duck or roast goose and eaten with potatoes, plenty of gravy, and red cabbage or finely chopped kale boiled in butter. Also caramelized potatoes is an important part of the Dane's Christmas dinner. For dessert rice pudding is traditionally served \u2013 composed largely of whipped cream and accompanied by lashings of black cherry sauce. The rice pudding also contains chopped peeled almonds, and a single whole peeled almond. Whoever finds the whole almond will have good luck for the coming year, and the lucky finder is entitled to a small gift, ''Mandelgave''.\nAfter the meal is complete, the family gathers around the Christmas tree and sings Christmas songs and hymns while holding hands and dancing in circles, and may even tour the house, still holding hands and singing. When the singing is complete, traditions vary. In some traditions, the family will select one child to hand out the presents. All children take turns handing out presents in other traditions.\nAlternatively \"Santa Claus\", the [[Julemanden]], will appear at the door in full costume with a large sack of presents over his shoulder. He will then distribute the presents, with the assistance of any children present, to their recipients. He should be offered suitable drink to keep him warm and cheerful on his onward journey, but do not expect loquacity \u2013 utterances are normally limited to loud and hearty laughs. Meanwhile, the presents are opened and this is followed by more snacks, candy, chips and, sometimes, a traditional Christmas drink called ''[[Gl\u00f8gg]].''\n\nThe Danish are somewhat famous for their ''Julefrokost,'' literally meaning \"Christmas lunch\", which includes various traditional Danish dishes, potentially accompanied by beer and [[Snaps]]. These Julefrokoster are popular and held within families, as well as by companies and other social groups. They would traditionally have taken place leading up to Christmas, but due to time constraints and stress during the Christmas month they are nowadays commonly held during November and January as well. The family Julefrokoster however are normally held on Christmas Day and/or The Second day of Christmas (December 26).\n\n[[File:Adventkalender andrea.JPG|thumb|[[Advent calendar]]]]\n\nAnother more recent Danish tradition is the concept of television ''Julekalendere'', special Christmas-themed, advent calendar-type television programmes with a daily episode shown on each of the first 24&nbsp;days of December, thus culminating on ''Juleaften''. Several television stations produce their own, most, but not all of which are targeted at child viewers. Some of the television advent calendars become extremely popular and go on to be reprised in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/denmark.shtml|title=Christmas in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Denmark, Santa Claus is known as [[Julemanden]] (literally \"the Yule Man\") and is said to arrive in a sleigh drawn by reindeer, with presents for the children. He is assisted with his Yuletide chores by elves known as julenisser (or simply nisser), who are traditionally believed to live in attics, barns or similar places. In some traditions, to maintain the favour and protection of these nisser, children leave out saucers of milk or rice pudding or other treats for them and are delighted to find the food gone on Christmas morning.\n\n===== Estonia =====\n\n[[File:J\u00f5uluvanade XIII konverents.IMG 6103 by Ave Maria M\u00f5istlik.JPG|thumb|left|Christmas Santas]]\n\nIn the weeks preceding Christmas or ''j\u00f5ulud'', children place a slipper in their windows and receive a piece of candy or some other sweets from visiting elves (''p\u00e4kapikud''). Estonians celebrate Christmas on December 24, which is referred to as ''j\u00f5ululaup\u00e4ev'' (\"Christmas Saturday\"){{clarify|reason=Of course this day does not always fall on a Saturday|date=January 2011}} and is by act of Parliament a [[Public holidays in Estonia|public holiday in Estonia]]. Each year on this day, the President of Estonia declares the Christmas Peace and attends a Christmas service. The tradition was initiated by the order of [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] of Sweden in the 17th century. Estonian children are visited by ''[[j\u00f5uluvana]]'' (\"Santa Claus\") on Christmas Eve, and must sing songs or recite Christmas poems before receiving their gifts.\n\nThe evening meal typically includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut with pork and barley (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes, white and blood sausage, potato salad with red beet, and p\u00e2t\u00e9. For dessert, Estonians eat gingerbread (''piparkoogid'') and marzipan. The most highly regarded drinks during this time have been beer and mulled wine or ''[[gl\u00f6gi]]'' and ''h\u00f5\u00f5gvein'' (\"glowing wine\"). Estonians leave the leftover food from Christmas dinner on the table overnight, in hopes that the spirits of family, friends, and loved ones will visit and also have something to eat. It is also customary to visit graveyards and leave candles for the deceased.\n\nDecember 25 or ''j\u00f5ulup\u00fcha'' is a relaxed day for visiting relatives.\n\n===== Finland =====\n{{main|Christmas in Finland}}\n[[File:Christmas presents and a tree.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas presents and a tree in Finland]]\n[[File:Joulukinkku.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas ham]]\n\nChristmas is an extensively prepared celebration centering on the family and home, although it has a religious dimension also. The Christmas season starts from December or even in late November, when shops began advertising potential Christmas gifts. Christmas decorations and songs become more prominent as Christmas nears, and children count days to Christmas with [[Advent calendar]]s. Schools and some other places have the day before Christmas Eve (''aatonaatto'', December 23) as a holiday, but at the latest on the Christmas Eve (''jouluaatto'', December 24), shops close early and stay closed until December 26. The main Christmas festivities are held on Christmas Eve on December 24, while Christmas Day (''joulup\u00e4iv\u00e4'') and the following day (''Tapaninp\u00e4iv\u00e4'', \"St. Stephen's Day\") are mandatory [[public holidays in Finland]]<ref name=\"Christmas in Finland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/finland.shtml|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Schools continue holidays up to the New Year.\n\nThe Declaration of [[Christmas Peace]] has been a tradition in Finland from [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] every year, except in 1939 due to the [[Winter War]]. It is a custom in many towns and cities. The most famous one of these declarations is on the Old Great Square of [[Turku]], the former capital of Finland, at noon on Christmas Eve. It is broadcast on Finnish radio (since 1935) and television, and nowadays also in some foreign countries. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn ''Jumala ompi linnamme'' ([[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]'') by a band of the [[Finnish Navy]] and a male choir and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll, in both Finnish and Swedish, the country's two official languages:\n\n: Tomorrow, God willing, is the most gracious feast of the birth of our Lord and Saviour, and therefore a general Christmas peace is hereby declared, and all persons are directed to observe this holiday with due reverence and otherwise quietly and peacefully to conduct themselves, for whosoever breaks this peace and disturbs the Christmas holiday by any unlawful or improper conduct shall be liable, under aggravating circumstances, to whatever penalty is prescribed by law and decree for each particular offence or misdemeanour. Finally, all citizens are wished a joyous Christmas holiday.\n\nThe ceremony ends with trumpets playing the Finnish [[national anthem]] ''[[Maamme]]'' and ''[[Bj\u00f6rneborgarnas marsch|Porilaisten marssi]]'', with the crowd usually singing when the band plays ''Maamme''. Recently, there is also a declaration of Christmas peace for forest animals in many cities and municipalities, so there is no hunting during Christmas.\n\n[[File:Hundreds of candles and a Christian Cross at a cemetery on Christmas eve.jpg|thumb|It is traditional in Finland to bring candles to the graves of loved ones on Christmas Eve and [[All Saints Day]].]]\n\nFinnish people clean their homes well before Christmas and prepare special treats for the festive season. A sheaf of grain, nuts and seeds are tied on a pole, which is placed in the garden for the birds to feed on. Spruce trees are cut or bought from a market and taken to homes on or a few days before Christmas Eve and are decorated. Candles are lit on the Christmas tree, which is traditionally decorated using apples and other fruit, candies, paper flags, cotton and tinsel, in addition to [[Christmas ornaments]] such as stars or baubles. Actual candles are no longer used, being replaced by incandescent or LED lamps. A star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem is placed at the top of the tree. Just before the Christmas festivities begin, people usually take a Christmas [[sauna]]. The tradition is very old; unlike on normal days, when one would go to the sauna in the evening, on Christmas Eve it is done before sunset. This tradition is based on a pre-20th century belief that the spirits of the dead return and have a sauna at the usual sauna hours.<ref name=\"Christmas in Finland\"/>\n\nAfterwards, they dress up in clean clothes for the Christmas dinner or [[joulup\u00f6yt\u00e4]], which is usually served between 5pm and 7pm, or traditionally with the appearance of the first star in the sky. The most traditional dish of the Finnish Christmas dinner is probably [[Christmas Ham]], roast suckling pig or a roasted fresh ham, but some may prefer alternatives like turkey. Several sorts of [[casserole]]s, like rutabaga, carrot and potato casserole are traditional, and are almost always exclusively served on Christmas. Other traditional Christmas dishes include [[lutefisk|boiled codfish]] (soaked beforehand in a lye solution for a week to soften it) served snowy white and fluffy, pickled [[herring]] and vegetables. Prune jam pastries, plum or mixed fruit soup, rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk, and sweets like chocolate are popular desserts. Christmas gifts are usually exchanged after Christmas Eve dinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=180237&contentlan=2&culture=en-US|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Children do not hang up stockings in Finland but ''[[Joulupukki]]'' visits the household, maybe with a ''[[tonttu]]'' to help him distribute the presents.\n\nChristmas Day services begin early at six in the morning and people visit families and reunions are arranged on this day.\n\nBoxing Day, or ''tapaninp\u00e4iv\u00e4'' ([[St. Stephen]]'s Day) is traditionally set aside for driving around the village (''tapaninajot''), to counterbalance the solemn and family-oriented part of Christmas.\n\n===== Iceland =====\n{{Main|J\u00f3l (Iceland)}}\n\nThe Christmas or [[Yule]] ([[J\u00f3l (Iceland)|J\u00f3l]] in Icelandic)<ref name=\"Christmas in Iceland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/iceland.shtml|title=Christmas in Iceland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> celebration in Iceland starts four Sundays before Christmas proper, which begins on December 24 (Advent) and ends thirteen days later on January 6. Traditionally, one candle is lit each Sunday until four candles are lit on the 24th. At 6:00&nbsp;pm [[Church bell]]s ring to start the Christmas celebration. The religiously observant and/or traditional Icelanders will attend mass at this time while the secular Icelanders will begin their holiday meal immediately. After the meal is finished, they open gifts and spend the evening together. In Iceland people over the [[Icelandic cuisine#Christmas dishes|Yule holidays most often eat]] smoked lamb, ptarmigan and turkey. Pork is also very popular.\n\nThirteen days before December 24 the [[Yule Lads]] children will leave their shoes by the window so that the Yule Lads can leave small gifts in their shoes.<ref name=\"Christmas in Iceland\"/> The Yule Lads are the sons of two trolls living in the Icelandic mountains. Each of the Yule Lads is known for a different kind of mischief (for example slamming doors, stealing meat, stealing milk or eating the candles). The Yule Lads traditionally wear early Icelandic wool clothing but are now known for the more recognizable red and white suit.\n\nEach home typically sets up a Christmas tree indoors in the living room with most decorating it on December 11. In addition to the decorations, presents are put underneath the tree. It is also a tradition in many homes to boil skate on the 23rd. The day is called Saint Thorlak Mass (\u00deorl\u00e1ksmessa).\n\nDuring the holiday season, it is traditional for families to work together to bake small cookies to serve or give to guests. Most common are thin gingerbread cookies which are decorated in many different colors of glaze. Many families also follow the tradition of making Laufabrau\u00f0 (Leafbread), which is a flat thin bread that is cut out using a special tool and folding technique.\n\nThe end of year is divided between two days \u2013 the Old Year's Day (Gaml\u00e1rsdagur) and the New Year's Day (N\u00fd\u00e1rsdagur). At the night of the former and morning of the latter Icelanders shoot up fireworks blowing the old year away and welcoming the new one.\n\nThirteen days after the 24th Icelanders say goodbye to the Yule Lads and other mystical creatures such as elves and trolls. There are bonfires held throughout the country while the elves, Yule Lads, and Icelanders dance together before saying goodbye until the next Christmas.<ref name=\"Christmas in Iceland\"/>\n\n===== Norway =====\n{{Main|Jul (Norway)}}\n\n[[File:Juletr\u00e6slys.jpg|thumb|[[Christmas tree]] with a [[candle]]]]\n\n[[File:Gifts xmas.jpg|thumb|Christmas [[gifts]]]]\n\nThe major day of celebration in Norway, as in most of Northern Europe, is December 24. Although it is legally a regular workday until 16:00,<ref name=\"Christmas in Norway\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/norway.shtml|title=Christmas in Norway|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> most stores close early. Church bells chime in the Christmas holiday between 17:00 and 18:00. In some families, the Christmas story from Luke 2 will be read from the old family Bible. The main Christmas meal is served in the evening. Common main dishes include pork rib, \"[[pinnekj\u00f8tt]]\" (pieces of lamb rib steamed on a grid of birch wood). Many people also eat \"[[lutefisk]]\" or fresh, poached cod. Rice porridge is also popular (but most commonly served as an early lunch rather than for the main Christmas dinner), an almond is often hidden in the porridge, and the person who finds it wins a treat or small gift. In some parts of Norway it is common to place porridge outside (in a barn, outhouse or even in the forest) to please \"Nissen\". In many families, where the parents grew up with different traditions, two different main dishes are served to please everyone. If children are present (and they have behaved well the last year), \"Julenissen\" (Santa Claus) pays a visit, otherwise gifts are stored under the Christmas tree.<ref name=\"Christmas in Norway\"/>\n\nFor a lot of Norwegians, especially families, television is an important part of the earlier hours of Christmas Eve. Many Norwegians do not feel the Christmas spirit until they have watched the Czech-German fairy tale ''[[T\u0159i o\u0159\u00ed\u0161ky pro Popelku|Three Nuts for Cinderella]]'' (Norwegian title: ''Tre n\u00f8tter til Askepott''), the Disney Christmas cavalcade ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-disney.html|title=Christmas in Norway fairytale|author=TVparty|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> the Norwegian fairytale movie ''Reisen til Julestjernen'' or the comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]''. Attending one of the many stage productions of ''[[Putti Plutti Pott and Santa's Beard]]'' is also a very popular tradition.\n\nDecember 25 is a very quiet and relaxed day. Church services are well attended. The old tradition of a very early morning service before breakfast has been replaced in most areas by a service in the later morning. Afterward, many families get together for a large festive meal.<ref name=\"Christmas in Norway\"/>\n\nDecember 26 is also a day of many festivities. Cinemas, night clubs and bars are full, and there are lots of private gatherings and parties, where all kinds of traditional [[Christmas cookies]] and sweets are enjoyed. Fatty, tasty dinners are also part of it. The time between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve is called [[:wikt:romjul|romjul]]. During this time children in some parts of Norway dress up as \"nisser\" and \"Julebukk\" \u2013 \"Christmas goat\" \u2013 in their neighbourhoods and sing Christmas carols to receive treats, much the same way as in the American [[Halloween]]. January 6 (the 13th day of Christmas) is commonly regarded as the end of Christmas, while some end Christmas on the 20th day, and some even at Candlemas.\n\n===== Sweden =====\n{{Main|Jul (Sweden)}}\n\n[[File:Privat julbord.JPG|thumb|Traditional [[julbord]], or Christmas table]]\n[[File:Lucia-13.12.06.jpg|thumb|Saint Lucy's Day 2006]]\n[[File:Stortorgsbrunnen 2009.jpg|thumb|Christmas market with Christmas tree in [[Stockholm]]]]\n[[File:Christmas-Goat.JPG|thumb|Julbock, a giant Christmas goat at the [[G\u00e4vle]] town market, Sweden]]\n\nThe pre-Christian holiday of [[Yule]], or ''j\u00f3l'', was the most important holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe.<ref name=\"Christmas in Sweden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/sweden.shtml|title=Christmas in Sweden|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Originally the observance of the [[winter solstice]], and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the [[Advent]] and [[Christmas]] celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark. Swedish Christmas celebrations begin with the first of [[Advent]]. [[Saint Lucy's Day]] (locally known as ''Luciadagen'') is the first major Christmas celebration before Christmas itself. The eldest daughter arising early and wearing her Lucy garb of white robe, red sash, and a wire crown covered with whortleberry-twigs with nine lighted candles fastened in it awakens the family, singing \"Santa Lucia\", serving them coffee and [[saffron bun]]s ([[St. Lucia buns]]), thus ushering in the Christmas season.<ref name=Matthews>{{cite web|url=http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|title=Matthews, Jeff. \"Everybody Loves Lucy\", University of Maryland University College \u2013 Italian Studies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152016/http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|archivedate=September 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSchools elect students to play the part of Lucia and her maids, and a national Lucia is elected on national television from regional winners. The regional Lucias will visit shopping malls, old people's homes and churches, singing and handing out ''pepparkakor'' [[gingerbread]] cookies.\n\nBoys take part in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called ''stj\u00e4rngossar'' (star boys); some may be dressed up as \"[[tomte]]nissar\", carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as [[gingerbread man|gingerbread men]]. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually ''Staffan Stalledr\u00e4ng'', which tells the story about [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]], caring for his five horses.\nElectric candles and glowing stars are placed in almost every window in the month of December in Sweden. Although December 25 (''juldagen'') is a [[Public holidays in Sweden|Swedish public holiday]], December 24 is the day when Santa Claus ''Jultomte'' (or simply ''[[Tomte]]'') brings the presents. Although not a public holiday, Christmas Eve is a ''de facto'' holiday in the sense that most workplaces are closed, and those who work, for instance in shops or care homes, get extra wages as a compensation. (''See also: [[Public holidays in Sweden]] for further explanation of this concept.'')\n\nThe Jultomte was originally a small invisible Christmas house gnome or dwarf from the Nordic mythology, who watched over the house and its inhabitants. An old superstition still calls for feeding the Tomte on Christmas Eve with a small bowl of porridge. If a bowl of porridge is not laid out for him somewhere in or outside the house, he will bring bad luck to everyone in the house the next year. The modern \"Tomten\", nowadays is a version of Santa Claus in red cloth and white beard, except that he doesn't enter the house through the chimney, but knocks on the door and asks \"finns det n\u00e5gra sn\u00e4lla barn h\u00e4r?\" (\"are there any nice children here?\")\n\nChristmas is, as everywhere else, an occasion celebrated with food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm|title=Traditions in Sweden|accessdate=September 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627150923/http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm|archive-date=June 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Almost all Swedish families celebrate on December 24 with a Christmas table, called Christmas [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]] (''[[julbord]]''), a display of several Christmas food items. Almost all julbord has Christmas ham, (''[[julskinka]]'') accompanied by other Christmas dishes, such as small [[wikt:meatball|meatball]]s, [[pickled herring]], [[spareribs]], small hot dogs, [[lutfisk]], pork sausage, salmon, [[Janssons frestelse]] (potato casserole with anchovy), and [[rice pudding]]. The Christmas julbord is served with [[julmust]] and beverage like mulled wine, Christmas beer or [[snaps]]. A Scandinavian speciality is the ''[[glogg|gl\u00f6gg]]'' (mulled and spiced wine with almonds and raisins), which is served hot in small cups. The different dishes of the julbord may vary throughout Sweden, from South to North. Businesses traditionally invite their employees to a julbord dinner or lunch the weeks before Christmas, and people go out privately to restaurants which also customarily offer julbord during December.\n\nExamples of candies and treats associated with Christmas are [[marzipan]], toffee, [[kn\u00e4ck]] (quite similar to butterscotch), nuts and fruits: figs, chocolate, dates and oranges decorated with cloves.\n\nTelevision also plays a big role, many families watch the Disney Christmas special ''Kalle Anka och hans v\u00e4nner \u00f6nskar God Jul''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> (''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton]]'' (animated short), or a re-run of the ''[[Svensson, Svensson]]'' episode ''God Jul!''

If one has two families to celebrate Christmas with, it is common that one of the families move their celebrations to Christmas Day or the day before Christmas Eve (commonly referred to as ''little Christmas Eve'').\n\nAfter December 24, the Christmas celebrations have more or less come to an end. Some people attend the [[julottan]], an early morning church service on December 25. This particular service was the main service of Christmas historically\u2014nowadays, the [[Midnight Mass]] has become increasingly popular. Others attend a simpler service called ''Christmas Prayer'' in the afternoon of Christmas Eve; however, many Swedes do not attend church at all during Christmas as the country is very [[secular]]. Even so, most families do set up a ''Julkrubba'' (''[[Nativity scene|Christmas Crib]]'').

The festivities begin on [[Saint Nicholas]]'s Day on December 6 (in Slovenia) or [[St. Lucy]]'s on December 13 depending on what region (in Croatia). St. Lucy or St. Nicholas brings children presents, and St. Nicholas is said to be accompanied by [[Krampus]] who steals away the presents of bad children. This \"anti-Santa\" is said to have one cloven hoof, a handful of heavy chains, and a sack on his back to collect naughty children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardstore.com/christmas-around-the-world |title=How is Christmas Celebrated Around the World |work=CardStore.com |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref> In Croatia on St. Lucy's, families will plant wheat seeds in a bowl of shallow water, which will grow several inches by Christmas and are then tied together with a red, blue and white ribbon called ''trobojnica'.\n\nOn Christmas Eve (Croatian: ''Badnjak'', Slovene: ''Sveti ve\u010der'' (holy eve)), three candles representing the [[Trinity]] are lit and placed in the middle of the wheat, the glow symbolizes the soul of each person. On this day, the tree is decorated, the home is decked with greenery and the women already beginning to prepare the Christmas meal. They also bake special types of bread: one is round inscribed with a cross on top known as the ''cesnica'', another is made with honey, nuts and dried fruit called the Christmas Eve Bread (Croatian: ''Badnji Kruh'', Slovene: ''Bo\u017ei\u010dni kruh''). In many villages, straw (which symbolizes Christ's birth in the manger) is spread around the floors of the home for the Christmas Eve dinner. As is customary with Catholic people, meat is not consumed in Croatia, while in Slovenia it is. Instead of meat in Croatia and with other food in Slovenia, salad and fish is served, many choosing to eat the [[Dalmatia]]n specialty ''bakalar'', dried cod fish. The family then sprinkle holy water on their [[Yule log]] (''badnjak'') which they light and watch. In villages, the badnjak is freshly cut that very morning by the father of the household while reciting traditional prayers. At the end of the meal, a piece of the ''cesnica'' is cut and dipped in wine and used to sprinkle on the candles to extinguish them, while reciting the [[Trinitarian formula]] (\"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen\").\n\nMany families will go to a midnight mass on Christmas Eve and often another on Christmas Day. It is common for Christmas presents to be placed under the tree, to suggest that the Angel or the Baby Jesus (''Mali Isus'') leaves them there while others are attending midnight mass. Presents are opened after the mass. Christmas is a day of celebrating with family; a large feast is prepared and traditional foods such as stuffed cabbage, turkey, pot roast, pita and smoked meat are served, along with various desserts such as [[fritule]], [[potica]] (especially in Slovenia), [[strudel]], and cookies.\n\nSlovenes are also visited by another one of their ''trije dobri mo\u017eje'' (three good guys), who bring presents in December: Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus and Dedek Mraz (\"Grandfather Frost\"). Families mostly celebrate New Year's Eve at home with extended family members, friends, and sometimes neighbours. Women prepare [[sarma (food)|cabbage sarma]], which they will eat on January 1 to symbolize good fortune, and [[steak tartare]], which they eat on New Year's Eve on toast with butter. At midnight, people go outdoors to watch fireworks, while Dedek Mraz leaves presents under the tree. Epiphany on January 6 marks the end of the Christmas season.\n\n===== Bulgaria =====\n\n[[File:Sofia TZUM night.JPG|thumb|left|TZUM department store at Christmastime, [[Sofia]], Bulgaria]]\n\nIn Bulgaria, Christmas ({{lang-bg|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430}}, ''[[Koleda]]'' or more formally \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e, ''Rozhdestvo Hristovo'', \"Nativity of Jesus\") is celebrated on December 25 and is preceded by Christmas Eve (\u0411\u044a\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440, ''Badni vecher''). Traditionally, Christmas Eve would be the climax of the [[Nativity Fast]], and thus only an odd number of lenten dishes are presented on that evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/bulgarianchristmas.htm|title=Bulgarian Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> The table is usually not cleared after the dinner and until the next morning, to leave some food for the holy spirits \u2013 a custom which probably comes from pagan pre-Christian times. On that day, a [[Bulgarian budnik]] is set alight.

Another custom is the baking of a traditional round loaf (\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430, ''[[pita]]''). The pita is broken into pieces by the head of the family and a piece is given to each family member, a valuable possession, and a piece for God. A coin is hidden inside the pita and whoever gets the coin, he or she will have luck, health, and prosperity in the coming year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indobase.com/holidays/christmas/world/christmas-in-bulgaria.html|title=Christmas in bulgaria|publisher=Indobase|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nAs in other countries, a Christmas tree is typically set up and the entire house is decorated.

Most families set up Christmas trees and shops have decorations and lights. Presents are placed under the Christmas tree and are opened on January 1, St Basil's Day. In Greek tradition, [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil's (of Caesarea)]] name was given to Father Christmas and is supposed to visit children and give presents on January 1 (when Basil's memory is celebrated), unlike other European traditions, where this person is Saint Nicholas and comes every Christmas. Carol singing is another tradition on Christmas and New Year's Eve. The Christmas meal usually includes lamb or pork and desserts such as [[kourabies]] (\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2) and [[melomakarona]] (\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1).

Christmas morning after church there is the practice to become the \"pork batches,\" served with wine to open the appetite, and \"thick,\" done by Eve, which is boiled pork with plenty of lemon that is left to clot overnight. The pork-food is in the hallmark of Greek Christmas. In many Greek cities and ports like [[Thessaloniki]], [[Volos]], [[Patras|Patra]], the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek Islands]] etc., it is decorated the traditional Christmas boat. And in many central squares of the country a big Christmas tree, where  many of the Christmas festivals take place.\n\nSome of the Christmas Festivals in Greece are \"\u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\" ''Rugatsari\u03b1'', where all the residents of the city of [[Kastoria]] are delivered in a separate [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] revelry, with the accompaniment of folk melodies bodies all traditional musical sounds of the area. This ancient habit, whose origin is lost in time.\nIn [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] there are beliefs about demonic and other supernatural beings, who come from the Twelve Days of Christ as the Epiphany.

At that time, she brought a flotilla of grain-bearing ships to starving Sicily, whose citizens cooked and ate the wheat without taking time to grind it into flour. Thus, on St. Lucy's Day, Sicilians do not eat anything made with wheat flour.

Christmas lunch usually consists of turkey served with potatoes and vegetables (Malta is a former [[British colony]]). The island has adopted other popular secular customs and traditions such as the Christmas tree and Father Christmas.\n\nPresents are normally generally exchanged either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. A local seasonal food is the \"Qaghaq ta' l-Ghasel\" (Honey Ring). These Maltese Christmas sweets are eaten as a dessert during the Christmas season but can also be purchased all year round. Christmas cribs are a popular and are seen in most homes.\n\nAnother Christmas tradition is the planting of [[common vetch]] seeds in flat-bottomed pots. They are planted around the beginning of December, normally placed on white cotton and watered every day whilst being kept in the dark all the time. They are usually taken out just before Christmas, and resemble long white spaghetti-like strands of leaves (since they would have grown in the dark).\n\n===== Portugal =====\n\n[[File:Christmas decorations in Braga (6).JPG|thumb|Christmas decorations in Braga]]\n\nChristmas, an [[Public holidays in Portugal|official holiday in Portugal]], is widely celebrated and is associated with family gatherings. People who have moved to the main cities, like [[Lisbon]] or [[Porto]], or even those who have emigrated to other countries, still travel to their home towns and villages to spend Christmas Eve with their families. After the ''Missa do galo'' (Rooster's Mass) that celebrates the birth of Christ, families gather around the ''Consoada'', the late supper held on Christmas Eve. The traditional dish is ''bacalhau com todos'' (dried codfish boiled with vegetables), although, in northern Portugal, the bacalhau is often replaced by octopus. The Christmas dinner usually ends with ''fatias douradas'' (golden slices), ''filhoses'' and ''sonhos'' (dreams), all desserts based on fried flour or fried bread. Another traditional cake is the ''Bolo Rei'' ([[Bolo Rei|king cake]]) served on Epiphany. Nowadays, although Santa Claus (''Pai Natal'') is more popular, in some regions people still believe that it is the ''Menino Jesus'' (Baby Jesus) who brings presents to children.\n\n===== Serbia and Montenegro=====\n\n[[File:Christmas-Serbian Ortodox \u010cesnica.jpg|thumb|Serbian Orthodox Christmas bread]]\n\n{{Main|Serbian Christmas traditions|Badnjak (Serbian)}}\n\nIn Serbia and Montenegro, Christmas ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b, ''Bo\u017ei\u0107'' or more formally \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e, Rozhdestvo Hristovo, \"Nativity of Christ\") is celebrated for three consecutive days, beginning with Christmas Day. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] uses the traditional Julian calendar, per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls on January 7. This day is called the first day of Christmas, and the following two are accordingly called the second, and the third day of Christmas. During this festive time, one is to greet another person with \"Christ is Born,\" which should be responded to with \"Truly He is Born.\" The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] name for Christmas is ''Bo\u017ei\u0107'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b, {{IPA-sh|bo\u0292it\u0255|pron}}), which means the young or little God.\n\nThis holiday surpasses all the others celebrated by [[Serbs]], with respect to the diversity of applied folk customs and rituals. These may vary from region to region, some of them having modern versions adapted to the contemporary way of living. The ideal environment to carry them out fully is the traditional multi-generation country household.\n\nIn the morning of Christmas Eve a young, straight oak tree is selected and felled by the head of the household. A log is cut from it and is referred to as the [[Badnjak (Serbian)|badnjak]]. In the evening, the badnjak is ceremoniously put on the domestic fire that burns on the house's fireplace called ''ognji\u0161te'', whose hearth is without a vertical surround. The burning of the ''badnjak'' is accompanied by prayers to God so that the coming year may bring much happiness, love, luck, riches, and food. Since most houses today have no ''ognji\u0161te'' on which to burn a ''badnjak'', it is symbolically represented by several leaved oak twigs. For the convenience of people who live in towns and cities, they can be bought at marketplaces or received in churches.\n\nThe dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in foods, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting. Groups of young people go from house to house of their village or neighbourhood, congratulating each other, singing, and making performances; this continues through the next three days. The Serbs also take a bundle of straw into the house and spread it over the floor, and then put walnuts on it. Before the table is served for the Christmas Eve dinner, it is strewn with a thin layer of straw and covered with a white cloth. The head of household makes the [[Sign of the Cross]], lights a candle, and [[Censer|cense]]s the whole house. The family members sit down at the table, but before tucking in they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they together sing the [[Troparion]] of the Nativity.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Hymns of the Feast\n| url = http://www.goarch.org/special/listen_learn_share/nativity\n| work = Feast of the Nativity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\n| publisher = [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]\n| year = 2009}}</ref>\nAfter the dinner young people visit their friends, a group of whom may gather at the house of one of them. Christmas and other songs are sung, while the elderly narrate stories from the olden times.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells and by shooting. A big importance is given to the first visit a family receives that day. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year; this visit is often pre-arranged. Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. A special, festive loaf of bread is baked for this occasion. The main course is roast pork of a pig which they cook whole by rotating it impaled on a wooden spit close to an open fire. Even though gift-giving is not necessarily a part of the tradition, a [[Santa Claus]] inspired character called Bo\u017ei\u0107 Bata (translated as Christmas friend) sometimes takes his during gift giving, as Santa Claus is more traditionally connected to New Years celebrations. Gift-giving is, nevertheless, connected with the celebrations, being traditionally done on the three consecutive Sundays that immediately precede it. Children, women, and men, respectively, are the set gift-givers on these three days.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. The course of these celebrations can be typically divided into three parts: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of going and cutting down the tree to be used as the ''badnjak'', taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes [[Vespers]], placing the ''badnjak'' on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the ''badnjak'', and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the ''badnjak'' not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of getting together around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration, however, has its own specificities which reflect traditions of the local community, and other local factors.\n\nIn Serbia, Montenegro and [[North Macedonia]] Christmas is celebrated on January 7. This is a result of their [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches marking Christmas Day based on the [[Julian calendar]], which is now 13&nbsp;days behind the internationally used Gregorian calendar.\n\n===== Spain =====\n\n[[File:Spain.Barcelona.Porta.Angel.Navidad.jpg|thumb|Avinguda Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, at Christmas time, [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\nChristmas and St Stephen's Day are [[Public holidays in Spain|officially recognized holidays in Spain]]. In most of Spain, the Christmas period, referred to as \"Navidad\", lasts from Christmas Eve referred to as \"Nochebuena\" or \"the Good Night.\" on December 24 to Epiphany on January 6. Many homes and most churches display a [[Nativity scene]], a [[Christmas tree]], or both. The ''pesebre'' (nativity scene) is present in many homes, schools and stores. On the 26th, ''Sant Esteve'' (Saint Stephen) is celebrated with a family gathering.\n\nA large family dinner is celebrated on Christmas Eve (Nochebuena) and can last until 6&nbsp;o'clock in the morning. There is a wide variety of typical foods one might find on plates across Spain on this particular night, and each [[Regional food|region]] has its own distinct specialities. It is particularly common, however, to start the meal with a seafood dish such as prawns or salmon, followed by a bowl of hot, homemade soup. The main meal will commonly consist of [[Lamb (food)|roast lamb]], or seafood, such as cod or shellfish. For dessert, there is quite a spread of delicacies, among them are [[turr\u00f3n]], a dessert made of honey, egg and almonds that is Arabic in origin. Special dishes and desserts include Mariscos y Pescado (shellfish and fish), [[marzipan]], Pavo Trufado de Navidad (turkey with [[truffles]]), and [[polvorones]] (shortbread made of almonds, flour and sugar).\n\nEven though there is still the traditional [[Misa del Gallo]] at midnight, few Spaniards continue to follow the old custom of attending.\n\nChildren usually receive one or two presents on Christmas Day (December 25), brought by \"Pap\u00e1 Noel\" (Father Noel), which is a non-traditional imitation of the American Santa Claus, but in some regions there are other more traditional characters, for example, the [[Olentzero]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. There is a special Christmas dance called the Jota which has been performed for centuries in Spain during Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/spanishchristmas.htm|title=Christmas Traditions in Spain|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn December 31 (Nochevieja) there is also a large family feast. Some young people go out in \"cotill\u00f3n\", a very big feast in bars and pubs and the drink and dance until January 1 morning, when they have [[Churros|churros with chocolate]] for breakfast. On January 5 a huge parade (La Cabalgata or [[cavalcade]]) welcomes the Three Kings to the city. Children put their shoes in the window on January 5 in the hope that the Three Wise Men will deliver them presents.<ref>''Christmas.'' World Book Encyclopedia 2003 edition. Volume Ch.

Children do not hang Christmas stockings but put their shoes by the fireplace or under the Christmas tree so ''P\u00e8re No\u00ebl'' (Father Christmas or Santa Claus) can give them gifts (a practice also among [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]]). Some families also attend midnight mass and decorate their homes with Nativity Scenes depicting the birth of Jesus. Additional ''Santons'' (little saints) may be added in the nativity scenes.\n\nIn France and in other [[francophone|French-speaking]] areas (see French Canada), a long family dinner, called a ''[[r\u00e9veillon]]'', is held on Christmas Eve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |title=R\u00e9veillon |publisher=VirtualMuseum.ca |date=December 1, 1995 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523234250/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2001  }}</ref> The name of this dinner is based on the word ''r\u00e9veil'' (meaning \"waking\"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. R\u00e9veillon is generally of an exceptional or luxurious nature. [[Appetizer]]s may include [[lobster]], [[oyster]]s, [[escargot]]s or [[foie gras]], etc. One traditional dish is [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] with [[chestnut]]s. R\u00e9veillons in [[Quebec]] will often include some variety of [[tourti\u00e8re]]. Dessert may consist of a ''[[b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl]]''. In [[Provence]], the tradition of the ''13 desserts'' is followed, almost invariably including: ''pompe \u00e0 l'huile'' (a flavoured bread), [[date (fruit)|date]]s, etc. Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] or similar [[sparkling wine]]s as a conclusion. Christmas carols may also be sung.\n\n===== United Kingdom =====\n\n[[File:Trafalgar Square Christmas Carols - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas Tree and carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London]]\nIn the United Kingdom Christmas decorations are put up in shops and town centres from early November. Many towns and cities have a public event involving a local or regional celebrity to mark the switching on of Christmas lights. Decorations in people's homes are commonly put up from early December, traditionally including a Christmas tree, cards, and lights both inside and outside the home. Every year, Norway donates a giant Christmas tree for the British to raise in Trafalgar Square as a thank you for helping during the [[Second World War]]. Christmas carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London sing around the tree on various evenings up until Christmas Eve and Christmas decorations are traditionally left up until the evening of January 5 (the night before Epiphany); it is considered bad luck to have Christmas decorations up after this date. In practice, many Christmas traditions, such as the playing of Christmas music, largely stop after Christmas Day.<ref>{{cite web|website=Woodlands-Junior.Kent.sch.uk|url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|title=British Christmas: introduction, food, customs|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220220018/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|archivedate=February 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Mince pie]]s are traditionally sold during the festive season and are a popular food for Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projectbritain.com/Xmas/dinner.html|title=Christmas dinner|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> It is common in many UK households for children and adults to put up advent calendars in their homes, which may either contain chocolates or Christmas scenes behind their doors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nA common feature of the Christmas season is the Nativity play which is practiced in most primary and some secondary schools across the UK.

In public, there are decorations and lights in most shops, especially in town centres, and even in Indian and Chinese restaurants. Churches and [[cathedral]]s across the country hold masses, with many people going to midnight mass or a service on Christmas morning. Even though church attendance has been falling over the decades some people who do not go to church often think it is still important to go at Christmas, so Church attendance increases. Most theatres have a tradition of putting on a Christmas [[pantomime]] for children. The pantomime stories are traditionally based on popular children's stories such as ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and ''[[Aladdin]]'', rather than being directly concerned with Christmas as such, although there is sometimes a link.

Many neighbours and friends attend each other's houses for Christmas drinks and parties on the days leading up to and after Christmas Day. Although religious devotion in Ireland today is considerably less than it used to be, there are huge attendances at religious services for Christmas Day, with Midnight Mass a popular choice. Most families arrange for their deceased relatives to be prayed for at these Masses as it is a time of remembering the dead in Ireland. It is traditional to decorate graves at Christmas with a wreath made of holly and ivy. Even in the most undevout of homes in Ireland the traditional crib takes centre stage along with the Christmas tree as part of the family's decorations. Some people light candles to signify symbolic hospitality for [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. Therefore, it is usual to see a white candle, or candle set, placed in several windows around people's homes. The candle was a way of saying there was room for [[Jesus]]'s parents in these homes even if there was none in [[Bethlehem]].<ref name=\"CID\">{{cite web |url=http://www.christmasindublin.com/traditions.html |title=Irish Christmas Traditions |publisher=ChristmasinDublin.com |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810083446/http://christmasindublin.com/Traditions.html |archivedate=August 10, 2003  }}</ref> It is traditional to leave a [[mince pie]] and a bottle or a glass of [[Guinness]] for [[Santa Claus]] along with a carrot for [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer|Rudolph]] on Christmas Eve.\n\nSanta Claus, often known in Ireland simply as Santy or ''Daid\u00ed na Nollag'' in [[Irish language|Irish]], brings presents to children in Ireland, which are opened on Christmas morning. Family and friends also give each other gifts at Christmas. The traditional Christmas dinner consists of turkey or goose and ham with a selection of vegetables and a variety of potatoes, as potatoes still act as a staple food in Ireland despite the popularisation of staples such as rice and pasta. Dessert is a very rich selection of Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, and mince pies with equally rich sauces such as brandy butter.\n\nChristmas celebrations in Ireland finish with the celebration of [[Little Christmas]] also known as O\u00edche Nollaig na mBan in Irish on January 6.

The Dutch recognize two days of Christmas as public holidays in the Netherlands, calling December 25 Eerste Kerstdag (\"first Christmas day\") and December 26 Tweede Kerstdag (\"second Christmas day\"). In families, it is customary to spend these days with either side of the family.\n\nIn Catholic parts of the country, it used to be common to attend Christmas Eve midnight mass; this custom is upheld, but mostly by the elder generation and by fewer people every year. Christmas Eve is these days a rather normal evening without any special gatherings or meals. On Christmas Day, throughout both Flanders and the Netherlands elaborated meals are prepared by the host or together as a family. Also meals of which every participant / guest is preparing one dish are very common. Christmas decorations start appearing in stores right after [[Sinterklaas]]. The week before Christmas is important to the retail trade, because this is the biggest sales week in the country. Christmas songs are heard everywhere. The cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Eindhoven are the busiest cities in terms of entertainment on Christmas Day. Traditionally, people in the Netherlands and Flanders do not exchange gifts on Christmas, since this is already done during a separate holiday ([[Sinterklaas]]) a few weeks before Christmas. However, more and more people have in the 2000s and 2010s started to give presents on Christmas as well, possibly under the influence of commerce and that from other countries where Christmas is celebrated with lots of presents (notably the USA). In the north / eastern, the [[West Low German]] part of the Netherlands, some people will blow the [[Midwinter horn]]s from [[Advent]] until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n\nThe Christmas season wraps up after the new year with Epiphany, or \"Driekoningen\". On January 6 children especially in the north of the Netherlands dress up as the Three Wise Men and travel in groups of three carrying lanterns, re-enacting the Epiphany and singing traditional songs for their hosts. In return they are rewarded with cakes and sweets. This practice is less common south of the great rivers. In the south and east of the Netherlands it is common practice to burn the Christmas trees of the community on a big pile on January 6 to celebrate the end of Christmas and the start of the new year.\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\n==== Australia ====\n{{see also|Christmas in Australia}}\n[[File:Christmas Belles at Crown - 11366677816.jpg|thumb|The Christmas Belles performing at Melbourne Crown atrium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peninsulakids.com.au/christmas-city/|title=Melbourne Christmas city|work=Mornington Peninsula Kids|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weekendnotes.com/free-christmas-events-melbourne/|title=Christmas events Melbourne|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>]]\nIn Australia, as with all of the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas occurs during the height of the summer season. Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 25\u201326) are recognized as [[Public holidays in Australia|national public holidays in Australia]], and workers are therefore entitled to a day off with pay.\n\nThe Australian traditions and decorations are quite similar to those of the United Kingdom and North America, and similar wintry iconography is commonplace. This means a red fur-coated Santa Claus riding a sleigh, carols such as \"Jingle Bells\", and various snow-covered Christmas scenes on Christmas cards and decorations appear in the middle of summer. There have also been depictions of Christmas traditions tailored to Australian iconography, such as Santa partaking in activities such as [[surfing]] (in 2015, a world record was set on [[Bondi Beach]] for the world's largest surf lesson, featuring 320 participants in Santa suits), parodies of traditional carols, and original songs such as [[Rolf Harris]]'s ''Six White Boomers'' (which depicts Santa Claus as using a [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] pulled by [[kangaroo]]s instead of reindeer and a sleigh).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/surfing-santas-set-new-world-record-in-australia-a6775186.html|title=Surfing Santas set new world record in Australia|date=December 16, 2015|website=The Independent|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiantimes.co.uk/10-greatest-ever-australian-christmas-songs/|title=10 greatest ever Australian Christmas songs|date=December 13, 2018|website=Australian Times News|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/christine-anu-where-is-all-the-australian-christmas-music-20141223-12bxo7.html|title=Christine Anu: Where is all the Australian Christmas music?|last=Vincent|first=Peter|date=December 21, 2014|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nA notable Christmas event in Australia is ''[[Carols by Candlelight]]''\u2014an annual concert and charity appeal benefiting the charity [[Vision Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/m22tvmon-20181213-h193mq.html|title=Monday Picks: Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight, Donna Hay, and more|last=McManus|first=Bridget|date=December 22, 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/outer-east/christmas-2018-peter-casey-prepares-for-final-carols-by-candlelight/news-story/618dcbe188d6fcb4a2cb8557bb9b7572|title=Christmas 2018: Peter Casey prepares for final Carols By Candlelight|website=Herald Sun|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{see also|Christmas in New Zealand}}\n[[File:Pohutukawa flowers.JPG|thumb|upright=.7|The December-flowering [[Metrosideros excelsa|pohutukawa]] (''Metrosideros excelsa''), an often-used Christmas symbol in New Zealand]]\nChristmas Day and Boxing Day are both [[Public holidays in New Zealand|statutory holidays in New Zealand]].

Since the Julian calendar is thirteen days behind the Gregorian Calendar, when the Armenians of Jerusalem celebrate Christmas on January 6 according to the Julian calendar the Gregorian calendar counts the day as January 19.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world\" />\n\nTraditionally, Armenians fast during the week leading up to Christmas avoiding all meat, eggs, and dairy products.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world\" /> Devout Armenians may even refrain from food for the three days leading up to the Christmas Eve, in order to receive the Eucharist on a \"pure\" stomach. Christmas Eve is particularly rich in traditions. Families gather for the Christmas Eve dinner (''khetum'', \u053d\u0569\u0578\u0582\u0574), which generally consists of: rice, fish, ''nevik'' (\u0576\u0578\u0582\u056b\u056f, a vegetable dish of green chard and chick peas), and yogurt/wheat soup (''tanabur'', \u0569\u0561\u0576\u0561\u057a\u0578\u0582\u0580). Dessert includes dried fruits and nuts, including ''rojik'', which consists of whole shelled walnuts threaded on a string and encased in grape jelly, ''bastukh'' (a paper-like confection of grape jelly, cornstarch, and flour), etc. This lighter menu is designed to ease the stomach off the week-long fast and prepare it for the rather more substantial Christmas Day dinner. Children take presents of fruits, nuts, and other candies to older relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/armenia.shtml|title=Christmas in Armenia|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> \"On the eve of the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany of The Lord Jesus Christ, the Jrakalouyts Divine Liturgy (the lighting of the lamps service) is celebrated in honor of the manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God (theophany)\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Nativity and Theophany of Our Lord \"Overview\"|url=http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/feasts/feastschristmas/about/|website=www.armenianchurch-ed.net|publisher=Armenian Church|accessdate=November 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029105927/http://www.armenianchurch-ed.net/feasts/feastschristmas/about|archive-date=October 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to the Christmas tree (''tonatsar'', \u054f\u0585\u0576\u0561\u056e\u0561\u057c), Armenians (particularly in the Middle East) also erect the Nativity scene. Christmas in the Armenian tradition is a purely religious affair. Santa Claus does not visit the nice Armenian children on Christmas, but rather on New Year's Eve. The idea of Santa Claus existed before the Soviet Union and he was named '' kaghand papik'' (\u053f\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0576\u0564 \u054a\u0561\u057a\u056b\u056f), but the Soviet Union had a great impact even on Santa Claus.

Assyrians colloquially call Christmas ''Eda Zora,'' meaning \"little holiday.\" It is officially called ''Eda d'Yalde'' which means \"birthday holiday.\" Traditionally, Assyrians fast (''sawma'') from December 1 until Christmas Day. In Iraq, for instance, on Christmas Eve, Assyrian families congregate outside of their house and hold lighted candles while a child reads aloud the nativity story. Then they all sing psalms over a bonfire made of thorn bushes. Folklore says that if the thorns burn to ashes, the family will have good luck. After the fire has been reduced to ashes, the family members will jump three times over the ashes and make a wish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|title=Christmas Traditions|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207065201/http://www.chaldeannews.com/christmas-traditions/|archivedate=December 7, 2014}}</ref> The next day, on Christmas, \"as another bonfire burns in the churchyard, the bishops lead the service while carrying a figure of the baby Jesus.

On Christmas Day, when families gather together after the ''Shaharta'' or morning mass, ''raza d'mowlada d'maran,'' the fast is broken by eating traditional Assyrian foods such as ''pacha/reesh-aqle'' (meaning \"from the head to the tail\"), which is a boiled soup made of sheep or cow intestines, tongue, stomach, legs, and spices or ''harissa'', a porridge made of ground wheat and chicken (both dishes are prepared usually overnight). These two dishes are only made twice a year: on Christmas and Easter. Traditional desserts eaten after the main course include Killeche, a date and walnut-stuffed cookie, and Kadeh, another stuffed pastry. After the feast is finished, Assyrians will visit the houses of family and friends to exchange Christmas greetings, saying, \"''Eedokhon breekha,''\" meaning \"May your feast be blessed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-ix-assyrian/|title=FESTIVALS ix.Assyrian|author=Encyclopedia Iranica|date=2012}}</ref> There, the host will serve tea, Turkish coffee, and Killeche and Kadeh to guests.

Other observances considered part of the season (and potentially included in non-denominational [[holiday greetings]] like \"Happy Holidays\") include [[Hanukkah]], [[Yule]], Epiphany, [[Kwanzaa]], and [[winter solstice]] celebrations.

But because Brazil lies in the Southern Hemisphere, Brazilians celebrate Christmas in the summer. In the small cities in the entire country, as well as in the largest cities, like S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Goi\u00e2nia, Bras\u00edlia, Manaus, Bel\u00e9m, Natal and Belo Horizonte, the celebrations resemble in many ways the traditions in Europe and North America, with the Christmas tree, the exchanging of gifts and Christmas cards, the decoration of houses and buildings with electric lights and the nativity scene. Despite the warm tropical summer weather, some incongruences such as decorations with themes of winter and snow are not uncommon. In some cities like [[Guarapuava]], there are decoration contests, when judges go to houses to look at the decorations, inside or outside of the house, and decide the most beautiful house. Christmas Eve is the most important day. Unlike in the North American and Anglo-Saxon tradition, Christmas takes action mainly near midnight, usually with big family dinners, opening of gifts and the celebration of the \"Missa do Galo\" (the rooster's mass) in churches throughout the nation.\n\nMany Brazilians decorate their homes with a Christmas Tree, there is no rule, the parents can decorate it by themselves as a surprise to the kids, or they can do it together. In addition to the Christmas tree, many families set up a Nativity scene as the main decoration. Nativity scenes are very popular in Brazil, and can be seen everywhere including churches and popular places around the town. Like many other countries, Christmas dinner in Brazil is normally served late in the evening on Christmas Eve around 10 or 11 p.m. The meal often includes farofa stuffing, assortments of fruit, fried cod, and roast turkey with a dessert called \"[[rabanada]]\". Along with their meals, Brazilians typically drink champagne, wine, and fruit punch. Typically after they eat, many Brazilians attend a Midnight Mass service or watch the Pope's television broadcast celebration of \"Midnight Mass in Rome\" with family and friends.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Christmas : nearly 200 alphabetically arranged entries covering all aspects of Christmas, including folk customs, religious observances, history, legends, symbols, and related days from Europe, America, and around the world\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1159225.Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|title=Encyclopedia_Of_Christmas|publisher=www.goodreads.com|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===== Colombia =====\n[[File:Christmas2004inMedell\u00edn.JPG|thumb|[[Medell\u00edn River]] during the [[Christmas lights in Medell\u00edn|Lighting of Medellin]]]]\n\nChristmas is a [[Public holidays in Colombia|public holiday in Colombia]] and is primarily a religious celebration. Presents are brought by ''El Ni\u00f1o Jesus / Ni\u00f1o Dios'' (Baby Jesus).\n\nWhile Christmas decorations may be put up as early as the beginning of November, the unofficial start of Colombian Christmas festivities takes place on December 7, [[D\u00eda de las Velitas]], or \"Day of the Candles.\" At night, the streets, sidewalks, balconies, porches, and driveways are decorated with candles and paper lanterns, which illuminate cities and towns in a yellow glow to honor the Immaculate Conception on the following day, December 8. In many cities, and even in small rural towns, neighborhoods get together and decorate their whole neighborhood or street, turning streets into virtual \"tunnels of light.\" Many radio stations and local organizations hold contests for the best display of lights, making the competition for the best light show a serious event. The city of Medell\u00edn has become a popular tourist destination during the holiday season because of its [[Christmas lights in Medell\u00edn|Christmas lights]]. Activities such as musical events and firework displays are planned by cities and held during this time. Individually launched fireworks were a common item during the Christmas season in Colombia, often going on at any time of the day in many cities. However, a recent ban has decreased the individual use of fireworks, and now only cities or towns are able to hold firework displays.\n\nDecember 16 is the first day of the Christmas [[Novena]], a devotion consisting of prayer said on nine successive days, the last one held on Christmas Eve. The Novena is promoted by the Catholic Church as a staple of Christmas, and is very similar to the [[Las Posadas|posadas]] celebrated in Mexico. It is a call for an understanding of the religious meaning of Christmas, and a way to counter the commercialism of the Christmas season. Individual traditions concerning the Novena may vary, but most families set up a \"pesebre\" (manger scene), sing religious Christmas carols called [[villancicos]] accompanied by tambourines, bells, and other simple percussion instruments, and read verses from the Bible as well as an interpretation which may change from year to year. Novenas serve as beautiful religious gatherings as well as learning environments for young children since kids have a central and active role in the celebration of the Novenas (they read prayers, sing, and play instruments guided by their family). From December 16 to 24, games called \"aguinaldos\"<ref name=\"aguinaldos-colombia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-178186.html|title=Colombia Aprende \u2013 A jugar aguinaldos|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084849/http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-178186.html|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> are played after having made a \"pinky promise\" deciding the prize for the winner and the punishment for the loser. The games include \"Hablar y no contestar\" (Talk but don't answer), \"D\u00e9 pero no reciben\" (Give but don't receive), \"Pajita en boca\" (Straw in the mouth), \"Tres pies\" (Three feet), \"Beso robado\" (Stolen kisses), and \"Si y al no\" (Yes or no). Churches offer dawn and nightly masses during the nine days of the novena, culminating with the [[Misa de Gallo]] (Rooster's Mass) on Christmas Eve at midnight.\n\nChristmas Eve is the most important day of Christmas in Colombia. Families and friends get together to pray the last Novena and wait until midnight to open the presents, parties are held until sunrise on [[Christmas Day]], kids stay up late playing with their new presents, and fireworks fill the skies. Families gather around meals, music, and singing. Because Christmas Eve is the most important day, little occurs on December 25. Families join Christmas Day mass although it is not nearly as festive as Christmas Eve.\n\nThe \"Dia de los Santos Inocentes\", or the [[Day of the Innocents]], falls in the Christmas season, on December 28. The day commemorates the innocent infants (called the innocent ones) who were said to have been killed by [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in fear of the power of the newborn baby, Jesus. January 6, the day of the Revelation of the Magi (Epiphany), is called \"Reyes Magos\" (from [[The Three Magi]]), used to be a day of gift giving, but is celebrated less now since gifts are given mostly around Christmas Eve today. Some families still give presents, and it is also the day when godparents give Christmas presents.\n\n===== El Salvador =====\nChristmas for El Salvador still carries a strong meaning that brings families together. Despite the business on the streets and the red, green and white colors flooding the environment, Salvadoran people try to honor what they consider to be the true meaning of Christmas, the birth of Jesus.\nIn El Salvador children celebrate Christmas by playing with [[firecracker]]s, fountains, such as the small ''volcancitos'' (\"little volcanos\") and sparklers, ''estrellitas'' (\"little stars\"). Teenagers and young adults display bigger [[fireworks]] or [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman Candle]]s. Families also have parties in which they dance and eat. \nSanta Claus is known for appearing in TV and print ads, but people ask children if they already wrote a letter to little baby Jesus. Traditional Salvadoran Christmas dishes are sauteed turkey sandwiches in a baguette with lettuce and radishes, [[Salvadoran Tamales]], and sweet bread for dessert. Drinks include [[hot chocolate]], [[pineapple]] juice, Salvadoran [[horchata]], Cherry Salvadoran horchata, and coffee. At 12:00&nbsp;a.m. on December 25 everyone gathers around the [[Christmas tree]] and opens their presents.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===== Guatemala =====\nOn Christmas in Guatemala, people [[Dress-Up|dress up]] in an ornamental hat, called a ''Puritina'', and dance in a line.

Mexico's\nChristmas is filled with over 30 traditions found only within Mexican Christmas. Over nine days, groups of townspeople go from door to door in a fashion of when the parents of the unborn baby Jesus Christ looked for shelter to pass the night when they arrived at Bethlehem, and are periodically called inside homes to participate in the breaking of a candy-filled [[pi\u00f1ata]].\n\nMexican Christmas festivities start on December 12, with the feast of La Guadalupana ([[Virgin of Guadalupe]]), and end on January 6, with the Epiphany. Since the 1990s, Mexican society has embraced a new concept linking several celebrations around Christmas season into what is known as the [[Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon]]. At midnight on Christmas, many families place the figure of baby Jesus in their ''nacimientos'' ([[Nativity scene]]s), as the symbolic representation of Christmas as a whole. In the center and south of Mexico, children receive gifts on Christmas Eve and on January 6, they celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, when, according to tradition, the Three Wise Men (3 Wizard Kings) brought gifts to Bethlehem for Jesus Christ. Santa Claus (or Santa Clos, as he's known in Mexico<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/mexicanchristmas.htm |title=Christmas in Mexico |work=Santas.net |publisher=Australian Media Pty Ltd. |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>) is who brings the children their gifts, but traditionally the Three Wise Men will fill the children's shoes with candies, oranges, tangerines, nuts, and sugar cane, and sometimes money or gold. For the Three Wise Men gave Baby Jesus Gold for his future.\n\n===== Venezuela =====\n[[File:Paradura del ni\u00f1o, Baruta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Different moments of [[Paradura del Ni\u00f1o]], Venezuelan tradition celebrated on February 2]]\n\nIn Venezuela, Christmas is celebrated as a religious occasion. As in Colombia, the presents are brought by \"El Ni\u00f1o Jesus\" (Baby Jesus) instead of \"Pap\u00e1 No\u00e9l\" (Santa Claus), that still has an important role during this season.\n\nThe unofficial start of the Christmas festivities is after the celebrations of \"[[Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquir\u00e1#Annual Celebration|Feria de la Chinita]]\", the second half of November. The origin of this festival is the cult to Virgin Mary of [[Chiquinquir\u00e1]], when various religious activities, processions, and music in the typical \"[[Gaita (music style)|Gaita style]]\" to honor \"La [[Chinita]]\" (nickname of this Virgin). This event takes place in the Zulia Region, specifically in Maracaibo (the regional capital). After this, other cities join in the festivities and many activities take place including musical events and firework displays.\n\nIn many cities, small rural towns and neighborhoods get together for the \"patinatas\" night festivals where children go and play with skateboards, roller blades and bicycles. These events are usually sponsored by the local church, where neighbors organize themselves and sell typical Christmas food, hot chocolate, [[hallaca]], cookies, etc. Also still in some neighborhoods there is the \"[[Parranda]]\" where people go from one house to house with music and Christmas songs. The singers stops at neighbors' houses to get some food and drinks. Also in the Venezuelan Andes there is the same tradition of this kind of event but they carry an image of \"baby Jesus\" and this is called \"[[Paradura del Ni\u00f1o]].\" Children write request letters to Baby Jesus. The presents are sent by Baby Jesus at midnight, and most people have a party, which goes on until sunrise.\n\n==== Caribbean ====\n\n===== Bahamas =====\n[[Junkanoo]] festivals are held Boxing Day, December 26 and again on New Year's Day. It is a local cultural event dating back to it African heritage  featuring goat skin drums, cowbell and brass instruments with choreographed dancers dressed in traditional one of kind and handmaid colorful costumes, singing and dancing\n\nBahamian Christmas foods include benny cake, coconut cake, flour cake from Acklins and Cat Island, fruit cake, baked ham and turkey, traditional peas and rice, baked macaroni, coleslaw, plantains, fried fish, boiled fish (Nassau Grouper and snappers) and Johnny cake. Drinks like eggnog, lemonade and local beers (Kalik and Sands) are also served on Christmas.\n\n===== Cuba =====\nCuba had a long tradition of celebrating Christmas. Families used to gather at the dining table, and used to go to mass after dinner.\nThe Communist Regime led by Fidel Castro abolished the paid Christmas holiday in 1969, citing that workers were needed to continue the sugar harvest. In 1998, the Regime declared December 25 a leisure day, as requested by Pope John Paul II as a condition to visit the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/cuba-ends-its-30year-ban-on-christmas-1193525.html|title=Cuba ends its 30-year ban on Christmas|work=The Independent}}</ref> It is a one-day public holiday and it is celebrated only in the evening.\n\n===== Jamaica =====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nRadio stations play Christmas carols as early as October, reggae style and some international.

This includes street dancing and a great parade through the streets with Jamaicans dressed in colorful masquerade costumes in which masks are worn.\n\nThe traditional Jamaican Christmas meal includes [[ackee]], saltfish, breadfruit, fried plantains, boiled bananas, freshly squeezed fruit juice and tea for breakfast; chicken, [[curried goat]], stewed oxtail, rice and [[gungo peas]] for dinner. For dessert, [[sorrel drink]] and a Jamaican rum fruitcake along with red wine are served in many homes.\n\nMany people attend church for Christmas Eve or Christmas morning worship service.\n\nSome people to go the Christmas Eve Grand Market, where you walk with family and friends and buy whatever you want and go home 2:00 or 3:00&nbsp;am Christmas Day.\n\nSome British Christmas traditions have stayed in Jamaica, like Father Christmas, roast beef or lamb dinners, Boxing Day, etc.\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== Central Europe ====\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[File:Adventskranz von oben.jpg|thumb|Christmas wreath]]\n\nIn countries of Central Europe (for this purpose, roughly defined as the German-speaking countries of Germany, Austria and Switzerland as well as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary and possibly other places) the main celebration date for the general public is Christmas Eve (December 24). The day is usually a fasting day; in some places children are told they'll see a ''golden pig'' if they hold fast until after dinner. When the evening comes preparation of Christmas Dinner starts. Traditions concerning dinner vary from region to region, for example, in Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, the prevailing meal is fried [[carp]] with potato salad and fish (or cabbage) soup. However, in some places the tradition is porridge with mushrooms (a modest dish), and elsewhere the dinner is exceptionally rich, with up to 12 dishes. This in fact reveals that when Christmas comes around all the kids get presents from neighbours and house guest. Even the house pet got a little something to gnaw on.\n\nAfter the dinner comes the time for gifts. Children usually find their gifts under the Christmas Tree, with name stickers. An interesting example of complicated history of the region is the \"fight\" between Christmas beings. During communism, when countries of Central Europe were under Soviet influence, communist authorities strongly pushed Russian traditional ''Ded Moroz'' (\"Grandfather Frost\") in the place of Little Jesus won. Now [[Santa Claus]] is attacking, by means of advertising and Hollywood film production. Many people, Christians as well as people with just a Christian background, go to [[Roman Catholic]] midnight mass celebration.\n\nOther common attributes of Christmas in Central Europe include Christmas trees, mistletoe, Christmas garlands, and Bethlehem cribs.\n\nIn many areas of Central Europe, St. Nicholas (Hungarian: Mikul\u00e1s, Czech: Mikul\u00e1\u0161, Polish: Miko\u0142aj, Slovak: Mikul\u00e1\u0161, Slovene: Miklav\u017e), or Santa Claus, does not come for Christmas. He visits families earlier, on the dawn of St. Nicholas Day on December 6, and for the well-behaved children he has presents and candy-bags to put into their well polished shoes that were set in the windows the previous evening. Although he neither parks his sleigh on rooftops nor climbs chimneys, his visits are usually accompanied by a diabolic-looking servant named Krampusz (in Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia: Krampus, in Czech and Slovak regions he is simply \"\u010dert\", i.e. devil, without any name) who gives golden coloured birches for so called badly behaved children. Actually all children get both gifts and golden birches (Hungarian: ''virg\u00e1cs'') in their shoes, no matter how they behaved themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |title=Hungarian Heritage Museum |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815122913/http://www.jcu.edu/language/hunghemu/hunghe7g.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n===== Austria and Germany =====\n{{Main|Weihnachten}}\n\n[[File:Advent Bowl Rusch.jpg|thumb|right|Austrian Advent bowl]]\n\nIn some German-speaking communities, in the  German-speaking Europe; particularly in Catholic regions of western and southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, South Tyrol and Liechtenstein, as well as in other Catholic regions of Central Europe, the ''[[Christkind]]'' (literally \"Christ child\") brings the presents on the evening of December 24 (Holy Evening or Heiliger Abend).<ref name=forbes>Forbes, Bruce David, Christmas: a candid history, University of California Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-520-25104-0}}</ref>{{rp|68\u201379}} The Christkind is invisible; thus he is never seen by anyone. However, he rings a bell just before he leaves in order to let children know that the Christmas tree and the presents are ready.\n\nIt is a tradition to lavishly decorate a Christmas tree in the days directly before Christmas or on the morning of Christmas Eve. On late Christmas Eve, after the bell rings, the tree is shown to the children and presents are exchanged.\n\nIn [[Protestant church]]es, there is a service in the late afternoon intended to immediately precede the [[Christmas Eve]] meal and the exchanging of gifts. This service, called ''Christvesper'', consists most often of scriptural readings, the Christmas Gospel from Luke 2, a ''Krippenspiel'' (nativity play), favourite Christmas carols and festive music for organ and choirs. In some regions the tradition of ''[[Quempas]] singing'' is still popular. Some Lutheran churches also celebrate a candlelight service at midnight besides the Christmas Vespers in the afternoon or early evening.\n\nMany Catholic churches also have a first Mass of Christmas, called ''Christmette'', on \"Heiliger Abend\" about 4&nbsp;p.m. for the children and parents to attend before the families return home for their meal. The crib is a very important part of the celebrations in Catholic areas especially [[Bavaria]].\n\n====== Austria ======\n\n[[File:Wien Rathaus Christkindlmarkt Dez2006B.jpg|thumb|left|Christmas market in front of the town hall in [[Vienna]], Austria]]\n\nIn the largely Catholic Austria, [[Christmas markets]] are a long-standing tradition. In [[Vienna]], for instance, the market is held in the large square in front of City Hall. [[Innsbruck]] opens its romantic Christmas market in the narrow medieval square at the foot of the Golden Roof. In [[Salzburg]], the Christmas market takes over the square in front of the Cathedral with its picturesque stalls, while the tree vendors occupy Residenzplatz on the side of the huge Cathedral. However almost every small town has its own Christmas market.\n\nIn Austria, Christmas trees play a very important part of Christmas celebrations. Every town sets up its own huge tree on the main square all decorated with candles, ornaments and candies and frequently there will be an extra one, adorned with bread crumbs, for the birds. In families the tree is decorated with gold and silver ornaments or stars made out of straw, sweets and candy wrapped in tinfoil, gilded nuts, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austria.info/us/people-and-traditions/christmas-season-in-austria-1084204.html|title=Christmas Season in Austria|work=austria.info|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe feast of [[St Nicholas]] marks the beginning of Christmas in Austria.

Austrian Christmas tradition has it that it is the Christ Child himself who decorates the Christmas tree on [[Christmas Eve]] and brings the children their Christmas presents, and it is to him that their letters and wish lists are addressed in the weeks before Christmas. The Christmas Eve dinner is the main event of the night often served with fried carp. The famous [[sachertorte]] and different kinds of chocolates are served as dessert. The Austrians also have special crescent shaped cookies served during Christmas time.\n\n====== Germany ======\n[[File:Weihnachtssterne. Chemnitz.

Till the reformation [[Saint Nicholas Day#St. Nicholas Day|Saint Nicholas' Day]], December 6, Saint Nicholas was the main provider of Christmas presents. Nikolaus still puts goodies in children's shoes on that day. Sometimes St. Nicholas visits children in kindergarten, schools or at public events. They have to recite a short poem or sing a song in order to get sweets or a small gift. \"[[Knecht Ruprecht]]\" (the servant Ruprecht) \u2013 dressed in dark clothes with devil-like traits (usually noted as a long, bright red tongue and with a stick or a small whip in the hand) \u2013 sometimes accompanies St. Nicholas. His duty is to punish those children who haven't behaved during the year. Usually he doesn't have much to do. He merely stands near St. Nicholas as a warning to be good and polite. Nikolaus  as well for some Gl\u00fchwein for adults, there are some traditions connected with local firefighters, riders associations and church congregations.\n\nThe [[Sorbs]], a minority in Saxony and parts of Brandenbuerg with a language similar to Polish, have some specific traditions. E.g. in [[J\u00e4nschwalde]], the ''Bescherkind'' [[Jan\u0161ojski bog]] (\"presents kid\") is visiting the neighbors, a girl dressed in local costume and veil and goes around with two companions at the Wednesday before Christmas. It provides smaller presents like sweets, similar to the Nikolaus and provides blessings, stays however silent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bern.diplo.de/Vertretung/bern/de/12_20Adventskalender/17-_20sorbische_20Weihnachtsbraeuche.html|title=Deutsche Botschaft Bern|publisher=|access-date=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218064944/http://www.bern.diplo.de/Vertretung/bern/de/12_20Adventskalender/17-_20sorbische_20Weihnachtsbraeuche.html|archive-date=December 18, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another tradition in Saxony is related to the [[Wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains]], especially [[Seiffen]] provides Christmas related decorations like [[Christmas pyramid]] and toys around the year. [[Letters to Santa|Christmas letters]] may be addressed e.g. to [[Engelskirchen]] (Angel's church) or [[Himmelpforten]] (Heaven's gate) or some other in municipalities with matching names. After privatization, [[Deutsche Post]] kept the tradition of dedicated Christmas offices, one in each state, answering letters and requests from children.\n[[File:2014-12 Engel+Bergmann beleuchtet.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|Traditional [[Miner's figure]]s as Christmas  light bearers]]\nCurrently the actual Christmas gift-giving (German: \"Bescherung\") usually takes place on [[Christmas Eve]]. This tradition was introduced by [[Protestant Reformation|Reformator]], [[Martin Luther]], as he was of the opinion that one should put the emphasis on Christ's birth and not on a saint's day and do away with the connotation that gifts have to be earned by good behavior. The gifts should be seen as a symbol for the gift of God's grace in Christ.<ref>Ernst, Eugen: Weihnachten im Wandel der Zeiten, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2. Aufl. Darmstadt 2000, pp. 34 \u2013 35</ref> This tradition quickly became common in predominantly Catholic regions as well.\n\nGifts may be brought by the ''Weihnachtsmann'' (translation, \"Christmas man\"), who resembles either St. Nicholas or the [[American Santa Claus]], or by ''[[Christkind]]l'', a sprite-like child who may or may not represent the baby Jesus.<ref name=forbes/>{{rp|68\u201379}} Till 1930, there was sort of south north divide between the realms of southern and silesian Christkind and Nordic Weihnachtsmann. After the gifts are opened the children often stay up as late as they like, often till the early hours of the morning.\n\nThe Christmas Tree is first put up and decorated on the morning of the 24th. The gifts are then placed under the tree. Christmas services in the church serve as well to exchange greetings with neighbors and friends. After an evening meal one of the parents usually goes into the room where the tree is standing, lights the candles and rings a little bell. Then the children are allowed to go into the candlelit room. In many families it is still a custom to sing Christmas songs around the tree before opening up the presents. Some families attend a midnight church service \"Christmette\" after the evening meal and gift-giving.\n\nThe culinary feast either takes place at supper on Christmas Eve or on the first day of Christmas. Traditions vary from region to region; carp is eaten in many parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blcmasvoc.htm |title=German Christmas Vocabulary |publisher=German.about.com |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref> Potato salad with frankfurter or wiener-sausages is popular in some families. Another simple meal which some families favor, especially in regions where Christmas Eve still has the character of a [[fast day]], is vegetable or pea soup. In some regions, especially in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] where Danish influence is noticeable, a roasted duck or goose filled with plums, apples and raisins is family tradition. In other regions, especially in [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Pomerania]], many families prefer [[kale]] with boiled potatoes, special sausages and ham. Many families have developed new traditions for themselves and eat such meals as meat [[fondue]] or [[raclette]]. In almost all families in all parts of Germany you find a wide variety of Christmas cookies baked according to recipes typical for the family and the region.\n\n\"L\u00fcttenweihnachten\" describes the hunting and forestry custom of providing a Christmas tree with food decorated for animals.\n\n===== Czech Republic and Slovakia =====\n\n[[File:Christmas in Prague's Old Town Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Town Square]] in Prague, Czech Republic \u2013 Christmastime]]\n\n{{Main|Czech Christmas Mass}}\n\nChristmas Eve (December 24) is celebrated as ''\u0160t\u011bdr\u00fd den/\u0160tedr\u00fd de\u0148'', which means \"Generous Day\", when the gifts are given in the evening. The December 25 and 26 are [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic]] and [[Public holidays in Slovakia|in Slovakia]], but ''V\u00e1noce/Vianoce'' (Christmas), is most commonly associated with the 24th.\n\nAccording to tradition, gifts are brought by ''Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek/Je\u017ei\u0161ko'', or \"baby Jesus\". Fish soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad are a traditional dish for the dinner. In Slovakia, before eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other by sharing a piece of Christmas wafer (Obl\u00e1tky) with honey and walnuts. Traditional dinner depends on region, but common Christmas dinner is cabbage soup (Kapustnica) or lentil soup and breaded roasted carp with special homemade potato salad or hand made gnocchi with poppy (\u0161\u00fa\u013eanky s makom). The gifts are surreptitiously placed under the Christmas tree (usually a [[spruce]] or [[pine]] and lately fir), usually just before or during dinner. Children have to wait for the ringing of a Christmas bell (one of the decorations on the Christmas tree) \u2013 the sign that ''Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek/Je\u017ei\u0161ko'' (little Jesus) has just passed by \u2013 to run for the presents. That happens at the end of their Christmas dinner. There is a rich tradition of hard baked Christmas sweets (''Cukrov\u00ed/viano\u010dn\u00e9 kol\u00e1\u010de'').\n\nOther Czech and Slovak Christmas traditions involve predictions for the future. Apples are always cut crosswise: if a perfect star appears in the core, the next year will be successful, distorted star means a bad year or illness, while a cross may suggest death. Girls throw shoes over their shoulders \u2013 if the toe points to the door, the girl will get married soon. Another tradition requires pouring some molten lead into water and guessing a message from its shapes.\n\nIn Catholic Slovakia, the tradition of [[Jasli\u010dk\u00e1ri]] involves young men dressed as shepherds or angels visiting their neighbors and presenting recitations and songs about the story of the birth of Jesus.<ref name=\"Ball2003\">{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Ann|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjI9YQBFDGYC&pg=PA271|accessdate=November 20, 2015|year=2003|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|isbn=9780879739102|pages=271\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===== Hungary =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Hungary}}\nThe Christmas and gift-giving season starts relatively early compared to other cultures, with the Santa-like figure, or Hungarian version of Saint Nicholas, [[Mikul\u00e1s|Mikul\u00e1s (or Szent Mikl\u00f3s)]] traditionally visiting the homes of Hungarian children on the night of December 5, on the eve of Saint Nicholas Feast Day, December 6.\n\nAlthough the role of gift-giver on Christmas Day itself is assigned to the Christ Child, on the night before St. Nicholas Day Hungarian children traditionally place a boot on their windowsill waiting for Mikul\u00e1s to come by and fill it with treats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/hungary/ |title=St. Nicholas Around the World: Hungary |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}</ref> In Hungary, celebrations begin with Christmas tree decoration and gift packaging during daytime on December 24, then comes a family dinner with traditional Christmas meals.

This is the most intimate moment of Christmas, featuring warmly lit Christmas tree and candles, soft Christmas music, family singing of Christmas or religious songs and gift pack openings. There is also a popular folk custom during December and especially on Christmas Eve, in which children or adults present the birth of Jesus. The custom is called 'playing Bethlehem' (Hungarian: Betlehemez\u00e9s), and it is an acting performance, where the 'actors' are wearing costumes, and telling stories about the three kings, the shepherds, Mary, Joseph and of course the birth of the Holy Child.

Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. The dinner contains twelve dishes, one for each Apostle. In many homes, an extra place setting is set. The empty setting is symbolically left at the table for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, an angel, the [[Baby Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit should appear to share the feast.\n\nBefore eating, everyone exchanges Christmas greetings with each other. The supper begins with the breaking of the [[op\u0142atek]]. By sharing a piece of [[Christmas wafer]] (''Op\u0142atki''), when everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. The op\u0142atek is usually blessed by the presiding Bishop, and stamped with a religious image, such as the nativity scene, they then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table.\n\nA traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[barszcz]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (translated as \"little ears\", also known as meatless ravioli). The most common dishes are fish soup, with potato salad, [[pierogi]], [[go\u0142\u0105bki]] filled with [[kasza]], pickled [[herring]] and fruit [[kompot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/poland.shtml |title=Christmas in Poland |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>\nCarp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, herring fillets, herring in [[aspic]] and for dessert, [[makowiec (pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink. etc. Dishes beside fish are usually [[cabbage]]-, forest mushroom- (like [[boletus]]) and [[poppyseed]]-based, with herring being very important. After supper the Star Man arrives attended by the Star Boys. They are dressed as Wise Men or animals or other figures. The Star Man examines the children in their catechism and rewards them with small presents if they do well, even if they need a bit of coaching. The Star Boys sing carols and are given a treat for their help. The feast begins with the appearance of the first star. The meal is followed by the exchange of gifts.\nThe remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that \"The Little Star\" brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.\n\nChristmas Eve ends with [[Pasterka]], the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity.<ref name=\"pmkamsterdam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |title=Bo\u017ce Narodzenie i polskie tradycje |accessdate=September 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2008 }}</ref> The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses.

In some regions it is \u015awi\u0119ty Miko\u0142aj (Saint Nicholas), in others \u015awi\u0119ty Miko\u0142aj gives his gifts on December 6 and the giftbringer of the Christmas Eve is Gwiazdor (\"star man\"), Anio\u0142ek (\"little angel\") or Dzieci\u0105tko (\"baby Jesus\").\n\n===== Romania and Moldova =====\n{{main|Christmas in Romania}}\n\n[[File:Sibiu Christmas Market opening 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Christmas market in Sibiu, Romania]]\n\nChristmas (Romanian: ''Cr\u0103ciun'') in Romania is on December 25 and is generally considered the second most important religious [[Public holidays in Romania|Romanian holiday]] after Easter.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In Moldova, although Christmas is celebrated on December 25 like in Romania, January 7 is also recognized as an [[Public holidays in Moldova|official holiday]]. Celebrations begin with the decoration of the Christmas tree during daytime on December 24, and in the evening (Christmas Eve, in Romanian: Ajunul Cr\u0103ciunului) ''Mo\u015f Cr\u0103ciun'' (Father Christmas) delivers the presents.\n\nThe singing of carols is a very important part of Romanian Christmas festivities. On the first day of Christmas, many carolers walk through the streets of the towns and villages, holding a star made of cardboard and paper on which are depicted various scenes from the Bible. Romanian tradition has the smallest children going from house to house, singing carols and reciting poems and legends during the whole Christmas season. The leader of the group carries with him a star made of wood, covered with metal foil and decorated with bells and coloured ribbons. An image of the Nativity is painted on the star's centre, and this piece of handiwork is attached to the end of a broom or other long stick.\n\nRomanian food served during the holidays is a hearty multi-coursed meal, most of which consists of pork (organs, muscle, and fat). This is mainly a symbolic gesture for [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/recurs-la-romania/ignat-sarbatoare-insangerata-112680.html Ignat, s\u0103rb\u0103toare ins\u0103ngerat\u0103], December 22, 2007</ref>\n\n==== Eastern Europe ====\n\nSince the 1880s, the Christmas customs of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] countries have included a similar character known as ''[[Ded Moroz]]'' (\"Grandfather Frost\"). According to legend, he travels in a magical ''sanki'' \u2014 a decorated [[sleigh]] drawn by reindeer (or three white horses). With his young, blonde assistant ''[[Snegurochka]]'' (the \"Snow Maiden\", said to be his granddaughter) at his side, he visits homes and gives gifts to good children (not true for former Yugoslavian countries). He only delivers presents to children while they are asleep, and unlike Santa, he does not travel down chimneys, coming instead to the front door of children's homes. However, in Russia, children receive presents on [[New Year's Day]], Christmas is solely celebrated by Christians and on January 7.\n\nThis Ded Moroz (in Russia, ''Ded Moroz'') is not identified nor in any way associated with [[Saint Nicholas of Myra]] ([[feast day]], December 6), who is very widely revered in Eastern Europe for his clerical and charitable works as a bishop. In all likelihood, Ded Moroz is actually in Slavic tradition like Santa Claus, any connection to the original saint having long since disappeared.\n\n===== Georgia =====\n\n[[File:Alilo 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Children at the Alilo march in the streets of [[Tbilisi]]]]\n\nOn [[Public holidays in Georgia|calendars in Georgia]], Christmas ({{lang-ka|\u10e8\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0}}, ''shoba'') is celebrated on January 7 (December 25 on the Julian calendar). It is traditional in Georgia to go on [[Alilo]] (a modified pronunciation of Alleluia), a mass walk in the streets, dressed in special clothing to celebrate and congratulate each other. Most members of the Alilo march are children and they are given sweets by the adults. The Alilo carols vary across the [[mkhare|provinces]] of Georgia. In most songs these words are used: \"\u10dd\u10ea\u10d3\u10d0\u10ee\u10e3\u10d7\u10e1\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d4\u10d9\u10d4\u10db\u10d1\u10d4\u10e0\u10e1\u10d0, \u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4 \u10d8\u10e8\u10d5\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d4\u10d7\u10da\u10d4\u10db\u10e1\u10d0\u10dd'\" (''otsdakhutsa dekembersa qriste ishva betlemsao'') \u2013 \"on 25th December Christ was born in Bethlehem\". A local variant of the Christmas tree, called [[Chichilaki]], is made of soft wooden material with curled branches. Sometimes it is hazelnut branch which is carved into a [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]-like shape and decorated with fruits and sweets. The Western custom of a Christmas tree (''nadzvis khe'') is also popular and has been imported through Russia. The Georgian equivalent of \"Santa Claus\" is known as ''tovlis papa'' (or ''tovlis babua'' in western [[Georgian dialects]]), literally meaning a \"Grandfather snow\", and is traditionally portrayed with long white beard, dressed in national costume \"[[chokha]]\" and wearing a fur cloak \"nabadi\".\n\n===== Russia =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Russia}}\n\n[[File:Place pres de la gare Moscou.jpg|thumb|New Year decorations in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]]]\n\nAs in some other Eastern Orthodox countries, and due to the 13-day difference between the newer Gregorian Calender and the older Julian Calendars, Christmas is celebrated on January 7. Unlike its Western counterparts, Christmas is mainly a religious event in Russia. On Christmas Eve (January 6), there are several long services, including the [[Royal Hours]] and Vespers combined with the [[Divine Liturgy]]. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve \"[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Holy Supper]]\", which consists of 12 dishes, one to honor each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the \"\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f\" [[All Night Vigil]]. Then again, on Christmas Morning, for the \"\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f\u044f\" Divine Liturgy of the Nativity. Since 1992 Christmas has become a [[Public holidays in Russia|national holiday in Russia]], as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the officially atheist state. Christmas tree and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the [[October Revolution]]. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, the Christmas tradition was adopted as part of the secular [[New Year's Eve#Russia|New Year]] celebration. These include the decoration of a tree, or \"\u0451\u043b\u043a\u0430\" (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving \"Ded Moroz\" (\u0414\u0435\u0434 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 \"[[Grandfather Frost]]\") and his granddaughter, \"Snegurochka\" (\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \"[[The Snowmaiden]]\"). Many of these were brought to Russia by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] after his Western travels in the late 17th century. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===== Ukraine =====\n{{Main|Christmas in Ukraine}}\n\n[[File:Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper.jpg|thumb|right|Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, Ukraine]]\n\n''[[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Sviata Vecheria]]'' or \"Holy Supper\" is the central tradition of the Christmas Eve celebrations in Ukrainian homes and takes place in most parts of the country on January 6. In Western Ukraine, especially in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], due to historical multi-culturism, Christmas can be observed twice\u2014on December 25 and January 7, often irrespective of whether the family belongs to [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], the (Roman) Catholic Church, one of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (disambiguation)|Ukrainian Orthodox Churches]], or one of the Protestant denominations. The Western Ukrainian tradition of two Christmas celebrations, since 2017, are also celebrated nationwide as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.digitaljournal.com/news/world/ukraine-seeks-distance-from-moscow-with-new-christmas-holiday/article/507753|title=Ukraine seeks distance from Moscow with new Christmas holiday|website=m.digitaljournal.com|access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|uk}} {{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-42008437|title=\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 25 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c|date=November 16, 2017|work=BBC \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430|access-date=November 16, 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nWhen the children see the first star in the eastern evening sky, which symbolizes the trek of the Three Wise Men, the Sviata Vechera may begin. In farming communities the head of the household now brings in a sheaf of wheat called the didukh which represents the importance of the ancient and rich wheat crops of Ukraine, the staff of life through the centuries. Didukh means literally \"grandfather spirit\" so it symbolizes the family's ancestors. In city homes a few stalks of golden wheat in a vase are often used to decorate the table. The dinner table sometimes has a few wisps of hay on the embroidered table cloth as a reminder of the manger in Bethlehem. A prayer is said and the father says the traditional Christmas greeting, \"Chrystos rodyvsya!\" which is translated to \"Christ is born!\", which is answered by the family with \"Slavite Yoho!\" which means \"Let us glorify him!\". In some families the Old Slavic form \"\u0421hrystos rozhdayetsya!\" is used. At the end of the Sviata Vechera the family often sings Ukrainian Christmas Carols. In many communities the old Ukrainian tradition of caroling is carried on by groups of young people and members of organizations and churches calling at homes and collecting donations.\n\nTraditionally, Christmas Day opens for Ukrainian families with attendance in church services (Mass, worship service or Divine Liturgy). Ukrainian churches offer services starting before midnight on Christmas Eve and on Christmas morning. Christmas supper, without Lenten restrictions, does not have as many traditions connected with it as Sviata Vechera. The old tradition in Ukraine of giving gifts to children on St. Nicholas Day, December 19, has generally been replaced by the Christmas date and it is the Father Frost who visits all the children in a sleigh pulled by only three reindeer. (In Western Ukraine the St. Nicholas Day is marked there on December 6.)\n\n==== Northern Europe ====\n{{Essay-like|section|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn much of Northern Europe Christmas is celebrated on December 24 and is referred to as ''Jul'' (see [[Yule]]), while December 25 is a relaxed day for visiting relatives. \"Yule\" may come from the Norse word hweol, j\u00f3l, meaning wheel, and [[Old English]] [[g\u00e9ol]]. The Norse believed that the sun was a great wheel of fire that rolled towards and then away from the earth.\n\n===== Denmark =====\n{{Main|Jul (Denmark)}}\n\n[[File:Julemiddag.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Traditional [[Danish people|Danish]] Christmas dinner]]\n\nDanes celebrate on December 24, which is referred to as ''Juleaften'' (literally \"Yule evening\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/denmark.htm|title=Traditions in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915005111/http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/denmark.htm|archive-date=September 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> An evening meal with the family consists of either roast pork, roast duck or roast goose and eaten with potatoes, plenty of gravy, and red cabbage or finely chopped kale boiled in butter. Also caramelized potatoes is an important part of the Dane's Christmas dinner. For dessert rice pudding is traditionally served \u2013 composed largely of whipped cream and accompanied by lashings of black cherry sauce. The rice pudding also contains chopped peeled almonds, and a single whole peeled almond. Whoever finds the whole almond will have good luck for the coming year, and the lucky finder is entitled to a small gift, ''Mandelgave''.\nAfter the meal is complete, the family gathers around the Christmas tree and sings Christmas songs and hymns while holding hands and dancing in circles, and may even tour the house, still holding hands and singing. When the singing is complete, traditions vary. In some traditions, the family will select one child to hand out the presents. All children take turns handing out presents in other traditions.\nAlternatively \"Santa Claus\", the [[Julemanden]], will appear at the door in full costume with a large sack of presents over his shoulder. He will then distribute the presents, with the assistance of any children present, to their recipients. He should be offered suitable drink to keep him warm and cheerful on his onward journey, but do not expect loquacity \u2013 utterances are normally limited to loud and hearty laughs. Meanwhile, the presents are opened and this is followed by more snacks, candy, chips and, sometimes, a traditional Christmas drink called ''[[Gl\u00f8gg]].''\n\nThe Danish are somewhat famous for their ''Julefrokost,'' literally meaning \"Christmas lunch\", which includes various traditional Danish dishes, potentially accompanied by beer and [[Snaps]]. These Julefrokoster are popular and held within families, as well as by companies and other social groups. They would traditionally have taken place leading up to Christmas, but due to time constraints and stress during the Christmas month they are nowadays commonly held during November and January as well. The family Julefrokoster however are normally held on Christmas Day and/or The Second day of Christmas (December 26).\n\n[[File:Adventkalender andrea.JPG|thumb|[[Advent calendar]]]]\n\nAnother more recent Danish tradition is the concept of television ''Julekalendere'', special Christmas-themed, advent calendar-type television programmes with a daily episode shown on each of the first 24&nbsp;days of December, thus culminating on ''Juleaften''. Several television stations produce their own, most, but not all of which are targeted at child viewers. Some of the television advent calendars become extremely popular and go on to be reprised in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/denmark.shtml|title=Christmas in Denmark|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Denmark, Santa Claus is known as [[Julemanden]] (literally \"the Yule Man\") and is said to arrive in a sleigh drawn by reindeer, with presents for the children. He is assisted with his Yuletide chores by elves known as julenisser (or simply nisser), who are traditionally believed to live in attics, barns or similar places. In some traditions, to maintain the favour and protection of these nisser, children leave out saucers of milk or rice pudding or other treats for them and are delighted to find the food gone on Christmas morning.\n\n===== Estonia =====\n\n[[File:J\u00f5uluvanade XIII konverents.IMG 6103 by Ave Maria M\u00f5istlik.JPG|thumb|left|Christmas Santas]]\n\nIn the weeks preceding Christmas or ''j\u00f5ulud'', children place a slipper in their windows and receive a piece of candy or some other sweets from visiting elves (''p\u00e4kapikud''). Estonians celebrate Christmas on December 24, which is referred to as ''j\u00f5ululaup\u00e4ev'' (\"Christmas Saturday\"){{clarify|reason=Of course this day does not always fall on a Saturday|date=January 2011}} and is by act of Parliament a [[Public holidays in Estonia|public holiday in Estonia]]. Each year on this day, the President of Estonia declares the Christmas Peace and attends a Christmas service. The tradition was initiated by the order of [[Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] of Sweden in the 17th century. Estonian children are visited by ''[[j\u00f5uluvana]]'' (\"Santa Claus\") on Christmas Eve, and must sing songs or recite Christmas poems before receiving their gifts.\n\nThe evening meal typically includes pork with sauerkraut or Estonian sauerkraut with pork and barley (''mulgikapsad''), baked potatoes, white and blood sausage, potato salad with red beet, and p\u00e2t\u00e9. For dessert, Estonians eat gingerbread (''piparkoogid'') and marzipan. The most highly regarded drinks during this time have been beer and mulled wine or ''[[gl\u00f6gi]]'' and ''h\u00f5\u00f5gvein'' (\"glowing wine\"). Estonians leave the leftover food from Christmas dinner on the table overnight, in hopes that the spirits of family, friends, and loved ones will visit and also have something to eat. It is also customary to visit graveyards and leave candles for the deceased.\n\nDecember 25 or ''j\u00f5ulup\u00fcha'' is a relaxed day for visiting relatives.\n\n===== Finland =====\n{{main|Christmas in Finland}}\n[[File:Christmas presents and a tree.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas presents and a tree in Finland]]\n[[File:Joulukinkku.jpg|thumbnail|Christmas ham]]\n\nChristmas is an extensively prepared celebration centering on the family and home, although it has a religious dimension also. The Christmas season starts from December or even in late November, when shops began advertising potential Christmas gifts. Christmas decorations and songs become more prominent as Christmas nears, and children count days to Christmas with [[Advent calendar]]s. Schools and some other places have the day before Christmas Eve (''aatonaatto'', December 23) as a holiday, but at the latest on the Christmas Eve (''jouluaatto'', December 24), shops close early and stay closed until December 26. The main Christmas festivities are held on Christmas Eve on December 24, while Christmas Day (''joulup\u00e4iv\u00e4'') and the following day (''Tapaninp\u00e4iv\u00e4'', \"St. Stephen's Day\") are mandatory [[public holidays in Finland]]<ref name=\"Christmas in Finland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/finland.shtml|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Schools continue holidays up to the New Year.\n\nThe Declaration of [[Christmas Peace]] has been a tradition in Finland from [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] every year, except in 1939 due to the [[Winter War]]. It is a custom in many towns and cities. The most famous one of these declarations is on the Old Great Square of [[Turku]], the former capital of Finland, at noon on Christmas Eve. It is broadcast on Finnish radio (since 1935) and television, and nowadays also in some foreign countries. The declaration ceremony begins with the hymn ''Jumala ompi linnamme'' ([[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]'') by a band of the [[Finnish Navy]] and a male choir and continues with the Declaration of Christmas Peace read from a parchment roll, in both Finnish and Swedish, the country's two official languages:\n\n: Tomorrow, God willing, is the most gracious feast of the birth of our Lord and Saviour, and therefore a general Christmas peace is hereby declared, and all persons are directed to observe this holiday with due reverence and otherwise quietly and peacefully to conduct themselves, for whosoever breaks this peace and disturbs the Christmas holiday by any unlawful or improper conduct shall be liable, under aggravating circumstances, to whatever penalty is prescribed by law and decree for each particular offence or misdemeanour. Finally, all citizens are wished a joyous Christmas holiday.\n\nThe ceremony ends with trumpets playing the Finnish [[national anthem]] ''[[Maamme]]'' and ''[[Bj\u00f6rneborgarnas marsch|Porilaisten marssi]]'', with the crowd usually singing when the band plays ''Maamme''. Recently, there is also a declaration of Christmas peace for forest animals in many cities and municipalities, so there is no hunting during Christmas.\n\n[[File:Hundreds of candles and a Christian Cross at a cemetery on Christmas eve.jpg|thumb|It is traditional in Finland to bring candles to the graves of loved ones on Christmas Eve and [[All Saints Day]].]]\n\nFinnish people clean their homes well before Christmas and prepare special treats for the festive season. A sheaf of grain, nuts and seeds are tied on a pole, which is placed in the garden for the birds to feed on. Spruce trees are cut or bought from a market and taken to homes on or a few days before Christmas Eve and are decorated. Candles are lit on the Christmas tree, which is traditionally decorated using apples and other fruit, candies, paper flags, cotton and tinsel, in addition to [[Christmas ornaments]] such as stars or baubles. Actual candles are no longer used, being replaced by incandescent or LED lamps. A star symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem is placed at the top of the tree. Just before the Christmas festivities begin, people usually take a Christmas [[sauna]]. The tradition is very old; unlike on normal days, when one would go to the sauna in the evening, on Christmas Eve it is done before sunset. This tradition is based on a pre-20th century belief that the spirits of the dead return and have a sauna at the usual sauna hours.<ref name=\"Christmas in Finland\"/>\n\nAfterwards, they dress up in clean clothes for the Christmas dinner or [[joulup\u00f6yt\u00e4]], which is usually served between 5pm and 7pm, or traditionally with the appearance of the first star in the sky. The most traditional dish of the Finnish Christmas dinner is probably [[Christmas Ham]], roast suckling pig or a roasted fresh ham, but some may prefer alternatives like turkey. Several sorts of [[casserole]]s, like rutabaga, carrot and potato casserole are traditional, and are almost always exclusively served on Christmas. Other traditional Christmas dishes include [[lutefisk|boiled codfish]] (soaked beforehand in a lye solution for a week to soften it) served snowy white and fluffy, pickled [[herring]] and vegetables. Prune jam pastries, plum or mixed fruit soup, rice porridge with cinnamon, sugar and cold milk, and sweets like chocolate are popular desserts. Christmas gifts are usually exchanged after Christmas Eve dinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=180237&contentlan=2&culture=en-US|title=Christmas in Finland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Children do not hang up stockings in Finland but ''[[Joulupukki]]'' visits the household, maybe with a ''[[tonttu]]'' to help him distribute the presents.\n\nChristmas Day services begin early at six in the morning and people visit families and reunions are arranged on this day.\n\nBoxing Day, or ''tapaninp\u00e4iv\u00e4'' ([[St. Stephen]]'s Day) is traditionally set aside for driving around the village (''tapaninajot''), to counterbalance the solemn and family-oriented part of Christmas.\n\n===== Iceland =====\n{{Main|J\u00f3l (Iceland)}}\n\nThe Christmas or [[Yule]] ([[J\u00f3l (Iceland)|J\u00f3l]] in Icelandic)<ref name=\"Christmas in Iceland\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/iceland.shtml|title=Christmas in Iceland|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> celebration in Iceland starts four Sundays before Christmas proper, which begins on December 24 (Advent) and ends thirteen days later on January 6.

The religiously observant and/or traditional Icelanders will attend mass at this time while the secular Icelanders will begin their holiday meal immediately. After the meal is finished, they open gifts and spend the evening together. In Iceland people over the [[Icelandic cuisine#Christmas dishes|Yule holidays most often eat]] smoked lamb, ptarmigan and turkey. Pork is also very popular.\n\nThirteen days before December 24 the [[Yule Lads]] children will leave their shoes by the window so that the Yule Lads can leave small gifts in their shoes.<ref name=\"Christmas in Iceland\"/> The Yule Lads are the sons of two trolls living in the Icelandic mountains. Each of the Yule Lads is known for a different kind of mischief (for example slamming doors, stealing meat, stealing milk or eating the candles). The Yule Lads traditionally wear early Icelandic wool clothing but are now known for the more recognizable red and white suit.\n\nEach home typically sets up a Christmas tree indoors in the living room with most decorating it on December 11. In addition to the decorations, presents are put underneath the tree. It is also a tradition in many homes to boil skate on the 23rd. The day is called Saint Thorlak Mass (\u00deorl\u00e1ksmessa).\n\nDuring the holiday season, it is traditional for families to work together to bake small cookies to serve or give to guests. Most common are thin gingerbread cookies which are decorated in many different colors of glaze. Many families also follow the tradition of making Laufabrau\u00f0 (Leafbread), which is a flat thin bread that is cut out using a special tool and folding technique.\n\nThe end of year is divided between two days \u2013 the Old Year's Day (Gaml\u00e1rsdagur) and the New Year's Day (N\u00fd\u00e1rsdagur).

Church bells chime in the Christmas holiday between 17:00 and 18:00. In some families, the Christmas story from Luke 2 will be read from the old family Bible. The main Christmas meal is served in the evening. Common main dishes include pork rib, \"[[pinnekj\u00f8tt]]\" (pieces of lamb rib steamed on a grid of birch wood). Many people also eat \"[[lutefisk]]\" or fresh, poached cod. Rice porridge is also popular (but most commonly served as an early lunch rather than for the main Christmas dinner), an almond is often hidden in the porridge, and the person who finds it wins a treat or small gift. In some parts of Norway it is common to place porridge outside (in a barn, outhouse or even in the forest) to please \"Nissen\". In many families, where the parents grew up with different traditions, two different main dishes are served to please everyone. If children are present (and they have behaved well the last year), \"Julenissen\" (Santa Claus) pays a visit, otherwise gifts are stored under the Christmas tree.<ref name=\"Christmas in Norway\"/>\n\nFor a lot of Norwegians, especially families, television is an important part of the earlier hours of Christmas Eve. Many Norwegians do not feel the Christmas spirit until they have watched the Czech-German fairy tale ''[[T\u0159i o\u0159\u00ed\u0161ky pro Popelku|Three Nuts for Cinderella]]'' (Norwegian title: ''Tre n\u00f8tter til Askepott''), the Disney Christmas cavalcade ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/xmas-disney.html|title=Christmas in Norway fairytale|author=TVparty|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> the Norwegian fairytale movie ''Reisen til Julestjernen'' or the comedy sketch ''[[Dinner for One]]''. Attending one of the many stage productions of ''[[Putti Plutti Pott and Santa's Beard]]'' is also a very popular tradition.\n\nDecember 25 is a very quiet and relaxed day. Church services are well attended. The old tradition of a very early morning service before breakfast has been replaced in most areas by a service in the later morning. Afterward, many families get together for a large festive meal.<ref name=\"Christmas in Norway\"/>\n\nDecember 26 is also a day of many festivities. Cinemas, night clubs and bars are full, and there are lots of private gatherings and parties, where all kinds of traditional [[Christmas cookies]] and sweets are enjoyed. Fatty, tasty dinners are also part of it. The time between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve is called [[:wikt:romjul|romjul]]. During this time children in some parts of Norway dress up as \"nisser\" and \"Julebukk\" \u2013 \"Christmas goat\" \u2013 in their neighbourhoods and sing Christmas carols to receive treats, much the same way as in the American [[Halloween]]. January 6 (the 13th day of Christmas) is commonly regarded as the end of Christmas, while some end Christmas on the 20th day, and some even at Candlemas.\n\n===== Sweden =====\n{{Main|Jul (Sweden)}}\n\n[[File:Privat julbord.JPG|thumb|Traditional [[julbord]], or Christmas table]]\n[[File:Lucia-13.12.06.jpg|thumb|Saint Lucy's Day 2006]]\n[[File:Stortorgsbrunnen 2009.jpg|thumb|Christmas market with Christmas tree in [[Stockholm]]]]\n[[File:Christmas-Goat.JPG|thumb|Julbock, a giant Christmas goat at the [[G\u00e4vle]] town market, Sweden]]\n\nThe pre-Christian holiday of [[Yule]], or ''j\u00f3l'', was the most important holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe.<ref name=\"Christmas in Sweden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/sweden.shtml|title=Christmas in Sweden|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Originally the observance of the [[winter solstice]], and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the [[Advent]] and [[Christmas]] celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark. Swedish Christmas celebrations begin with the first of [[Advent]]. [[Saint Lucy's Day]] (locally known as ''Luciadagen'') is the first major Christmas celebration before Christmas itself. The eldest daughter arising early and wearing her Lucy garb of white robe, red sash, and a wire crown covered with whortleberry-twigs with nine lighted candles fastened in it awakens the family, singing \"Santa Lucia\", serving them coffee and [[saffron bun]]s ([[St. Lucia buns]]), thus ushering in the Christmas season.<ref name=Matthews>{{cite web|url=http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|title=Matthews, Jeff. \"Everybody Loves Lucy\", University of Maryland University College \u2013 Italian Studies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903152016/http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Lucy.html|archivedate=September 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSchools elect students to play the part of Lucia and her maids, and a national Lucia is elected on national television from regional winners. The regional Lucias will visit shopping malls, old people's homes and churches, singing and handing out ''pepparkakor'' [[gingerbread]] cookies.\n\nBoys take part in the procession as well, playing different roles associated with Christmas. Some may be dressed in the same kind of white robe, but with a cone-shaped hat decorated with golden stars, called ''stj\u00e4rngossar'' (star boys); some may be dressed up as \"[[tomte]]nissar\", carrying lanterns; and some may be dressed up as [[gingerbread man|gingerbread men]]. They participate in the singing and also have a song or two of their own, usually ''Staffan Stalledr\u00e4ng'', which tells the story about [[Saint Stephen]], the first Christian [[martyr]], caring for his five horses.\nElectric candles and glowing stars are placed in almost every window in the month of December in Sweden. Although December 25 (''juldagen'') is a [[Public holidays in Sweden|Swedish public holiday]], December 24 is the day when Santa Claus ''Jultomte'' (or simply ''[[Tomte]]'') brings the presents. Although not a public holiday, Christmas Eve is a ''de facto'' holiday in the sense that most workplaces are closed, and those who work, for instance in shops or care homes, get extra wages as a compensation. (''See also: [[Public holidays in Sweden]] for further explanation of this concept.'')\n\nThe Jultomte was originally a small invisible Christmas house gnome or dwarf from the Nordic mythology, who watched over the house and its inhabitants. An old superstition still calls for feeding the Tomte on Christmas Eve with a small bowl of porridge. If a bowl of porridge is not laid out for him somewhere in or outside the house, he will bring bad luck to everyone in the house the next year. The modern \"Tomten\", nowadays is a version of Santa Claus in red cloth and white beard, except that he doesn't enter the house through the chimney, but knocks on the door and asks \"finns det n\u00e5gra sn\u00e4lla barn h\u00e4r?\" (\"are there any nice children here?\")\n\nChristmas is, as everywhere else, an occasion celebrated with food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm|title=Traditions in Sweden|accessdate=September 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627150923/http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm|archive-date=June 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Almost all Swedish families celebrate on December 24 with a Christmas table, called Christmas [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]] (''[[julbord]]''), a display of several Christmas food items. Almost all julbord has Christmas ham, (''[[julskinka]]'') accompanied by other Christmas dishes, such as small [[wikt:meatball|meatball]]s, [[pickled herring]], [[spareribs]], small hot dogs, [[lutfisk]], pork sausage, salmon, [[Janssons frestelse]] (potato casserole with anchovy), and [[rice pudding]]. The Christmas julbord is served with [[julmust]] and beverage like mulled wine, Christmas beer or [[snaps]]. A Scandinavian speciality is the ''[[glogg|gl\u00f6gg]]'' (mulled and spiced wine with almonds and raisins), which is served hot in small cups. The different dishes of the julbord may vary throughout Sweden, from South to North. Businesses traditionally invite their employees to a julbord dinner or lunch the weeks before Christmas, and people go out privately to restaurants which also customarily offer julbord during December.\n\nExamples of candies and treats associated with Christmas are [[marzipan]], toffee, [[kn\u00e4ck]] (quite similar to butterscotch), nuts and fruits: figs, chocolate, dates and oranges decorated with cloves.\n\nTelevision also plays a big role, many families watch the Disney Christmas special ''Kalle Anka och hans v\u00e4nner \u00f6nskar God Jul''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> (''[[From All of Us to All of You]]''),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0908282/|title=From All of Us to All of You|work=IMDb|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton]]'' (animated short), or a re-run of the ''[[Svensson, Svensson]]'' episode ''God Jul!''

If one has two families to celebrate Christmas with, it is common that one of the families move their celebrations to Christmas Day or the day before Christmas Eve (commonly referred to as ''little Christmas Eve'').\n\nAfter December 24, the Christmas celebrations have more or less come to an end. Some people attend the [[julottan]], an early morning church service on December 25. This particular service was the main service of Christmas historically\u2014nowadays, the [[Midnight Mass]] has become increasingly popular. Others attend a simpler service called ''Christmas Prayer'' in the afternoon of Christmas Eve; however, many Swedes do not attend church at all during Christmas as the country is very [[secular]]. Even so, most families do set up a ''Julkrubba'' (''[[Nativity scene|Christmas Crib]]''). On January 13 (locally known as ''knutdagen'' or ''tjugondag knut'', English = twentiethday Christmas), 20&nbsp;days after Christmas, the Christmas celebrations come to an end and all Christmas decorations are removed.<ref name=\"Christmas in Sweden\"/>\n\n==== Southern Europe ====\n\n===== Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia =====\n\n[[File:Bozicna psenica.jpg|thumb|upright|Croatian wheat grass, planted on St. Lucy's, used for Christmas candles]]\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, Christmas (Croatian: ''Bo\u017ei\u0107'', Slovene: ''Bo\u017ei\u010d'') is celebrated mainly as a religious holiday. The festivities begin on [[Saint Nicholas]]'s Day on December 6 (in Slovenia) or [[St. Lucy]]'s on December 13 depending on what region (in Croatia). St. Lucy or St. Nicholas brings children presents, and St. Nicholas is said to be accompanied by [[Krampus]] who steals away the presents of bad children. This \"anti-Santa\" is said to have one cloven hoof, a handful of heavy chains, and a sack on his back to collect naughty children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardstore.com/christmas-around-the-world |title=How is Christmas Celebrated Around the World |work=CardStore.com |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref> In Croatia on St. Lucy's, families will plant wheat seeds in a bowl of shallow water, which will grow several inches by Christmas and are then tied together with a red, blue and white ribbon called ''trobojnica'.\n\nOn Christmas Eve (Croatian: ''Badnjak'', Slovene: ''Sveti ve\u010der'' (holy eve)), three candles representing the [[Trinity]] are lit and placed in the middle of the wheat, the glow symbolizes the soul of each person. On this day, the tree is decorated, the home is decked with greenery and the women already beginning to prepare the Christmas meal. They also bake special types of bread: one is round inscribed with a cross on top known as the ''cesnica'', another is made with honey, nuts and dried fruit called the Christmas Eve Bread (Croatian: ''Badnji Kruh'', Slovene: ''Bo\u017ei\u010dni kruh''). In many villages, straw (which symbolizes Christ's birth in the manger) is spread around the floors of the home for the Christmas Eve dinner. As is customary with Catholic people, meat is not consumed in Croatia, while in Slovenia it is. Instead of meat in Croatia and with other food in Slovenia, salad and fish is served, many choosing to eat the [[Dalmatia]]n specialty ''bakalar'', dried cod fish. The family then sprinkle holy water on their [[Yule log]] (''badnjak'') which they light and watch. In villages, the badnjak is freshly cut that very morning by the father of the household while reciting traditional prayers. At the end of the meal, a piece of the ''cesnica'' is cut and dipped in wine and used to sprinkle on the candles to extinguish them, while reciting the [[Trinitarian formula]] (\"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen\").\n\nMany families will go to a midnight mass on Christmas Eve and often another on Christmas Day. It is common for Christmas presents to be placed under the tree, to suggest that the Angel or the Baby Jesus (''Mali Isus'') leaves them there while others are attending midnight mass. Presents are opened after the mass. Christmas is a day of celebrating with family; a large feast is prepared and traditional foods such as stuffed cabbage, turkey, pot roast, pita and smoked meat are served, along with various desserts such as [[fritule]], [[potica]] (especially in Slovenia), [[strudel]], and cookies.\n\nSlovenes are also visited by another one of their ''trije dobri mo\u017eje'' (three good guys), who bring presents in December: Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus and Dedek Mraz (\"Grandfather Frost\"). Families mostly celebrate New Year's Eve at home with extended family members, friends, and sometimes neighbours. Women prepare [[sarma (food)|cabbage sarma]], which they will eat on January 1 to symbolize good fortune, and [[steak tartare]], which they eat on New Year's Eve on toast with butter. At midnight, people go outdoors to watch fireworks, while Dedek Mraz leaves presents under the tree. Epiphany on January 6 marks the end of the Christmas season.\n\n===== Bulgaria =====\n\n[[File:Sofia TZUM night.JPG|thumb|left|TZUM department store at Christmastime, [[Sofia]], Bulgaria]]\n\nIn Bulgaria, Christmas ({{lang-bg|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430}}, ''[[Koleda]]'' or more formally \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e, ''Rozhdestvo Hristovo'', \"Nativity of Jesus\") is celebrated on December 25 and is preceded by Christmas Eve (\u0411\u044a\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440, ''Badni vecher''). Traditionally, Christmas Eve would be the climax of the [[Nativity Fast]], and thus only an odd number of lenten dishes are presented on that evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/bulgarianchristmas.htm|title=Bulgarian Christmas|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> The table is usually not cleared after the dinner and until the next morning, to leave some food for the holy spirits \u2013 a custom which probably comes from pagan pre-Christian times. On that day, a [[Bulgarian budnik]] is set alight.

Another custom is the baking of a traditional round loaf (\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430, ''[[pita]]''). The pita is broken into pieces by the head of the family and a piece is given to each family member, a valuable possession, and a piece for God. A coin is hidden inside the pita and whoever gets the coin, he or she will have luck, health, and prosperity in the coming year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indobase.com/holidays/christmas/world/christmas-in-bulgaria.html|title=Christmas in bulgaria|publisher=Indobase|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nAs in other countries, a Christmas tree is typically set up and the entire house is decorated. The local name of Santa Claus is Dyado Koleda (\u0414\u044f\u0434\u043e \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430, \"Grandfather Christmas\"), with Dyado Mraz (\u0414\u044f\u0434\u043e \u041c\u0440\u0430\u0437, \"Grandfather Frost\") being a similar Russian-imported character lacking the Christian connotations and thus popular during the Communist rule.

Most families set up Christmas trees and shops have decorations and lights. Presents are placed under the Christmas tree and are opened on January 1, St Basil's Day. In Greek tradition, [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil's (of Caesarea)]] name was given to Father Christmas and is supposed to visit children and give presents on January 1 (when Basil's memory is celebrated), unlike other European traditions, where this person is Saint Nicholas and comes every Christmas. Carol singing is another tradition on Christmas and New Year's Eve. The Christmas meal usually includes lamb or pork and desserts such as [[kourabies]] (\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2) and [[melomakarona]] (\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1).

Christmas morning after church there is the practice to become the \"pork batches,\" served with wine to open the appetite, and \"thick,\" done by Eve, which is boiled pork with plenty of lemon that is left to clot overnight. The pork-food is in the hallmark of Greek Christmas. In many Greek cities and ports like [[Thessaloniki]], [[Volos]], [[Patras|Patra]], the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek Islands]] etc., it is decorated the traditional Christmas boat. And in many central squares of the country a big Christmas tree, where  many of the Christmas festivals take place.\n\nSome of the Christmas Festivals in Greece are \"\u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\" ''Rugatsari\u03b1'', where all the residents of the city of [[Kastoria]] are delivered in a separate [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] revelry, with the accompaniment of folk melodies bodies all traditional musical sounds of the area. This ancient habit, whose origin is lost in time.\nIn [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] there are beliefs about demonic and other supernatural beings, who come from the Twelve Days of Christ as the Epiphany.

Christmas lunch usually consists of turkey served with potatoes and vegetables (Malta is a former [[British colony]]). The island has adopted other popular secular customs and traditions such as the Christmas tree and Father Christmas.\n\nPresents are normally generally exchanged either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day. A local seasonal food is the \"Qaghaq ta' l-Ghasel\" (Honey Ring). These Maltese Christmas sweets are eaten as a dessert during the Christmas season but can also be purchased all year round. Christmas cribs are a popular and are seen in most homes.\n\nAnother Christmas tradition is the planting of [[common vetch]] seeds in flat-bottomed pots. They are planted around the beginning of December, normally placed on white cotton and watered every day whilst being kept in the dark all the time. They are usually taken out just before Christmas, and resemble long white spaghetti-like strands of leaves (since they would have grown in the dark).\n\n===== Portugal =====\n\n[[File:Christmas decorations in Braga (6).JPG|thumb|Christmas decorations in Braga]]\n\nChristmas, an [[Public holidays in Portugal|official holiday in Portugal]], is widely celebrated and is associated with family gatherings. People who have moved to the main cities, like [[Lisbon]] or [[Porto]], or even those who have emigrated to other countries, still travel to their home towns and villages to spend Christmas Eve with their families. After the ''Missa do galo'' (Rooster's Mass) that celebrates the birth of Christ, families gather around the ''Consoada'', the late supper held on Christmas Eve. The traditional dish is ''bacalhau com todos'' (dried codfish boiled with vegetables), although, in northern Portugal, the bacalhau is often replaced by octopus. The Christmas dinner usually ends with ''fatias douradas'' (golden slices), ''filhoses'' and ''sonhos'' (dreams), all desserts based on fried flour or fried bread. Another traditional cake is the ''Bolo Rei'' ([[Bolo Rei|king cake]]) served on Epiphany. Nowadays, although Santa Claus (''Pai Natal'') is more popular, in some regions people still believe that it is the ''Menino Jesus'' (Baby Jesus) who brings presents to children.\n\n===== Serbia and Montenegro=====\n\n[[File:Christmas-Serbian Ortodox \u010cesnica.jpg|thumb|Serbian Orthodox Christmas bread]]\n\n{{Main|Serbian Christmas traditions|Badnjak (Serbian)}}\n\nIn Serbia and Montenegro, Christmas ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b, ''Bo\u017ei\u0107'' or more formally \u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e, Rozhdestvo Hristovo, \"Nativity of Christ\") is celebrated for three consecutive days, beginning with Christmas Day. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] uses the traditional Julian calendar, per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls on January 7. This day is called the first day of Christmas, and the following two are accordingly called the second, and the third day of Christmas. During this festive time, one is to greet another person with \"Christ is Born,\" which should be responded to with \"Truly He is Born.\" The [[Serbian language|Serbian]] name for Christmas is ''Bo\u017ei\u0107'' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u045b, {{IPA-sh|bo\u0292it\u0255|pron}}), which means the young or little God.\n\nThis holiday surpasses all the others celebrated by [[Serbs]], with respect to the diversity of applied folk customs and rituals. These may vary from region to region, some of them having modern versions adapted to the contemporary way of living. The ideal environment to carry them out fully is the traditional multi-generation country household.\n\nIn the morning of Christmas Eve a young, straight oak tree is selected and felled by the head of the household. A log is cut from it and is referred to as the [[Badnjak (Serbian)|badnjak]]. In the evening, the badnjak is ceremoniously put on the domestic fire that burns on the house's fireplace called ''ognji\u0161te'', whose hearth is without a vertical surround. The burning of the ''badnjak'' is accompanied by prayers to God so that the coming year may bring much happiness, love, luck, riches, and food. Since most houses today have no ''ognji\u0161te'' on which to burn a ''badnjak'', it is symbolically represented by several leaved oak twigs. For the convenience of people who live in towns and cities, they can be bought at marketplaces or received in churches.\n\nThe dinner on this day is festive, copious and diverse in foods, although it is prepared in accordance with the rules of fasting. Groups of young people go from house to house of their village or neighbourhood, congratulating each other, singing, and making performances; this continues through the next three days. The Serbs also take a bundle of straw into the house and spread it over the floor, and then put walnuts on it. Before the table is served for the Christmas Eve dinner, it is strewn with a thin layer of straw and covered with a white cloth. The head of household makes the [[Sign of the Cross]], lights a candle, and [[Censer|cense]]s the whole house. The family members sit down at the table, but before tucking in they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they together sing the [[Troparion]] of the Nativity.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Hymns of the Feast\n| url = http://www.goarch.org/special/listen_learn_share/nativity\n| work = Feast of the Nativity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\n| publisher = [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]\n| year = 2009}}</ref>\nAfter the dinner young people visit their friends, a group of whom may gather at the house of one of them. Christmas and other songs are sung, while the elderly narrate stories from the olden times.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the celebration is announced at dawn by church bells and by shooting. A big importance is given to the first visit a family receives that day. People expect that it will summon prosperity and well-being for their household in the ensuing year; this visit is often pre-arranged. Christmas dinner is the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. A special, festive loaf of bread is baked for this occasion. The main course is roast pork of a pig which they cook whole by rotating it impaled on a wooden spit close to an open fire. Even though gift-giving is not necessarily a part of the tradition, a [[Santa Claus]] inspired character called Bo\u017ei\u0107 Bata (translated as Christmas friend) sometimes takes his during gift giving, as Santa Claus is more traditionally connected to New Years celebrations. Gift-giving is, nevertheless, connected with the celebrations, being traditionally done on the three consecutive Sundays that immediately precede it. Children, women, and men, respectively, are the set gift-givers on these three days.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. The course of these celebrations can be typically divided into three parts: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of going and cutting down the tree to be used as the ''badnjak'', taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes [[Vespers]], placing the ''badnjak'' on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the ''badnjak'', and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the ''badnjak'' not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of getting together around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration, however, has its own specificities which reflect traditions of the local community, and other local factors.\n\nIn Serbia, Montenegro and [[North Macedonia]] Christmas is celebrated on January 7. This is a result of their [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches marking Christmas Day based on the [[Julian calendar]], which is now 13&nbsp;days behind the internationally used Gregorian calendar.\n\n===== Spain =====\n\n[[File:Spain.Barcelona.Porta.Angel.Navidad.jpg|thumb|Avinguda Portal de l'\u00c0ngel, at Christmas time, [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\nChristmas and St Stephen's Day are [[Public holidays in Spain|officially recognized holidays in Spain]]. In most of Spain, the Christmas period, referred to as \"Navidad\", lasts from Christmas Eve referred to as \"Nochebuena\" or \"the Good Night.\" on December 24 to Epiphany on January 6. Many homes and most churches display a [[Nativity scene]], a [[Christmas tree]], or both. The ''pesebre'' (nativity scene) is present in many homes, schools and stores. On the 26th, ''Sant Esteve'' (Saint Stephen) is celebrated with a family gathering.\n\nA large family dinner is celebrated on Christmas Eve (Nochebuena) and can last until 6&nbsp;o'clock in the morning. There is a wide variety of typical foods one might find on plates across Spain on this particular night, and each [[Regional food|region]] has its own distinct specialities. It is particularly common, however, to start the meal with a seafood dish such as prawns or salmon, followed by a bowl of hot, homemade soup. The main meal will commonly consist of [[Lamb (food)|roast lamb]], or seafood, such as cod or shellfish. For dessert, there is quite a spread of delicacies, among them are [[turr\u00f3n]], a dessert made of honey, egg and almonds that is Arabic in origin. Special dishes and desserts include Mariscos y Pescado (shellfish and fish), [[marzipan]], Pavo Trufado de Navidad (turkey with [[truffles]]), and [[polvorones]] (shortbread made of almonds, flour and sugar).\n\nEven though there is still the traditional [[Misa del Gallo]] at midnight, few Spaniards continue to follow the old custom of attending.\n\nChildren usually receive one or two presents on Christmas Day (December 25), brought by \"Pap\u00e1 Noel\" (Father Noel), which is a non-traditional imitation of the American Santa Claus, but in some regions there are other more traditional characters, for example, the [[Olentzero]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. There is a special Christmas dance called the Jota which has been performed for centuries in Spain during Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santas.net/spanishchristmas.htm|title=Christmas Traditions in Spain|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn December 31 (Nochevieja) there is also a large family feast. Some young people go out in \"cotill\u00f3n\", a very big feast in bars and pubs and the drink and dance until January 1 morning, when they have [[Churros|churros with chocolate]] for breakfast. On January 5 a huge parade (La Cabalgata or [[cavalcade]]) welcomes the Three Kings to the city. Children put their shoes in the window on January 5 in the hope that the Three Wise Men will deliver them presents.<ref>''Christmas.'' World Book Encyclopedia 2003 edition. Volume Ch.

Children do not hang Christmas stockings but put their shoes by the fireplace or under the Christmas tree so ''P\u00e8re No\u00ebl'' (Father Christmas or Santa Claus) can give them gifts (a practice also among [[Romandy|French-speaking Switzerland]]). Some families also attend midnight mass and decorate their homes with Nativity Scenes depicting the birth of Jesus. Additional ''Santons'' (little saints) may be added in the nativity scenes.\n\nIn France and in other [[francophone|French-speaking]] areas (see French Canada), a long family dinner, called a ''[[r\u00e9veillon]]'', is held on Christmas Eve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |title=R\u00e9veillon |publisher=VirtualMuseum.ca |date=December 1, 1995 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010523234250/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Noel/angl/reveilon.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2001  }}</ref> The name of this dinner is based on the word ''r\u00e9veil'' (meaning \"waking\"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight and beyond. R\u00e9veillon is generally of an exceptional or luxurious nature. [[Appetizer]]s may include [[lobster]], [[oyster]]s, [[escargot]]s or [[foie gras]], etc. One traditional dish is [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] with [[chestnut]]s. R\u00e9veillons in [[Quebec]] will often include some variety of [[tourti\u00e8re]]. Dessert may consist of a ''[[b\u00fbche de No\u00ebl]]''. In [[Provence]], the tradition of the ''13 desserts'' is followed, almost invariably including: ''pompe \u00e0 l'huile'' (a flavoured bread), [[date (fruit)|date]]s, etc. Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] or similar [[sparkling wine]]s as a conclusion. Christmas carols may also be sung.\n\n===== United Kingdom =====\n\n[[File:Trafalgar Square Christmas Carols - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas Tree and carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London]]\nIn the United Kingdom Christmas decorations are put up in shops and town centres from early November. Many towns and cities have a public event involving a local or regional celebrity to mark the switching on of Christmas lights. Decorations in people's homes are commonly put up from early December, traditionally including a Christmas tree, cards, and lights both inside and outside the home. Every year, Norway donates a giant Christmas tree for the British to raise in Trafalgar Square as a thank you for helping during the [[Second World War]]. Christmas carolers at [[Trafalgar Square]] in London sing around the tree on various evenings up until Christmas Eve and Christmas decorations are traditionally left up until the evening of January 5 (the night before Epiphany); it is considered bad luck to have Christmas decorations up after this date. In practice, many Christmas traditions, such as the playing of Christmas music, largely stop after Christmas Day.<ref>{{cite web|website=Woodlands-Junior.Kent.sch.uk|url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|title=British Christmas: introduction, food, customs|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220220018/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/|archivedate=February 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Mince pie]]s are traditionally sold during the festive season and are a popular food for Christmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projectbritain.com/Xmas/dinner.html|title=Christmas dinner|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> It is common in many UK households for children and adults to put up advent calendars in their homes, which may either contain chocolates or Christmas scenes behind their doors.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nA common feature of the Christmas season is the Nativity play which is practiced in most primary and some secondary schools across the UK.

Many families tell their children stories about Father Christmas and his reindeer. One tradition is to put out a plate of carrots for the reindeer, and [[mince pie]]s and sherry for Father Christmas to help him on his way.\n\nThe majority of families open their presents on the morning of Christmas Day, the [[Royal family]] being a notable exception, as they open their gifts on Christmas Eve, following German tradition introduced by the [[Hanoverians]].

The gift-giving, public holidays and feasting associated with mid-winter were traditionally held between December 11 and January 6. However, since the 1980s, the fading of the Church's influence and the increased influences from the rest of the UK and elsewhere, Christmas and its related festivities are now nearly on a par with Hogmanay and \"[[New Year's Day|Ne'erday]]\".

Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day are public holidays, and many people do not return to work until after New Year's Day. Irish people spend more and more money each year on celebrating Christmas.

Many neighbours and friends attend each other's houses for Christmas drinks and parties on the days leading up to and after Christmas Day. Although religious devotion in Ireland today is considerably less than it used to be, there are huge attendances at religious services for Christmas Day, with Midnight Mass a popular choice. Most families arrange for their deceased relatives to be prayed for at these Masses as it is a time of remembering the dead in Ireland. It is traditional to decorate graves at Christmas with a wreath made of holly and ivy. Even in the most undevout of homes in Ireland the traditional crib takes centre stage along with the Christmas tree as part of the family's decorations. Some people light candles to signify symbolic hospitality for [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. Therefore, it is usual to see a white candle, or candle set, placed in several windows around people's homes. The candle was a way of saying there was room for [[Jesus]]'s parents in these homes even if there was none in [[Bethlehem]].<ref name=\"CID\">{{cite web |url=http://www.christmasindublin.com/traditions.html |title=Irish Christmas Traditions |publisher=ChristmasinDublin.com |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810083446/http://christmasindublin.com/Traditions.html |archivedate=August 10, 2003  }}</ref> It is traditional to leave a [[mince pie]] and a bottle or a glass of [[Guinness]] for [[Santa Claus]] along with a carrot for [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer|Rudolph]] on Christmas Eve.\n\nSanta Claus, often known in Ireland simply as Santy or ''Daid\u00ed na Nollag'' in [[Irish language|Irish]], brings presents to children in Ireland, which are opened on Christmas morning. Family and friends also give each other gifts at Christmas. The traditional Christmas dinner consists of turkey or goose and ham with a selection of vegetables and a variety of potatoes, as potatoes still act as a staple food in Ireland despite the popularisation of staples such as rice and pasta. Dessert is a very rich selection of Christmas pudding, Christmas cake, and mince pies with equally rich sauces such as brandy butter.\n\nChristmas celebrations in Ireland finish with the celebration of [[Little Christmas]] also known as O\u00edche Nollaig na mBan in Irish on January 6. This festival, which coincides with Epiphany, is also known as ''Women's Christmas'' in [[County Cork|Cork]] & [[County Kerry|Kerry]].\n\n===== Netherlands and Flanders =====\n\nChristmas traditions in the Netherlands<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/holland.shtml|title=Christmas in Holland / The Netherlands|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> are almost the same as the ones in Dutch speaking parts of Belgium (Flanders). The Dutch recognize two days of Christmas as public holidays in the Netherlands, calling December 25 Eerste Kerstdag (\"first Christmas day\") and December 26 Tweede Kerstdag (\"second Christmas day\"). In families, it is customary to spend these days with either side of the family.\n\nIn Catholic parts of the country, it used to be common to attend Christmas Eve midnight mass; this custom is upheld, but mostly by the elder generation and by fewer people every year. Christmas Eve is these days a rather normal evening without any special gatherings or meals. On Christmas Day, throughout both Flanders and the Netherlands elaborated meals are prepared by the host or together as a family. Also meals of which every participant / guest is preparing one dish are very common. Christmas decorations start appearing in stores right after [[Sinterklaas]]. The week before Christmas is important to the retail trade, because this is the biggest sales week in the country. Christmas songs are heard everywhere. The cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Eindhoven are the busiest cities in terms of entertainment on Christmas Day. Traditionally, people in the Netherlands and Flanders do not exchange gifts on Christmas, since this is already done during a separate holiday ([[Sinterklaas]]) a few weeks before Christmas. However, more and more people have in the 2000s and 2010s started to give presents on Christmas as well, possibly under the influence of commerce and that from other countries where Christmas is celebrated with lots of presents (notably the USA). In the north / eastern, the [[West Low German]] part of the Netherlands, some people will blow the [[Midwinter horn]]s from [[Advent]] until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n\nThe Christmas season wraps up after the new year with Epiphany, or \"Driekoningen\". On January 6 children especially in the north of the Netherlands dress up as the Three Wise Men and travel in groups of three carrying lanterns, re-enacting the Epiphany and singing traditional songs for their hosts. In return they are rewarded with cakes and sweets. This practice is less common south of the great rivers. In the south and east of the Netherlands it is common practice to burn the Christmas trees of the community on a big pile on January 6 to celebrate the end of Christmas and the start of the new year.\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\n==== Australia ====\n{{see also|Christmas in Australia}}\n[[File:Christmas Belles at Crown - 11366677816.jpg|thumb|The Christmas Belles performing at Melbourne Crown atrium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peninsulakids.com.au/christmas-city/|title=Melbourne Christmas city|work=Mornington Peninsula Kids|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weekendnotes.com/free-christmas-events-melbourne/|title=Christmas events Melbourne|publisher=|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>]]\nIn Australia, as with all of the Southern Hemisphere, Christmas occurs during the height of the summer season. Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 25\u201326) are recognized as [[Public holidays in Australia|national public holidays in Australia]], and workers are therefore entitled to a day off with pay.\n\nThe Australian traditions and decorations are quite similar to those of the United Kingdom and North America, and similar wintry iconography is commonplace. This means a red fur-coated Santa Claus riding a sleigh, carols such as \"Jingle Bells\", and various snow-covered Christmas scenes on Christmas cards and decorations appear in the middle of summer. There have also been depictions of Christmas traditions tailored to Australian iconography, such as Santa partaking in activities such as [[surfing]] (in 2015, a world record was set on [[Bondi Beach]] for the world's largest surf lesson, featuring 320 participants in Santa suits), parodies of traditional carols, and original songs such as [[Rolf Harris]]'s ''Six White Boomers'' (which depicts Santa Claus as using a [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] pulled by [[kangaroo]]s instead of reindeer and a sleigh).<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/surfing-santas-set-new-world-record-in-australia-a6775186.html|title=Surfing Santas set new world record in Australia|date=December 16, 2015|website=The Independent|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiantimes.co.uk/10-greatest-ever-australian-christmas-songs/|title=10 greatest ever Australian Christmas songs|date=December 13, 2018|website=Australian Times News|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/christine-anu-where-is-all-the-australian-christmas-music-20141223-12bxo7.html|title=Christine Anu: Where is all the Australian Christmas music?|last=Vincent|first=Peter|date=December 21, 2014|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nA notable Christmas event in Australia is ''[[Carols by Candlelight]]''\u2014an annual concert and charity appeal benefiting the charity [[Vision Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/m22tvmon-20181213-h193mq.html|title=Monday Picks: Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight, Donna Hay, and more|last=McManus|first=Bridget|date=December 22, 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/outer-east/christmas-2018-peter-casey-prepares-for-final-carols-by-candlelight/news-story/618dcbe188d6fcb4a2cb8557bb9b7572|title=Christmas 2018: Peter Casey prepares for final Carols By Candlelight|website=Herald Sun|access-date=December 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{see also|Christmas in New Zealand}}\n[[File:Pohutukawa flowers.JPG|thumb|upright=.7|The December-flowering [[Metrosideros excelsa|pohutukawa]] (''Metrosideros excelsa''), an often-used Christmas symbol in New Zealand]]\nChristmas Day and Boxing Day are both [[Public holidays in New Zealand|statutory holidays in New Zealand]].

They established their settlement in this once vast unknown land. As more Malay settlers arrived from distant lands, more settlements were founded until even the upland regions of the peninsula were settled. The inhabitants had their own form of village government. They were ruled by a headman, a ''datu'', or a sultan, in case of big encampments. Malay civilization began to take roots. Rapid increase of population brought about the settlements of all the neighboring regions, that it did not take long before several nearby regions were inhabited later on to comprise the whole province of Kumintang, better known later as Batangas.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial rule, the Calumpan Peninsula was made a part of the ''pueblo'' of [[Bauan]], in the province of Kumintang. The same peninsula territory of Bauan was subdivided into barrios: Mainaga, Pulong-Niogan, Pulong-Balibaguhan, Anilao, Solo, Pulong-Anahao, Bagalangit, Nag-Iba, Malimatoc, Saguing and Talaga. For more than three hundred years, while the Archipelago was under Spanish domination, the peninsula remained a part of the \u201cpueblo\u201d of Bauan even until the early part of the American occupation. The people of this peninsula, like other people of other regions, suffered untold hardships under the Spanish rule. The yoke of the Spanish tyranny was thrown off after the gallant uprising of 1896. The revolution emancipated the people from the tyrants of Spain. Foremost of the heroic young men was Don Francisco Castillo, known as Apian Kiko, who led the fight for freedom in this peninsula.\n\nAfter efforts had been exerted by the proponents of establishing a new municipality independent of the town of Bauan, eleven (11) barrios of the Calumpan Peninsula and the whole of the Maricaban Island was declared an independent municipality, with the name ''Mabini'', derived from the Philippine hero [[Apolinario Mabini]]. The new-born municipality of Mabini was inaugurated on January 1, 1918, with Captain Francisco Castillo, known as the founder of the town, as the first appointive Municipal President.<ref name=r1>[https://www.phlpost.gov.ph/stamp-releases.php?id=3833 CENTENNIAL OF MABINI, BATANGAS]. phlpost.gov.ph (February 20, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the {{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|area}} constituting {{percentage|{{PH wikidata|area}}|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13744}}|2|pad=yes}} of the {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13744}}|km2|2|adj=mid|}} total area of Batangas.\n\n==Barangays==\nMabini is politically subdivided into 34 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|nscb}} Barangay San Juan was formerly the sitios of Nag-ilong and Lugay in the barrio of Mainaga, constituted into a separate and independent barangay through ''[[Republic Act]] No. 212'', approved June 1, 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra212.html|title=An act creating the barrio of San Juan in the municipality of Mabini, province of Batangas|publisher=LawPH.com|date=|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n<!-- arranged by PSGC for easier updates in the future -->\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016001| Anilao Proper      |  650|  611}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016002| Anilao East        | 1626| 1566}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016003| Bagalangit         | 2458| 2613}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016004| Bulacan            | 1351| 1281}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016005| Calamias           | 1123| 1023}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016006| Estrella           |  716|  631}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016007| Gasang             | 2455| 2349}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016008| Laurel             | 1220| 1183}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016009| Ligaya             |  889| 1205}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016010| Mainaga            | 1951| 1735}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016011| Mainit             | 1076| 1050}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016012| Majuben            |  725|  640}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016014| Malimatoc I        |  955|  938}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016015| Malimatoc II       |  999| 1141}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016016| Nag{{nbhyph}}Iba   |  886|  904}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016017| Pilahan            |  765|  643}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016018| [[Poblacion]]      | 1911| 1472}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016019| Pulang Lupa        |  969| 1220}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016020| Pulong Anahao      | 1227| 1200}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016021| Pulong Balibaguhan |  940|  887}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016022| Pulong Niogan      | 1755| 1268}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016023| Saguing            | 1302| 1313}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016024| Sampaguita         | 1621| 1550}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016025| San Francisco      | 2052| 1762}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016026| San Jose           |  876|  865}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016027| San Juan           | 2124| 1975}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016028| San Teodoro        | 1913| 1783}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016029| Santa Ana          |  585|  712}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016030| Santa Mesa         | 1126| 1193}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016031| Santo Ni\u00f1o         |  678|  531}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016032| Santo Tomas        | 1210| 1136}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016033| Solo               | 2725| 2756}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016034| Talaga Proper      | 1636| 1571}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016035| Talaga East        | 1716| 1684}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom|44391}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Mabini\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = 11925\n| 1939 = 10259\n| 1948 = 11850\n| 1960 = 15548\n| 1970 = 19522\n| 1975 = 21694\n| 1980 = 23637\n| 1990 = 30474\n| 1995 = 33499\n| 2000 = 37474\n| 2007 = 40629\n| 2010 = 44391\n| 2015 = 46211\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, Mabini had a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}}.{{PH census|current}} The population density was {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2}}.\n\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mabini,Batangasjf8695 13.JPG|thumb|Mabini General Hospital]]\n[[Jeepney]]s and [[tricycle]]s are the main means of transportation around the town.

Rapid increase of population brought about the settlements of all the neighboring regions, that it did not take long before several nearby regions were inhabited later on to comprise the whole province of Kumintang, better known later as Batangas.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial rule, the Calumpan Peninsula was made a part of the ''pueblo'' of [[Bauan]], in the province of Kumintang. The same peninsula territory of Bauan was subdivided into barrios: Mainaga, Pulong-Niogan, Pulong-Balibaguhan, Anilao, Solo, Pulong-Anahao, Bagalangit, Nag-Iba, Malimatoc, Saguing and Talaga. For more than three hundred years, while the Archipelago was under Spanish domination, the peninsula remained a part of the \u201cpueblo\u201d of Bauan even until the early part of the American occupation. The people of this peninsula, like other people of other regions, suffered untold hardships under the Spanish rule. The yoke of the Spanish tyranny was thrown off after the gallant uprising of 1896. The revolution emancipated the people from the tyrants of Spain. Foremost of the heroic young men was Don Francisco Castillo, known as Apian Kiko, who led the fight for freedom in this peninsula.\n\nAfter efforts had been exerted by the proponents of establishing a new municipality independent of the town of Bauan, eleven (11) barrios of the Calumpan Peninsula and the whole of the Maricaban Island was declared an independent municipality, with the name ''Mabini'', derived from the Philippine hero [[Apolinario Mabini]]. The new-born municipality of Mabini was inaugurated on January 1, 1918, with Captain Francisco Castillo, known as the founder of the town, as the first appointive Municipal President.<ref name=r1>[https://www.phlpost.gov.ph/stamp-releases.php?id=3833 CENTENNIAL OF MABINI, BATANGAS]. phlpost.gov.ph (February 20, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the {{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|area}} constituting {{percentage|{{PH wikidata|area}}|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13744}}|2|pad=yes}} of the {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13744}}|km2|2|adj=mid|}} total area of Batangas.\n\n==Barangays==\nMabini is politically subdivided into 34 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|nscb}} Barangay San Juan was formerly the sitios of Nag-ilong and Lugay in the barrio of Mainaga, constituted into a separate and independent barangay through ''[[Republic Act]] No. 212'', approved June 1, 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra212.html|title=An act creating the barrio of San Juan in the municipality of Mabini, province of Batangas|publisher=LawPH.com|date=|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n<!-- arranged by PSGC for easier updates in the future -->\n{{PH brgy table lite|top}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016001| Anilao Proper      |  650|  611}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016002| Anilao East        | 1626| 1566}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016003| Bagalangit         | 2458| 2613}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016004| Bulacan            | 1351| 1281}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016005| Calamias           | 1123| 1023}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016006| Estrella           |  716|  631}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016007| Gasang             | 2455| 2349}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016008| Laurel             | 1220| 1183}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016009| Ligaya             |  889| 1205}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016010| Mainaga            | 1951| 1735}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016011| Mainit             | 1076| 1050}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016012| Majuben            |  725|  640}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016014| Malimatoc I        |  955|  938}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016015| Malimatoc II       |  999| 1141}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016016| Nag{{nbhyph}}Iba   |  886|  904}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016017| Pilahan            |  765|  643}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016018| [[Poblacion]]      | 1911| 1472}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016019| Pulang Lupa        |  969| 1220}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016020| Pulong Anahao      | 1227| 1200}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016021| Pulong Balibaguhan |  940|  887}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016022| Pulong Niogan      | 1755| 1268}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016023| Saguing            | 1302| 1313}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016024| Sampaguita         | 1621| 1550}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016025| San Francisco      | 2052| 1762}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016026| San Jose           |  876|  865}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016027| San Juan           | 2124| 1975}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016028| San Teodoro        | 1913| 1783}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016029| Santa Ana          |  585|  712}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016030| Santa Mesa         | 1126| 1193}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016031| Santo Ni\u00f1o         |  678|  531}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016032| Santo Tomas        | 1210| 1136}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016033| Solo               | 2725| 2756}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016034| Talaga Proper      | 1636| 1571}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|041016035| Talaga East        | 1716| 1684}}\n{{PH brgy table lite|bottom|44391}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Mabini\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = 11925\n| 1939 = 10259\n| 1948 = 11850\n| 1960 = 15548\n| 1970 = 19522\n| 1975 = 21694\n| 1980 = 23637\n| 1990 = 30474\n| 1995 = 33499\n| 2000 = 37474\n| 2007 = 40629\n| 2010 = 44391\n| 2015 = 46211\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, Mabini had a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}}.{{PH census|current}} The population density was {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2}}.\n\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mabini,Batangasjf8695 13.JPG|thumb|Mabini General Hospital]]\n[[Jeepney]]s and [[tricycle]]s are the main means of transportation around the town.
