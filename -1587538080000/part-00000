He became manager of Drouet's Institution for the Deaf, where he hired [[Ethel Le Neve]], a young typist, in 1900 and they were having an affair by 1905.<ref name=ODNB/> After living at various addresses in London, the Crippens finally moved in 1905 to 39 Hilldrop Crescent, [[Camden Road]], [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], London, where they took in lodgers to augment Crippen's meagre income.

Hawley Crippen claimed that she had returned to the United States and later added that she had died and had been cremated in California. Meanwhile, his lover, Ethel \"Le Neve\" Neave, moved into Hilldrop Crescent and began openly wearing Cora's clothes and jewellery.\n\nPolice first heard of Cora's disappearance from her friend, the strongwoman Kate Williams, better known as [[Vulcana]],<ref name=\"Home_Truths\">{{Cite radio |last1=Hunt |first1=Jane |last2=Peel |first2=John |author2-link=John Peel |contribution=Vulcana and Atlas |title=[[Home Truths]] |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=August 30, 2004 |contribution-url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/20040830_vulcana_atlas.shtml |access-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref> but began to take the matter more seriously when asked to investigate by a personal friend of [[Scotland Yard]] [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] [[Frank Froest]], John Nash and his entertainer wife, Lil Hawthorne.<ref>Larson 2006, p. 347-348</ref> The house was searched but nothing was found and Crippen was interviewed by Chief Inspector [[Walter Dew]]. Crippen admitted that he had fabricated the story about his wife having died and explained that he had made it up in order to avoid any personal embarrassment because she had in fact left him and fled to America with one of her lovers, a music hall actor named Bruce Miller. After the interview (and a quick search of the house), Dew was satisfied with Crippen's story. However, Crippen and Le Neve did not know this and fled in panic to [[Brussels]], where they spent the night at a hotel. The following day, they went to [[Antwerp]] and boarded the [[Canadian Pacific]] liner {{SS|Montrose|1897|6}} for Canada.\n\nTheir disappearance led the police at [[Scotland Yard]] to perform another three searches of the house. During the fourth and final search, they found the torso of a human body buried under the brick floor of the basement. William Willcox (later Sir William Willcox, senior scientific analyst to the Home Office) found traces of the calming drug [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] in the torso parts.<ref name=\"oldbailey\">{{cite web|accessdate= |url=https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?div=t19101011-74 |title=Old Bailey Proceedings (11th October 1910)}}</ref> The corpse was identified by a piece of skin from its abdomen; the head, limbs, and skeleton were never recovered. Cora's remains were later interred at the St Pancras and Islington Cemetery, [[East Finchley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=St Pancras Cemetery|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/638853/st-pancras-cemetery}}</ref>\n\n===Transatlantic arrest===\n[[File:Dewcrippen.jpg|thumb|250px|A disguised Crippen after his arrest]]\nMeanwhile, Crippen and Le Neve were crossing the Atlantic on ''Montrose'', with Le Neve disguised as a boy. Captain [[Henry George Kendall]] recognised the fugitives and, just before steaming beyond the range of his ship-board transmitter, had telegraphist Lawrence Ernest Hughes send a wireless [[telegram]] to the British authorities: \"Have strong suspicions that Crippen London cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers. Mustache<!-- NOTE: This is how the word was spelled in the original quote, do not change it. Do not label it with \"sic\" as it's a perfectly acceptable alternative spelling --> taken off growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Manner and build undoubtedly a girl.\" Had Crippen travelled third class, he probably would have escaped Kendall's notice. Dew boarded a faster [[White Star Line|White Star]] liner, {{SS|Laurentic|1909|6}}, from Liverpool and arrived in [[Quebec]], Canada, ahead of Crippen, and contacted the Canadian authorities.\n\nAs ''Montrose'' entered the [[St. Lawrence River]], Dew came aboard disguised as a pilot. Canada was then still a [[dominion]] within the British Empire. If Crippen, an American citizen, had sailed to the United States instead, even if he had been recognised, it would have taken extradition proceedings to bring him to trial. Kendall invited Crippen to meet the pilots as they came aboard. Dew removed his pilot's cap and said, \"Good morning, Dr. Crippen. Do you know me? I'm Chief Inspector Dew from Scotland Yard.\" After a pause, Crippen replied, \"Thank God it's over. The suspense has been too great. I couldn't stand it any longer.\" He then held out his wrists for the handcuffs. Crippen and Le Neve were arrested on board the ''Montrose'' on 31 July 1910. Crippen was returned to England on board the {{SS|Megantic|1908|6}}.<ref name=\"shaws\">{{cite web|accessdate= |url=http://www.shawsavillships.co.uk/megantic.htm |title=Megantic \u2013 1908 |publisher=Shawsvillships}}</ref>\n\n==Trial ==\n[[File:crippen-scar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|upright|Alleged scar tissue used in evidence at the trial, claimed to be that of Cora Crippen]]\nCrippen was put on trial at the [[Old Bailey]] before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]] on 18 October 1910. The proceedings would last four days.\n\nThe first prosecution witnesses were pathologists that included [[Bernard Spilsbury]] who testified they could not identify the torso remains or even discern whether they were male or female. However, Bernard Spilsbury found a piece of skin with what he claimed to be an abdominal scar consistent with Cora's medical history.<ref name=spilsbury/><ref name=\"CNJ\">{{cite news |work= Camden New Journal |date=December 27, 2007 |page=14 |title=Will the Devil's advocate get a pardon for Crippen? |url=http://www.thecnj.com/review/2007/122707/feat122707_02.html?headline=Will_the_Devil%E2%80%99s_advocate_get_a_pardon_for_Crippen%3F|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}</ref> Large quantities of the toxic compound [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] were found in the remains, and Crippen had bought the drug before the murder from a local chemist.\n\nCrippen's defence, led by [[Alfred Tobin]],<ref>[https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001667/19150515/107/0006  ''Preston Herald'' - Saturday 15 May 1915]</ref> maintained that Cora had fled to America with another man named Bruce Miller and that Cora and Hawley had been living at the house since only 1905, suggesting a previous owner of the house was responsible for the placement of the remains. The defence asserted that the abdominal scar identified by pathologist Spilsbury was really just folded tissue, for among other things, it had hair follicles growing from it, something scar tissue could not have;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Spilsbury noted that the sebaceous glands appeared at the ends but not in the middle of the scar.<ref name=spilsbury/>\n\nOther evidence presented by the prosecution included a piece of a man's pyjama top supposedly from a pair Cora had given Crippen a year earlier. The pyjama bottoms were found in Crippen's bedroom, but not the top. The fragment included the manufacturer's label, Jones Bros. Curlers, with bleached hair consistent with Cora's were found with the remains.<ref name=Elmsley42>Elmsley, p.42</ref> Testimony from a Jones Bros. representative, the store that the pyjama top fragment came from, stated that the product was not sold prior to 1908, thus placing the date of manufacture well within the time period of when the Crippens occupied the house and when Cora gave the garment to Hawley the year before in 1909.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[File:The Trial of Dr-Crippen.jpg|thumb|Sketches from the trial of Dr. Crippen]]\nThroughout the proceedings and at his sentencing, Crippen showed no remorse for his wife, only concern for his lover's reputation. The jury found Crippen guilty of murder after just 27 minutes of deliberations. Le Neve was charged only with being an [[accessory after the fact]] and acquitted.<ref name=ODNB/> \n\nAlthough Crippen never gave any reason for killing his wife, several theories have been propounded. One was by notable Late Victorian and Edwardian barrister [[Edward Marshall Hall]] who believed that Crippen was using [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] on his wife as a depressant or [[anaphrodisiac]] but accidentally gave her an [[overdose]] and then panicked when she died.<ref name=spilsbury/> It is said that Hall declined to lead Crippen's defence because another theory was to be propounded.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Harry Hodge | first=Filson | last=Young | title=Famous Trials | volume=I | page=124 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth | year=1954 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, several British newspapers reported that [[Sir Hugh Rankin, 3rd Baronet|Sir Hugh Rhys Rankin]] claimed to have met Ethel Le Neve in 1930 in Australia where she told him that Crippen murdered his wife because she had [[syphilis]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The new murderers' who's who | first1=J.

She returned to England in 1915 and died in 1967.  At his request, her photograph was placed in his coffin and buried with him.\n\nAlthough Crippen's grave in Pentonville's grounds is not marked by a stone, tradition has it that soon after his burial, a rose bush was planted over it. Some of his relatives in Michigan have begun lobbying for his remains to be repatriated to the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Crippen's guilt==\nQuestions have arisen about the investigation, trial and evidence that convicted Crippen in 1910. [[Dornford Yates]], a [[junior barrister]] at the original trial, wrote in his memoirs ''As Berry and I Were Saying'', that Lord Alverstone took the very unusual step, at the request of the prosecution, of refusing to give a copy of the sworn affidavit used to issue the arrest warrant to Crippen's defence counsel. The judge without challenge accepted the prosecution's argument that the withholding of the document would not prejudice the accused's case. Yates said he knew why the prosecution did this but - despite the passage of years - refused to disclose why.<ref>''As Berry And I Were Saying'' {{ISBN|0-755-10036-0}} p. 253</ref> Yates noted that although Crippen placed the torso in dry [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] to be destroyed, he did not realise that when it became wet it turned into [[slaked lime]], which is a preservative: a fact that Yates used in the plot of his novel ''[[The House That Berry Built]]''.\n\nThe American-British crime novelist [[Raymond Chandler]] thought it unbelievable that Crippen could be so stupid as to bury his wife's torso under the cellar floor of his home while successfully disposing of her head and limbs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Raymond Chandler Speaking|last=Chandler|first=Raymond|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-520-20835-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/raymondchandlers00chan_0/page/197 197]|url=https://archive.org/details/raymondchandlers00chan_0/page/197}} (Letter to James Sandoe 15 December 1948)</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that Crippen was carrying out illegal [[abortion]]s and the torso was that of one of his patients who died and not his wife.<ref name=\"Telegraphy\">{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566391/US-scientists-Dr-Crippen-was-innocent.html | title = US scientists: Dr Crippen was innocent |date=October 17, 2007 | work = Telegraph | last=Cockcroft | first= Lucy | location=London| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===New scientific evidence===\nIn October 2007, [[Michigan State University]] [[forensic science|forensic scientist]] Dr David Foran claimed that [[mitochondrial DNA]] evidence showed the remains found beneath Crippen's cellar floor were not those of his wife, Cora Crippen.

He was hanged in [[Pentonville Prison]] in London for the murder of his wife Cora Henrietta Crippen, and was the first suspect to be captured with the aid of [[wireless telegraphy]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nCrippen was born in [[Coldwater, Michigan|Coldwater]], [[Michigan]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1393946/Hawley-Harvey-Crippen|title= Hawley Harvey Crippen|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate= June 21, 2014}}</ref> to Andresse Skinner<ref>US Federal Census: Year: 1880; Census Place: San Jose, Santa Clara, California; Roll T9_81; Family History Film: 1254081; Page: 54.3000; Enumeration District: 243; Image: 0335; and 1870 US Federal Census: 1870; Census Place: Coldwater Ward 2, Branch, Michigan; Roll M593_665; Page: 152A; Image: 310; Family History Library Film: 552164.</ref> (died 1909) and Myron Augustus Crippen<ref>{{cite web|accessdate= |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/crippen.html |title=Ancestry of Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen | last= Reitwiesner | first= William Addams |publisher=wargs.com}}</ref> (1827\u20131910), a merchant.<ref name=ODNB>\"Hawley Harvey Crippen\", [http://www.oxforddnb.com/ ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']</ref> Crippen studied first at the University of Michigan Homeopathic Medical School and graduated from the Cleveland Homeopathic Medical College in 1884.<ref name=\"Elmsley\">{{Cite journal|last=Elmsley|first=John|title=Molecules of Murder|year=2008|page=34|publisher=The Royal Society of Chemistry|place=Cambridge, UK|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Crippen's first wife, Charlotte, died of a [[stroke]] in 1892, and Crippen entrusted his parents, living in California, with the care of his two-year-old son, Hawley Otto.<ref name=\"Elmsley\"/>\n\nHaving qualified as a homeopath, Crippen started to practice in New York, where in 1894 he married his second wife,<ref name=ODNB/> Corrine \"Cora\" Turner<ref>1901 England Census: Source Citation: Class: RG13; Piece: 239; Folio: 41; Page: 19.</ref> (stage name: Belle Elmore), born Kunigunde Mackamotski to a German mother and a Polish-Russian father. She was a would-be music hall singer who openly had affairs. In 1894 Crippen started working for [[James M. Munyon|Dr Munyon]]'s, a homeopathic pharmaceutical company.\n\nIn 1897, Crippen moved to England with his wife,<ref name=ODNB/> although his US medical qualifications were not sufficient to allow him to practise as a doctor in the UK.<ref name=spilsbury>{{cite book | title=Bernard Spilsbury: his life and cases | first1=Douglas G. | last1=Browne | first2=E.V. | last2=Tullett | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth | year=1955 | pages=31\u201354 }}</ref> As Crippen continued working as a distributor of patent medicines,<ref>Larson 2006, p. 105</ref> Cora socialised with a number of variety players of the time, including [[Lil Hawthorne]] of The Hawthorne Sisters and Lil's husband/manager John Nash.<ref>Larson 2006, p. 159</ref>\n\nCrippen was sacked by Munyon's in 1899 for spending too much time managing his wife's stage career. He became manager of Drouet's Institution for the Deaf, where he hired [[Ethel Le Neve]], a young typist, in 1900 and they were having an affair by 1905.<ref name=ODNB/> After living at various addresses in London, the Crippens finally moved in 1905 to 39 Hilldrop Crescent, [[Camden Road]], [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], London, where they took in lodgers to augment Crippen's meagre income. Cora cuckolded Crippen with one of these lodgers, and in turn Crippen took Le Neve as his mistress in 1908.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n[[File:Belle Elmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Belle Elmore]]\n\n==Murder and disappearance==\nAfter a party at their home on 31 January 1910, Cora disappeared. Hawley Crippen claimed that she had returned to the United States and later added that she had died and had been cremated in California. Meanwhile, his lover, Ethel \"Le Neve\" Neave, moved into Hilldrop Crescent and began openly wearing Cora's clothes and jewellery.\n\nPolice first heard of Cora's disappearance from her friend The strongwoman Kate Williams, better known as [[Vulcana]],<ref name=\"Home_Truths\">{{Cite radio |last1=Hunt |first1=Jane |last2=Peel |first2=John |author2-link=John Peel |contribution=Vulcana and Atlas |title=[[Home Truths]] |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=August 30, 2004 |contribution-url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/20040830_vulcana_atlas.shtml |access-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref> but began to take the matter more seriously when asked to investigate by a personal friend of [[Scotland Yard]] [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] [[Frank Froest]], John Nash and his entertainer wife, Lil Hawthorne.<ref>Larson 2006, p. 347-348</ref> The house was searched but nothing was found and Crippen was interviewed by Chief Inspector [[Walter Dew]]. Crippen admitted that he had fabricated the story about his wife having died and explained that he had made it up in order to avoid any personal embarrassment because she had in fact left him and fled to America with one of her lovers, a music hall actor named Bruce Miller. After the interview (and a quick search of the house), Dew was satisfied with Crippen's story. However, Crippen and Le Neve did not know this and fled in panic to [[Brussels]], where they spent the night at a hotel. The following day, they went to [[Antwerp]] and boarded the [[Canadian Pacific]] liner {{SS|Montrose|1897|6}} for Canada.\n\nTheir disappearance led the police at [[Scotland Yard]] to perform another three searches of the house. During the fourth and final search, they found the torso of a human body buried under the brick floor of the basement. William Willcox (later Sir William Willcox, senior scientific analyst to the Home Office) found traces of the calming drug [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] in the torso parts.<ref name=\"oldbailey\">{{cite web|accessdate= |url=https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?div=t19101011-74 |title=Old Bailey Proceedings (11th October 1910)}}</ref> The corpse was identified by a piece of skin from its abdomen; the head, limbs, and skeleton were never recovered. Cora's remains were later interred at the St Pancras and Islington Cemetery, [[East Finchley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=St Pancras Cemetery|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/638853/st-pancras-cemetery}}</ref>\n\n===Transatlantic arrest===\n[[File:Dewcrippen.jpg|thumb|250px|A disguised Crippen after his arrest]]\nMeanwhile, Crippen and Le Neve were crossing the Atlantic on ''Montrose'', with Le Neve disguised as a boy. Captain [[Henry George Kendall]] recognised the fugitives and, just before steaming beyond the range of his ship-board transmitter, had telegraphist Lawrence Ernest Hughes send a wireless [[telegram]] to the British authorities: \"Have strong suspicions that Crippen London cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers. Mustache<!-- NOTE: This is how the word was spelled in the original quote, do not change it. Do not label it with \"sic\" as it's a perfectly acceptable alternative spelling --> taken off growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Manner and build undoubtedly a girl.\" Had Crippen travelled third class, he probably would have escaped Kendall's notice. Dew boarded a faster [[White Star Line|White Star]] liner, {{SS|Laurentic|1909|6}}, from Liverpool and arrived in [[Quebec]], Canada, ahead of Crippen, and contacted the Canadian authorities.\n\nAs ''Montrose'' entered the [[St. Lawrence River]], Dew came aboard disguised as a pilot. Canada was then still a [[dominion]] within the British Empire. If Crippen, an American citizen, had sailed to the United States instead, even if he had been recognised, it would have taken extradition proceedings to bring him to trial. Kendall invited Crippen to meet the pilots as they came aboard. Dew removed his pilot's cap and said, \"Good morning, Dr. Crippen. Do you know me? I'm Chief Inspector Dew from Scotland Yard.\" After a pause, Crippen replied, \"Thank God it's over. The suspense has been too great. I couldn't stand it any longer.\" He then held out his wrists for the handcuffs. Crippen and Le Neve were arrested on board the ''Montrose'' on 31 July 1910. Crippen was returned to England on board the {{SS|Megantic|1908|6}}.<ref name=\"shaws\">{{cite web|accessdate= |url=http://www.shawsavillships.co.uk/megantic.htm |title=Megantic \u2013 1908 |publisher=Shawsvillships}}</ref>\n\n==Trial ==\n[[File:crippen-scar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|upright|Alleged scar tissue used in evidence at the trial, claimed to be that of Cora Crippen]]\nCrippen was put on trial at the [[Old Bailey]] before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]] on 18 October 1910. The proceedings would last four days.\n\nThe first prosecution witnesses were pathologists that included [[Bernard Spilsbury]] who testified they could not identify the torso remains or even discern whether they were male or female. However, Bernard Spilsbury found a piece of skin with what he claimed to be an abdominal scar consistent with Cora's medical history.<ref name=spilsbury/><ref name=\"CNJ\">{{cite news |work= Camden New Journal |date=December 27, 2007 |page=14 |title=Will the Devil's advocate get a pardon for Crippen? |url=http://www.thecnj.com/review/2007/122707/feat122707_02.html?headline=Will_the_Devil%E2%80%99s_advocate_get_a_pardon_for_Crippen%3F|accessdate=October 1, 2008}}</ref> Large quantities of the toxic compound [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] were found in the remains, and Crippen had bought the drug before the murder from a local chemist.\n\nCrippen's defence, led by [[Alfred Tobin]],<ref>[https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001667/19150515/107/0006  ''Preston Herald'' - Saturday 15 May 1915]</ref> maintained that Cora had fled to America with another man named Bruce Miller and that Cora and Hawley had been living at the house since only 1905, suggesting a previous owner of the house was responsible for the placement of the remains. The defence asserted that the abdominal scar identified by pathologist Spilsbury was really just folded tissue, for among other things, it had hair follicles growing from it, something scar tissue could not have;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Spilsbury noted that the sebaceous glands appeared at the ends but not in the middle of the scar.<ref name=spilsbury/>\n\nOther evidence presented by the prosecution included a piece of a man's pyjama top supposedly from a pair Cora had given Crippen a year earlier. The pyjama bottoms were found in Crippen's bedroom, but not the top. The fragment included the manufacturer's label, Jones Bros. Curlers, with bleached hair consistent with Cora's were found with the remains.<ref name=Elmsley42>Elmsley, p.42</ref> Testimony from a Jones Bros. representative, the store that the pyjama top fragment came from, stated that the product was not sold prior to 1908, thus placing the date of manufacture well within the time period of when the Crippens occupied the house and when Cora gave the garment to Hawley the year before in 1909.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n[[File:The Trial of Dr-Crippen.jpg|thumb|Sketches from the trial of Dr. Crippen]]\nThroughout the proceedings and at his sentencing, Crippen showed no remorse for his wife, only concern for his lover's reputation. The jury found Crippen guilty of murder after just 27 minutes of deliberations. Le Neve was charged only with being an [[accessory after the fact]] and acquitted.<ref name=ODNB/> \n\nAlthough Crippen never gave any reason for killing his wife, several theories have been propounded. One was by notable Late Victorian and Edwardian barrister [[Edward Marshall Hall]] who believed that Crippen was using [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] on his wife as a depressant or [[anaphrodisiac]] but accidentally gave her an [[overdose]] and then panicked when she died.<ref name=spilsbury/> It is said that Hall declined to lead Crippen's defence because another theory was to be propounded.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Harry Hodge | first=Filson | last=Young | title=Famous Trials | volume=I | page=124 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth | year=1954 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, several British newspapers reported that [[Sir Hugh Rankin, 3rd Baronet|Sir Hugh Rhys Rankin]] claimed to have met Ethel Le Neve in 1930 in Australia where she told him that Crippen murdered his wife because she had [[syphilis]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The new murderers' who's who | first1=J.

She returned to England in 1915 and died in 1967.  At his request, her photograph was placed in his coffin and buried with him.\n\nAlthough Crippen's grave in Pentonville's grounds is not marked by a stone, tradition has it that soon after his burial, a rose bush was planted over it. Some of his relatives in Michigan have begun lobbying for his remains to be repatriated to the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Crippen's guilt==\nQuestions have arisen about the investigation, trial and evidence that convicted Crippen in 1910. [[Dornford Yates]], a [[junior barrister]] at the original trial, wrote in his memoirs ''As Berry and I Were Saying'', that Lord Alverstone took the very unusual step, at the request of the prosecution, of refusing to give a copy of the sworn affidavit used to issue the arrest warrant to Crippen's defence counsel. The judge without challenge accepted the prosecution's argument that the withholding of the document would not prejudice the accused's case. Yates said he knew why the prosecution did this but - despite the passage of years - refused to disclose why.<ref>''As Berry And I Were Saying'' {{ISBN|0-755-10036-0}} p. 253</ref> Yates noted that although Crippen placed the torso in dry [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] to be destroyed, he did not realise that when it became wet it turned into [[slaked lime]], which is a preservative: a fact that Yates used in the plot of his novel ''[[The House That Berry Built]]''.\n\nThe American-British crime novelist [[Raymond Chandler]] thought it unbelievable that Crippen could be so stupid as to bury his wife's torso under the cellar floor of his home while successfully disposing of her head and limbs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Raymond Chandler Speaking|last=Chandler|first=Raymond|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-520-20835-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/raymondchandlers00chan_0/page/197 197]|url=https://archive.org/details/raymondchandlers00chan_0/page/197}} (Letter to James Sandoe 15 December 1948)</ref>\n\nAnother theory is that Crippen was carrying out illegal [[abortion]]s and the torso was that of one of his patients who died and not his wife.<ref name=\"Telegraphy\">{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1566391/US-scientists-Dr-Crippen-was-innocent.html | title = US scientists: Dr Crippen was innocent |date=October 17, 2007 | work = Telegraph | last=Cockcroft | first= Lucy | location=London| accessdate=March 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===New scientific evidence===\nIn October 2007, [[Michigan State University]] [[forensic science|forensic scientist]] Dr David Foran claimed that [[mitochondrial DNA]] evidence showed the remains found beneath Crippen's cellar floor were not those of his wife, Cora Crippen.
