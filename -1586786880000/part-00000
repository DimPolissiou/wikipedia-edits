The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\nConvicted killer [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n\nNorman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]).\n\nOne of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n\nNorman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n\nBelieving the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n\nMary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n\nMary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n\nWhile removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n\nA stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n\nNorman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n\nNorman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with Norman Bates at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, Marion Crane ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner Norman Bates ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister Lila ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]]. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on A&E between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\nConvicted killer [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]], vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed.\n\nNorman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]).\n\nOne of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel.\n\nNorman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in.\n\nBelieving the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police.\n\nMary eventually finds Norman in the attic. The sheriff questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder.\n\nMary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother.\n\nMary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar.\n\nWhile removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar. Meanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk.\n\nRealizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house.\n\nA stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police.\n\nThe sheriff inaccurately believes Mary committed all the murders. That evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner.\n\nNorman gives her a cup of tea. Ms. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Ms. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel.\n\nNorman is now completely insane again. He carries Ms. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nThe film begins with Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\nNorman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his \"true\" mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician in his 20s desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles Marion Crane ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase Norman freaks out and leaves the diner.\n\nAfter the conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red (''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'''s [[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThe same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the [[Psycho (1960 film)|original]]) gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian, who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\". At that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\"\n\nShe discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nIn 1987, [[NBC]] released a [[television film]] spin-off entitled ''Bates Motel''. The film follows Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]), a man who roomed with Norman Bates at the state lunatic asylum for nearly 20 years. After the death of Bates, Alex finds that he is in Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant since the time of Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Fairville, California and with a little help from a teenage runaway named Willie ([[Lori Petty]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother?\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950 Norman's mother, Norma Bates ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to stab her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, Marion Crane ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.\n\nOwner Norman Bates ([[Vince Vaughn]]) tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister Lila ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth.

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

It was bundled with [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s on [[IBM PC compatible]]s by Microsoft. Microsoft also sold a BASIC [[compiler]], BASCOM, compatible with GW-BASIC, for programs needing more speed. The language is suitable for simple games, business programs and the like.

Common features of BASIC-80 5.x and BASICA/GW-BASIC include:\n\n*WHILE...WEND loops\n*Variable names of up to 40 characters\n*OPTION BASE statement to set the starting index of array variables as either 0 or 1\n*Dynamic string space allocation\n*LINE INPUT statement for reading in data from the keyboard\n*CALL statement for executing machine language routines\n*CHAIN and MERGE commands\n*Ability to save programs in either tokenized binary format or ASCII text\n\nThe ability to \"crunch\" program lines by omitting spaces, a common feature of earlier Microsoft BASIC implementations, was removed from BASIC-80 5.x and BASICA/GWBASIC.\n\nBASIC-80 programs not using PEEK/POKE statements run under GW-BASIC. BASICA adds many features for the IBM PC such as sound, graphics, and memory commands. Features not present in BASIC-80 include the ability to execute the RND function with no parameters and the ability to also save programs in a \"protected\" format, preventing them from being LISTed. BASICA also allows double-precision numbers to be used with mathematical and trigonometric functions such as COS, SIN, and ATN, which wasn't allowed in 8-bit versions of BASIC. This feature was normally not enabled and required the optional parameter /D at startup, ''i.e.'', <code>GWBASIC /D</code>. BASIC's memory footprint was slightly increased if it was used.\n\nMicrosoft did not offer a generic version of MS-DOS until v3.20 in 1986; before then, all variants of the operating system were OEM versions. Depending on the OEM, BASIC was distributed as either BASICA.EXE or GWBASIC.EXE. The former should not be confused with IBM BASICA, which always came as a .[[COM file]]. Some variants of BASIC has extra features to support a particular machine. For example, the AT&T and Tandy versions of DOS include a special GW-BASIC that supports their enhanced sound and graphics capabilities.\n\nThe initial version of GW-BASIC is the one included with Compaq DOS 1.13, released with the Compaq Portable in 1983, and was analogous to IBM BASICA 1.10. It uses the CP/M-derived file control blocks for disk access and does not support subdirectories. Later versions support subdirectories, improved graphics, and other capabilities.\n\nGW-BASIC 3.20 (1986) adds EGA graphics support (no version of BASICA or GW-BASIC had VGA support) and is the last new version released before it was superseded by [[QBasic]].\n\nBuyers of [[Hercules Graphics Card]]s received a special version of GW-BASIC on the card's utility disk that is called HBASIC, which adds support for its 720\u00d7348 monochrome graphics. Other versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC do not support Hercules graphics and can only display graphics on that card through the use of third-party [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] emulation, such as SIMCGA.\n\nGW-BASIC has a [[Command-line interface|command line]]-based [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) based on [[Dartmouth BASIC]]. Using the cursor movement keys, any line displayed on screen can be edited. It also includes [[function key]] shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. Like other early [[microcomputer]] versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacks many of the structures needed for [[structured programming]] such as local variables, and GW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly, because it was an [[interpreted language]]. All program lines must be numbered; all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in [[direct mode]] to be executed immediately. Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with [[Lexical analysis#Token|tokens]] replacing keywords, with an option to save in [[ASCII]] text form.<ref name=\"DocUtil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gwbasic.html |title=GW-BASIC Documentation and Utilities |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217161146/http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gwbasic.html |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\nThe GW-BASIC command-line environment has commands to <code>RUN, LOAD, SAVE, LIST</code> the current program, or quit to the operating <code>SYSTEM</code>; these commands can also be used as program statements. There is little support for [[structured programming]] in GW-BASIC. All <code>IF/THEN/ELSE</code> [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]] must be written on one line, although <code>WHILE/WEND</code> statements may group multiple lines. [[subroutine|Functions]] can only be defined using the single line <code>[[User-defined function#BASIC language|DEF FN]]f(x)=&lt;mathematical function of x&gt;</code> statement (e.g., <code>DEF FNLOG(base,number)=LOG(number)/LOG(base)</code>). The data type of [[Variable (computer science)|variable]]s can be specified with a character at the end of the variable name: <code>A$</code> is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of characters, <code>A%</code> is an [[integer]], etc. Groups of variables can also be set to default types based on the initial letter of their name by use of the <code>DEFINT, DEFSTR</code>, etc., statements. The default type for undeclared variables not identified by such typing statements, is single-precision [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] ([[Microsoft Binary Format#32-bit MBF|32-bit MBF]]).<ref name=\"Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gw-man/index.html|title=GW-BASIC User's Guide|year=1987|access-date=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref>\n\nGW-BASIC allows use of [[joystick]] and [[light pen]] input devices. GW-BASIC can read from and write to files and [[serial port|COM port]]s; it can also do event trapping for ports. Since the cassette tape port interface of the original IBM PC was never implemented on compatibles, cassette operations are not supported. GW-BASIC can play simple music using the <code>PLAY</code> statement, needing a string of notes represented in a [[music macro language]], e.g., <code>PLAY \"edcdeeL2edfedL4c\"</code>. More [[High- and low-level|low-level]] control is possible with the <code>SOUND</code> statement, which takes the arguments of a [[frequency]] in [[hertz]] and a length in clock ticks for the standard internal [[PC speaker]] in IBM machines. Consequently, sound is limited to single channel beeps and whistles as befits a 'business' machine. Home-based PCs like the [[Tandy 1000]] allow up to three channels of sound for the <code>SOUND</code> and <code>PLAY</code> commands.<ref name=\"Guide\"/>\n\n== Name ==\nThere are several theories on what the initials \"GW\" stand for. [[Greg Whitten]], an early [[Microsoft]] employee who developed the standards in the company's BASIC compiler line, says [[Bill Gates]] picked the name GW-BASIC.

Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with [[Lexical analysis#Token|tokens]] replacing keywords, with an option to save in [[ASCII]] text form.<ref name=\"DocUtil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gwbasic.html |title=GW-BASIC Documentation and Utilities |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217161146/http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gwbasic.html |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\nThe GW-BASIC command-line environment has commands to <code>RUN, LOAD, SAVE, LIST</code> the current program, or quit to the operating <code>SYSTEM</code>; these commands can also be used as program statements. There is little support for [[structured programming]] in GW-BASIC. All <code>IF/THEN/ELSE</code> [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]] must be written on one line, although <code>WHILE/WEND</code> statements may group multiple lines. [[subroutine|Functions]] can only be defined using the single line <code>[[User-defined function#BASIC language|DEF FN]]f(x)=&lt;mathematical function of x&gt;</code> statement (e.g., <code>DEF FNLOG(base,number)=LOG(number)/LOG(base)</code>). The data type of [[Variable (computer science)|variable]]s can be specified with a character at the end of the variable name: <code>A$</code> is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of characters, <code>A%</code> is an [[integer]], etc. Groups of variables can also be set to default types based on the initial letter of their name by use of the <code>DEFINT, DEFSTR</code>, etc., statements. The default type for undeclared variables not identified by such typing statements, is single-precision [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] ([[Microsoft Binary Format#32-bit MBF|32-bit MBF]]).<ref name=\"Guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gw-man/index.html|title=GW-BASIC User's Guide|year=1987|access-date=2008-06-28|author=}}</ref>\n\nGW-BASIC allows use of [[joystick]] and [[light pen]] input devices. GW-BASIC can read from and write to files and [[serial port|COM port]]s; it can also do event trapping for ports. Since the cassette tape port interface of the original IBM PC was never implemented on compatibles, cassette operations are not supported. GW-BASIC can play simple music using the <code>PLAY</code> statement, needing a string of notes represented in a [[music macro language]], e.g., <code>PLAY \"edcdeeL2edfedL4c\"</code>. More [[High- and low-level|low-level]] control is possible with the <code>SOUND</code> statement, which takes the arguments of a [[frequency]] in [[hertz]] and a length in clock ticks for the standard internal [[PC speaker]] in IBM machines. Consequently, sound is limited to single channel beeps and whistles as befits a 'business' machine. Home-based PCs like the [[Tandy 1000]] allow up to three channels of sound for the <code>SOUND</code> and <code>PLAY</code> commands.<ref name=\"Guide\"/>\n\n== Name ==\nThere are several theories on what the initials \"GW\" stand for. [[Greg Whitten]], an early [[Microsoft]] employee who developed the standards in the company's BASIC compiler line, says [[Bill Gates]] picked the name GW-BASIC.

In his enrolment in the University of Vienna (1500), he still latinised his name as ''Udalricus Zwingling de [[Lichtensteig]]'' ({{Harvnb|Jackson|1900|p=57}}).\nHis signature at the Marburg Colloquy (1529) was ''Huldrychus Zwinglius''  ({{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}; Schuler, Schultess (eds.), ''Huldrici Zuinglii opera'', 1830, p. 55). \nModern literature uses either \"Ulrich\" or \"Huldrych\" (e.g. [[George Richard Potter|Potter]] uses \"Ulrich\", while G\u00e4bler, Stephens, and Furcha use \"Huldrych\").}} (1 January 1484&nbsp;\u2013 11 October 1531) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]], born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]]. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly center of [[Renaissance humanism]]. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]].\n\nIn 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] where he began to preach ideas on reform of the Catholic Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of images in places of worship. In 1525, he introduced a new communion liturgy to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He also clashed with the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution. Historians have debated whether or not he turned Z\u00fcrich into a theocracy.<ref>Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press. 1967).</ref>\n\nThe Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war was averted at the last moment between the two sides. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers. They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and agreed on many points of doctrine, but they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|Real Presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]].\n\nIn 1531, Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z\u00fcrich was ill-prepared, and Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Historische Karte CH 1515.png|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515]]\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in BJ Beamer's time consisted of thirteen states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated areas and common lordships. He ruled them all. Unlike the modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of 1440\u20131446.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe wider political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the relationship with the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]] in 1499, the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThese internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' ({{lang-la |patria}}) began to take on meaning beyond a reference to an individual canton. At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536), the \"prince of humanism\"), had taken root in the Confederation. Within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss [[patriotism]] and humanism, Zwingli was born in 1484.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1484\u20131518)===\n[[File:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli.jpg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]]]\nHuldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in [[Wildhaus]], in the [[Toggenburg]] valley of [[Switzerland]], to a family of farmers, the third child of nine. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''[[Amtmann]]'' or chief local magistrate).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}</ref> Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]], where he probably met [[Katharina von Zimmern]].<ref name=\"katharina\">{{cite web|url=http://frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|title=Katharina von Zimmern|publisher=frauen-und-reformation.de|author=|date=|accessdate=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331123825/http://www.frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned [[Latin language|Latin]] under Magistrate Gregory B\u00fcnzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry W\u00f6lfflin. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}. Potter mentions this possibility. G\u00e4bler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern.</ref> However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records. However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=25}}. The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry. G\u00e4bler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time.</ref> Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=26}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was ordained in [[Constance]], the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}</ref> Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=29\u201333}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22\u201340}}</ref>\n\nZwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development. He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=33\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] at [[Z\u00fcrich]] became vacant. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossm\u00fcnster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Z\u00fcrich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=43\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich ministry begins (1519\u20131521)===\n[[File:Prozessionsachse murerplan.jpg|thumb|right|The Grossm\u00fcnster in the centre of the medieval town of Z\u00fcrich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]\nOn 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Z\u00fcrich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using [[Erasmus]]' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]], giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of ''[[lectio continua]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Old|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the [[Old Testament]]. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther K\u00f6hler.</ref> Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn.</ref> A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=46\u201347}}. A proponent of this view is Gottfried W. Locher.</ref>\n\nZwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]. His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=50}}</ref> This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}</ref>\n\nWithin the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Z\u00fcrich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] (31 October 1517).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}</ref> The council of Z\u00fcrich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1519, Z\u00fcrich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery. The final verses of the first part read:<ref>see e.g. {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n:''Thuo, wie du wilt;''\n:''mich n\u00fct befilt.''\n:''Din haf bin ich.''\n:''Mach gantz ald brich;''\n:''dann nimpst mich hin''\n:''der geiste min von diser Erd,''\n:''thuost du's, dass er nit b\u00f6ser werd,''\n:''ald anderen nit''\n:''befleck ir l\u00e4ben fromm und sit.

When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossm\u00fcnster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Z\u00fcrich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossm\u00fcnster.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=51}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===First rifts (1522\u20131524)===\nThe first public controversy regarding Zwingli's preaching broke out during the season of [[Lent]] in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the [[Affair of the Sausages]], is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Janz2008\">{{cite book|author=Denis Janz|title=A Reformation reader: primary texts with introductions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJWyDNATVwcC&pg=PA183|accessdate=15 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6310-0|page=183}}</ref> Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Z\u00fcrich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossm\u00fcnster and city council and repeating the traditional position.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=52\u201356}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, [[Anna Reinhart]], earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}</ref> They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Z\u00fcrich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apologeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich disputations (1523)===\n[[File:Switzerland Z\u00fcrich Grossm\u00fcnster Zwingli M\u00fcnch 1935.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Relief]] of Zwingli preaching at the pulpit, [[Otto M\u00fcnch]], 1935]]\nThe events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Z\u00fcrich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Z\u00fcrich's Confederation partners in the [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Diet]]. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Z\u00fcrich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and find its own solution.\n\n====First Disputation====\nOn 3 January 1523, the Z\u00fcrich city council invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Z\u00fcrich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=63\u201365}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=97\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his [[vicar general]], [[Johann Faber|Johannes Fabri]]. Zwingli summarised his position in the ''Schlussreden'' (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=99}}</ref><ref>The Sixty-seven Articles are contained in [https://archive.org/details/selectedworksofh00zwin ''Selected Works of Huldreich Zwingli'', Philadelphia, 1901], pp.&nbsp;111\u2013117.

The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=67\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n====Second Disputation====\nIn September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St. Peter, Z\u00fcrich|St. Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Z\u00fcrich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Z\u00fcrich, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur|Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=72, 76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nZwingli again took the lead in the disputation. His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing [[infant baptism]] with [[Credobaptism|adult baptism]]. This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]], one of the initiators of the [[Anabaptist]] movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=78\u201381}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n===Reformation progresses in Z\u00fcrich (1524\u20131525)===\n[[File:Zue Grossmuenster 06.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Above the entrance to the Grossm\u00fcnster doors is inscribed Matthew 11:28, \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"]]\nIn December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Z\u00fcrich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. [[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[triptych]]s remained covered and closed after [[Lent]].<ref name=\"Potter138\">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On [[Maundy Thursday]], 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nFor some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossm\u00fcnster and [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraum\u00fcnster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance [[Katharina von Zimmern]]) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy) or [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich|''Carolinum'']], at the Grossm\u00fcnster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school.<ref>According to {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531. Other sources say 1529 or 1530. See {{Harvnb|Estep|1986|p=96}} and {{Harvnb|Greenslade|1975|p=106}}. Early editions were called the Froschauer Bible, see {{Harvnb|Chadwick|2001|p=35}}.</ref> Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=97\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the Anabaptists (1525\u20131527)===\nShortly after the second Z\u00fcrich disputation, many in the [[Radical Reformation|radical wing of the Reformation]] became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Z\u00fcrich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. [[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Z\u00fcrich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]. Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 February, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Z\u00fcrich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia]]n towns. On 6\u20138 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossm\u00fcnster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Z\u00fcrich council decided that no compromise was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}</ref> Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Z\u00fcrich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the [[Limmat]]. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=John|title=The Reformation and the Anabaptists: Steps to Reconciliation, 26 June, 2004, Zurich, Switzerland|publisher=Mennonite Historical Committee|date=July 2004|url=http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324075102/http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archivedate=24 March 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012}} The descendants of the Zwinglian Reformation, the Reformed Church of Z\u00fcrich, and the descendants of the Anabaptist movement ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]]) held a Reconciliation Conference at the Grossm\u00fcnster on 26 June 2004. This link includes the conference program, and all statements made at that conference.</ref>\n\n===Reformation in the Confederation (1526\u20131528)===\n{{further|Swiss Reformation}}\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli Denkmal - Wasserkirche - Limmatquai 2011-08-10 11-47-50.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Zwingli in front of the ''[[Wasserkirche]]'' church in Z\u00fcrich]]\nOn 8 April 1524, five cantons, [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], formed an alliance, ''die f\u00fcnf Orte'' (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli's Reformation.<ref name=\"Potter138\" /> They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including [[John Eck]], who had debated Luther in the [[Leipzig Disputation]] of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]. Although Z\u00fcrich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] supported him.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Z\u00fcrich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Z\u00fcrich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[M\u00fcnster of Berne|St Vincent M\u00fcnster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[Nuremberg]]. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the M\u00fcnster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=113\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n===First Kappel War (1529)===\n{{Further|First war of Kappel}}\nEven before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche [[Burgrecht]]'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created.<ref>{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}. Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as \"Civic Union\", while {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=119}} translates it as \"Fortress Law\".</ref> The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Z\u00fcrich on 5\u20136 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, [[Biel]], [[M\u00fclhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on 22 April 1529.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352\u2013355}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bild Zwingli Asper.jpg|thumb|left|1549 painting by [[Hans Asper]]]]\nSoon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted ''Ratschlag \u00fcber den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Z\u00fcrich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Z\u00fcrich. The delegation called on Z\u00fcrich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, \"You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}. In [[Early Modern German]], \"Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben.\"</ref> Z\u00fcrich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on 8 June 1529. Z\u00fcrich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362\u2013367}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Z\u00fcrich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367\u2013369}}</ref> The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste [[Landfriede]]'', ended the war on 24 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=371}}</ref>\n\n===Marburg Colloquy (1529)===\n{{Further|Marburg Colloquy}}\n[[File:Marburger-Religionsgespr\u00e4ch.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coloured [[woodcut]] of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]\nWhile Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther's former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist). Understanding that Christ had ascended to heaven and was sitting at the Father's right hand, Zwingli criticized the idea that Christ's humanity could be in two places at once. Unlike his divinity, Christ's human body was not omnipresent and so could not be in heaven and at the same time be present in the elements. Timothy George, evangelical author, editor of Christianity Today and professor of Historical Theology at Beeson Divinity School at Samford University, has firmly refuted a long-standing misreading of Zwingli that erroneously claimed the Reformer denied all notions of real presence and believed in a memorial view of the Supper, where it was purely symbolic.<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (pp. 157-158). B&H Publishing Group.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise ''Dass Diese Worte Christi \"Das ist mein Leib etc.\" noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister'' (That These Words of Christ \"This is My Body etc.\" Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. [[Martin Butzer|Martin Bucer]] tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences. This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nZwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. In contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529, with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}</ref> The debates were held from 1\u20134 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Professor George summarized the incompatible views, \"On this issue, they parted without having reached an agreement. Both Luther and Zwingli agreed that the bread in the Supper was a sign. For Luther, however, that which the bread signified, namely the body of Christ, was present \u201cin, with, and under\u201d the sign itself. For Zwingli, though, sign and thing signified were separated by a distance\u2014the width between heaven and earth.\"<ref>George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (p. 156). B&H Publishing Group.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=\"Luther claimed that the body of Christ was not eaten in a gross, material way but rather in some mysterious way, which is beyond human understanding. Yet, Zwingli replied, if the words were taken in their literal sense, the body had to be eaten in the most grossly material way. \u201cFor this is the meaning they carry: this bread is that body of mine which is given for you. It was given for us in grossly material form, subject to wounds, blows and death. As such, therefore, it must be the material of the supper.\u201d Indeed, to press the literal meaning of the text even farther, it follows that Christ would have again to suffer pain, as his body was broken again\u2014this time by the teeth of communicants. Even more absurdly, Christ\u2019s body would have to be swallowed, digested, even eliminated through the bowels! Such thoughts were repulsive to Zwingli. They smacked of cannibalism on the one hand and of the pagan mystery religions on the other. The main issue for Zwingli, however, was not the irrationality or exegetical fallacy of Luther\u2019s views. It was rather that Luther put \u201cthe chief point of salvation in physically eating the body of Christ,\u201d for he connected it with the forgiveness of sins. The same motive that had moved Zwingli so strongly to oppose images, the invocation of saints, and baptismal regeneration was present also in the struggle over the Supper: the fear of idolatry. Salvation was by Christ alone, through faith alone, not through faith and bread. The object of faith was that which is not seen (Heb 11:1) and which therefore cannot be eaten except, again, in a nonliteral, figurative sense. \u201cCredere est edere,\u201d said Zwingli: \u201cTo believe is to eat.\u201d To eat the body and to drink the blood of Christ in the Supper, then, simply meant to have the body and blood of Christ present in the mind.\"<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy.

He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nAs Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, [[Johann Eck]], counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nWhen Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=148}}</ref>\n\nThe peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Z\u00fcrich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Z\u00fcrich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Z\u00fcrich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Z\u00fcrich. Z\u00fcrich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Z\u00fcrich army.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nZwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Z\u00fcrich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}</ref>  \n  \nIn Tabletalk, Luther is recorded saying: \"They say that Zwingli recently died thus; if his error had prevailed, we would have perished, and our church with us. It was a judgment of God. That was always a proud people. The others, the papists, will probably also be dealt with by our Lord God.\"<ref>Luther Works Tabletalk No. 94: God\u2019s Punishment of the Godless (Early November 1531)</ref> Erasmus wrote, \"We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and [[Oecolampadius]], whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many.  This is the wonderful hand of God on high.\"  Oecolampadius had died on 24 November.  Erasmus also wrote, \"If [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] had favoured them, it would have been all over with us.\"<ref>[[Philip Hughes (historian)|Philip Hughes]] (1957), ''A Popular History of the Reformation'', 1960 reprint, Garden City, NY:  Image Books, Ch. 4, \"Luther.

Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}</ref> He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used [[synecdoche]] <ref>{{citation|last=Yoder|first=John Howard|title=Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland: An Historical and Theological Analysis of the Dialogues Between Anabaptists and Reformers|publication-place=Kitchener, Ontario|pages=197\u2013202|year=2004|publisher=Pandora Press|isbn=1-894710-44-4}}</ref> and analogies, methods he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the eucharist and [[Passover]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64\u201366}}</ref> He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.\n\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'']]\nZwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180\u2013185}}</ref> (However, the word is also translated \"mystery\".) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nZwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Z\u00fcrich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was \"a memorial of the sacrifice\".<ref>''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol. I, 460.6\u201310, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}</ref> Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the \"signifies\" interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, \"It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail\". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Lutheran scholars, who seek to firmly establish Luther as the first Reformer. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther and the most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. He agreed with the stand Luther took against the pope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}</ref> Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=17}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nZwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the [[violin]], [[harp]], [[flute]], [[dulcimer]] and [[hunting horn]]. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his [[lute]] and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as \"the evangelical lute-player and fifer\". <!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf. ;) --> Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (c. 1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529).<ref>Hannes Reimann, ''Huldrych Zwingli \u2013 der Musiker'', ''[[Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft]]'' 17 2./3. (1960), pp. 126\u2013141</ref> These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=108}}</ref>\n\nZwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of \"prayer\". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship.<ref>Leith, John H, ''Introduction to the Reformed Tradition'', Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|0-8042-0479-9}} pp. 210\u2013211</ref> The organist of the People's Church in Z\u00fcrich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up.<ref name=\"Chadwick439\">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', Penguin, 1990, p. 439</ref> Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, \"The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer&nbsp;... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs\". Locher goes on to say that \"Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative\". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: \"The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'\u2014'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned\".<ref name=\"zwinglis thought\">{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|pp=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nToday's [[Musikabteilung]] (literally: music departement), located in the choir of the [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|''Predigern'' church in Z\u00fcrich]] was founded in 1971, and forms a scientific music collection of European importance. It publishes the materials entrusted to it at irregular intervals as CDs.

Bullinger immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's ascendancy, the confessional divisions of the Swiss Confederation stabilised.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 157\u2013158}}</ref> Bullinger rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms; Bullinger consolidated and refined them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p= 98}}</ref>\n\nScholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons. There is no consensus on the definition of \"Zwinglianism\"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] remains rudimentary.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 155\u2013156}}</ref> Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known example being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"Geneva Before Calvin\">{{cite journal|last= Foster|first= Herbert Darling|title= Geneva Before Calvin (1387\u20131536).

In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' (Z\u00fcrich Consensus). They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es and eventually in the wider world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp= 179\u2013195}}, J. C.

In his enrolment in the University of Vienna (1500), he still latinised his name as ''Udalricus Zwingling de [[Lichtensteig]]'' ({{Harvnb|Jackson|1900|p=57}}).\nHis signature at the Marburg Colloquy (1529) was ''Huldrychus Zwinglius''  ({{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}; Schuler, Schultess (eds.), ''Huldrici Zuinglii opera'', 1830, p. 55). \nModern literature uses either \"Ulrich\" or \"Huldrych\" (e.g. [[George Richard Potter|Potter]] uses \"Ulrich\", while G\u00e4bler, Stephens, and Furcha use \"Huldrych\").}} (1 January 1484&nbsp;\u2013 11 October 1531) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]], born during a time of emerging Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]]. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly center of [[Renaissance humanism]]. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]].\n\nIn 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] where he began to preach ideas on reform of the Catholic Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of images in places of worship. In 1525, he introduced a new communion liturgy to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. He also clashed with the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution. Historians have debated whether or not he turned Z\u00fcrich into a theocracy.<ref>Robert Walton, ''Zwingli's Theocracy'' (Toronto University Press. 1967).</ref>\n\nThe Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war was averted at the last moment between the two sides. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers. They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and agreed on many points of doctrine, but they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|Real Presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]].\n\nIn 1531, Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z\u00fcrich was ill-prepared, and Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:Historische Karte CH 1515.png|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515]]\nThe [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in Huldrych Zwingli's time consisted of thirteen states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]] of 1440\u20131446.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=1\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe wider political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the relationship with the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]] in 1499, the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThese internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' ({{lang-la |patria}}) began to take on meaning beyond a reference to an individual canton. At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536), the \"prince of humanism\"), had taken root in the Confederation. Within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss [[patriotism]] and humanism, Zwingli was born in 1484.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1484\u20131518)===\n[[File:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli.jpg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]]]\nHuldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in [[Wildhaus]], in the [[Toggenburg]] valley of [[Switzerland]], to a family of farmers, the third child of nine. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''[[Amtmann]]'' or chief local magistrate).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}</ref> Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]], where he probably met [[Katharina von Zimmern]].<ref name=\"katharina\">{{cite web|url=http://frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|title=Katharina von Zimmern|publisher=frauen-und-reformation.de|author=|date=|accessdate=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331123825/http://www.frauen-und-reformation.de/?s=bio&id=93|archive-date=31 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned [[Latin language|Latin]] under Magistrate Gregory B\u00fcnzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry W\u00f6lfflin. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}. Potter mentions this possibility. G\u00e4bler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern.</ref> However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records. However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=25}}. The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry. G\u00e4bler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time.</ref> Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=26}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was ordained in [[Constance]], the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}</ref> Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=29\u201333}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22\u201340}}</ref>\n\nZwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development. He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=33\u201341}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] at [[Z\u00fcrich]] became vacant. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossm\u00fcnster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Z\u00fcrich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=43\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich ministry begins (1519\u20131521)===\n[[File:Prozessionsachse murerplan.jpg|thumb|right|The Grossm\u00fcnster in the centre of the medieval town of Z\u00fcrich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]\nOn 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Z\u00fcrich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using [[Erasmus]]' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]], giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of ''[[lectio continua]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Old|1998|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the [[Old Testament]]. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=44\u201345}}</ref> One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther K\u00f6hler.</ref> Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn.</ref> A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=46\u201347}}. A proponent of this view is Gottfried W. Locher.</ref>\n\nZwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]. His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=50}}</ref> This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}</ref>\n\nWithin the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Z\u00fcrich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] (31 October 1517).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}</ref> The council of Z\u00fcrich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1519, Z\u00fcrich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery. The final verses of the first part read:<ref>see e.g. {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n:''Thuo, wie du wilt;''\n:''mich n\u00fct befilt.''\n:''Din haf bin ich.''\n:''Mach gantz ald brich;''\n:''dann nimpst mich hin''\n:''der geiste min von diser Erd,''\n:''thuost du's, dass er nit b\u00f6ser werd,''\n:''ald anderen nit''\n:''befleck ir l\u00e4ben fromm und sit.

When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossm\u00fcnster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Z\u00fcrich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossm\u00fcnster.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=51}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=73}}</ref>\n\n===First rifts (1522\u20131524)===\nThe first public controversy regarding Zwingli's preaching broke out during the season of [[Lent]] in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the [[Affair of the Sausages]], is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Janz2008\">{{cite book|author=Denis Janz|title=A Reformation reader: primary texts with introductions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJWyDNATVwcC&pg=PA183|accessdate=15 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6310-0|page=183}}</ref> Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Z\u00fcrich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossm\u00fcnster and city council and repeating the traditional position.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=52\u201356}}</ref>\n\nFollowing this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, [[Anna Reinhart]], earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}</ref> They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Z\u00fcrich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apologeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=57\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Z\u00fcrich disputations (1523)===\n[[File:Switzerland Z\u00fcrich Grossm\u00fcnster Zwingli M\u00fcnch 1935.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Relief]] of Zwingli preaching at the pulpit, [[Otto M\u00fcnch]], 1935]]\nThe events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Z\u00fcrich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Z\u00fcrich's Confederation partners in the [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Diet]]. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Z\u00fcrich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and find its own solution.\n\n====First Disputation====\nOn 3 January 1523, the Z\u00fcrich city council invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Z\u00fcrich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=63\u201365}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=97\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his [[vicar general]], [[Johann Faber|Johannes Fabri]].

The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=67\u201371}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n====Second Disputation====\nIn September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St. Peter, Z\u00fcrich|St. Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Z\u00fcrich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Z\u00fcrich, the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur|Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=72, 76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nZwingli again took the lead in the disputation. His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing [[infant baptism]] with [[Credobaptism|adult baptism]]. This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]], one of the initiators of the [[Anabaptist]] movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=78\u201381}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n===Reformation progresses in Z\u00fcrich (1524\u20131525)===\n[[File:Zue Grossmuenster 06.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Above the entrance to the Grossm\u00fcnster doors is inscribed Matthew 11:28, \"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\"]]\nIn December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Z\u00fcrich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. [[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[triptych]]s remained covered and closed after [[Lent]].<ref name=\"Potter138\">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=82\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On [[Maundy Thursday]], 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=105\u2013106}}</ref>\n\nFor some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossm\u00fcnster and [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraum\u00fcnster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance [[Katharina von Zimmern]]) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy) or [[Carolinum, Z\u00fcrich|''Carolinum'']], at the Grossm\u00fcnster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The [[Z\u00fcrich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school.<ref>According to {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531. Other sources say 1529 or 1530. See {{Harvnb|Estep|1986|p=96}} and {{Harvnb|Greenslade|1975|p=106}}. Early editions were called the Froschauer Bible, see {{Harvnb|Chadwick|2001|p=35}}.</ref> Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=97\u2013103}}</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the Anabaptists (1525\u20131527)===\nShortly after the second Z\u00fcrich disputation, many in the [[Radical Reformation|radical wing of the Reformation]] became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Z\u00fcrich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. [[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Z\u00fcrich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]. Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 February, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Z\u00fcrich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia]]n towns. On 6\u20138 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossm\u00fcnster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Z\u00fcrich council decided that no compromise was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}</ref> Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Z\u00fcrich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the [[Limmat]]. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=186\u2013188}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=John|title=The Reformation and the Anabaptists: Steps to Reconciliation, 26 June, 2004, Zurich, Switzerland|publisher=Mennonite Historical Committee|date=July 2004|url=http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324075102/http://www.mcusa-archives.org/events/statements_index.htm|archivedate=24 March 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012}} The descendants of the Zwinglian Reformation, the Reformed Church of Z\u00fcrich, and the descendants of the Anabaptist movement ([[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and [[Mennonites]]) held a Reconciliation Conference at the Grossm\u00fcnster on 26 June 2004. This link includes the conference program, and all statements made at that conference.</ref>\n\n===Reformation in the Confederation (1526\u20131528)===\n{{further|Swiss Reformation}}\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli Denkmal - Wasserkirche - Limmatquai 2011-08-10 11-47-50.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Zwingli in front of the ''[[Wasserkirche]]'' church in Z\u00fcrich]]\nOn 8 April 1524, five cantons, [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], formed an alliance, ''die f\u00fcnf Orte'' (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli's Reformation.<ref name=\"Potter138\" /> They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including [[John Eck]], who had debated Luther in the [[Leipzig Disputation]] of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]. Although Z\u00fcrich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] supported him.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Z\u00fcrich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Z\u00fcrich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[M\u00fcnster of Berne|St Vincent M\u00fcnster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[Nuremberg]]. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the M\u00fcnster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=113\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n===First Kappel War (1529)===\n{{Further|First war of Kappel}}\nEven before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche [[Burgrecht]]'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created.<ref>{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}. Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as \"Civic Union\", while {{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=119}} translates it as \"Fortress Law\".</ref> The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Z\u00fcrich on 5\u20136 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, [[Biel]], [[M\u00fclhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on 22 April 1529.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352\u2013355}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bild Zwingli Asper.jpg|thumb|left|1549 painting by [[Hans Asper]]]]\nSoon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted ''Ratschlag \u00fcber den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Z\u00fcrich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Z\u00fcrich. The delegation called on Z\u00fcrich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, \"You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}. In [[Early Modern German]], \"Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben.\"</ref> Z\u00fcrich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on 8 June 1529. Z\u00fcrich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362\u2013367}}</ref>\n\nZwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Z\u00fcrich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367\u2013369}}</ref> The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste [[Landfriede]]'', ended the war on 24 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=371}}</ref>\n\n===Marburg Colloquy (1529)===\n{{Further|Marburg Colloquy}}\n[[File:Marburger-Religionsgespr\u00e4ch.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coloured [[woodcut]] of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]\nWhile Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther's former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist). Understanding that Christ had ascended to heaven and was sitting at the Father's right hand, Zwingli criticized the idea that Christ's humanity could be in two places at once. Unlike his divinity, Christ's human body was not omnipresent and so could not be in heaven and at the same time be present in the elements. Timothy George, evangelical author, editor of Christianity Today and professor of Historical Theology at Beeson Divinity School at Samford University, has firmly refuted a long-standing misreading of Zwingli that erroneously claimed the Reformer denied all notions of real presence and believed in a memorial view of the Supper, where it was purely symbolic.<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (pp. 157-158). B&H Publishing Group.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=131\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nBy spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise ''Dass Diese Worte Christi \"Das ist mein Leib etc.\" noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister'' (That These Words of Christ \"This is My Body etc.\" Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. [[Martin Butzer|Martin Bucer]] tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences. This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=135\u2013136}}</ref>\n\nZwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. In contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529, with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}</ref> The debates were held from 1\u20134 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Professor George summarized the incompatible views, \"On this issue, they parted without having reached an agreement. Both Luther and Zwingli agreed that the bread in the Supper was a sign. For Luther, however, that which the bread signified, namely the body of Christ, was present \u201cin, with, and under\u201d the sign itself. For Zwingli, though, sign and thing signified were separated by a distance\u2014the width between heaven and earth.\"<ref>George, Timothy. Theology of the Reformers (p. 156). B&H Publishing Group.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=\"Luther claimed that the body of Christ was not eaten in a gross, material way but rather in some mysterious way, which is beyond human understanding. Yet, Zwingli replied, if the words were taken in their literal sense, the body had to be eaten in the most grossly material way. \u201cFor this is the meaning they carry: this bread is that body of mine which is given for you. It was given for us in grossly material form, subject to wounds, blows and death. As such, therefore, it must be the material of the supper.\u201d Indeed, to press the literal meaning of the text even farther, it follows that Christ would have again to suffer pain, as his body was broken again\u2014this time by the teeth of communicants. Even more absurdly, Christ\u2019s body would have to be swallowed, digested, even eliminated through the bowels! Such thoughts were repulsive to Zwingli. They smacked of cannibalism on the one hand and of the pagan mystery religions on the other. The main issue for Zwingli, however, was not the irrationality or exegetical fallacy of Luther\u2019s views. It was rather that Luther put \u201cthe chief point of salvation in physically eating the body of Christ,\u201d for he connected it with the forgiveness of sins. The same motive that had moved Zwingli so strongly to oppose images, the invocation of saints, and baptismal regeneration was present also in the struggle over the Supper: the fear of idolatry. Salvation was by Christ alone, through faith alone, not through faith and bread. The object of faith was that which is not seen (Heb 11:1) and which therefore cannot be eaten except, again, in a nonliteral, figurative sense. \u201cCredere est edere,\u201d said Zwingli: \u201cTo believe is to eat.\u201d To eat the body and to drink the blood of Christ in the Supper, then, simply meant to have the body and blood of Christ present in the mind.\"<ref name=\"George, Timothy pp. 157-158\">George, Timothy.

He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref>\n\nAs Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, [[Johann Eck]], counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nWhen Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Z\u00fcrich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=148}}</ref>\n\nThe peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Z\u00fcrich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Z\u00fcrich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Z\u00fcrich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=148\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Z\u00fcrich. Z\u00fcrich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Z\u00fcrich army.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nZwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Z\u00fcrich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Z\u00fcrich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}</ref>  \n  \nIn Tabletalk, Luther is recorded saying: \"They say that Zwingli recently died thus; if his error had prevailed, we would have perished, and our church with us. It was a judgment of God. That was always a proud people. The others, the papists, will probably also be dealt with by our Lord God.\"<ref>Luther Works Tabletalk No. 94: God\u2019s Punishment of the Godless (Early November 1531)</ref> Erasmus wrote, \"We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and [[Oecolampadius]], whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many.  This is the wonderful hand of God on high.\"  Oecolampadius had died on 24 November.  Erasmus also wrote, \"If [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] had favoured them, it would have been all over with us.\"<ref>[[Philip Hughes (historian)|Philip Hughes]] (1957), ''A Popular History of the Reformation'', 1960 reprint, Garden City, NY:  Image Books, Ch. 4, \"Luther.

Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}</ref> He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used [[synecdoche]] <ref>{{citation|last=Yoder|first=John Howard|title=Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland: An Historical and Theological Analysis of the Dialogues Between Anabaptists and Reformers|publication-place=Kitchener, Ontario|pages=197\u2013202|year=2004|publisher=Pandora Press|isbn=1-894710-44-4}}</ref> and analogies, methods he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the eucharist and [[Passover]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64\u201366}}</ref> He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.\n\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the ''[[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]'']]\nZwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180\u2013185}}</ref> (However, the word is also translated \"mystery\".) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nZwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Z\u00fcrich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was \"a memorial of the sacrifice\".<ref>''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol. I, 460.6\u201310, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}</ref> Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the \"signifies\" interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, \"It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail\". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Lutheran scholars, who seek to firmly establish Luther as the first Reformer. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther and the most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. He agreed with the stand Luther took against the pope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}</ref> Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=17}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nZwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the [[violin]], [[harp]], [[flute]], [[dulcimer]] and [[hunting horn]]. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his [[lute]] and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as \"the evangelical lute-player and fifer\". <!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf. ;) --> Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (c. 1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529).<ref>Hannes Reimann, ''Huldrych Zwingli \u2013 der Musiker'', ''[[Archiv f\u00fcr Musikwissenschaft]]'' 17 2./3. (1960), pp. 126\u2013141</ref> These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|p=108}}</ref>\n\nZwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of \"prayer\". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship.<ref>Leith, John H, ''Introduction to the Reformed Tradition'', Westminster John Knox Press, {{ISBN|0-8042-0479-9}} pp. 210\u2013211</ref> The organist of the People's Church in Z\u00fcrich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up.<ref name=\"Chadwick439\">Chadwick, Owen, ''The Reformation'', Penguin, 1990, p. 439</ref> Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, \"The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer&nbsp;... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs\". Locher goes on to say that \"Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative\". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: \"The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'\u2014'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned\".<ref name=\"zwinglis thought\">{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|pp=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nToday's [[Musikabteilung]] (literally: music departement), located in the choir of the [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|''Predigern'' church in Z\u00fcrich]] was founded in 1971, and forms a scientific music collection of European importance. It publishes the materials entrusted to it at irregular intervals as CDs.

Bullinger immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's ascendancy, the confessional divisions of the Swiss Confederation stabilised.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 157\u2013158}}</ref> Bullinger rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms; Bullinger consolidated and refined them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p= 98}}</ref>\n\nScholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons. There is no consensus on the definition of \"Zwinglianism\"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] remains rudimentary.<ref>{{Harvnb|G\u00e4bler|1986|pp= 155\u2013156}}</ref> Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known example being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in [[Geneva]].<ref name=\"Geneva Before Calvin\">{{cite journal|last= Foster|first= Herbert Darling|title= Geneva Before Calvin (1387\u20131536).

In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' (Z\u00fcrich Consensus). They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]es and eventually in the wider world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp= 179\u2013195}}, J. C.

News - Yahoo! Japan]]'' from ''RBB Today'' {{in lang|ja}}</ref>\n\nA greater amount of gay and transgender characters have also begun appearing (with positive portrayals) on Japanese television, such as the highly successful ''[[Hanazakari no Kimitachi e]]'' and ''[[Last Friends]]'' television series.\n\n==In anime and manga==\nThere is a genre of [[anime]] and [[manga]] that focuses on gay male romance (and sometimes explicit content) known as [[yaoi]]. Yaoi titles are primarily marketed to women, and are commonplace in bookstores (normally found in or near to the [[sh\u014djo manga]] section). Various terms are used in Japan to refer to yaoi.\n\nThe blanket term \"[[yaoi]]\" is an acronym for the phrase \"'''Ya'''ma nashi, '''o'''chi nashi, '''i'''mi nashi\", which means \"no peak, no point, no meaning\". (A [[backronym]] meant as a joke identifies it as \"'''Ya'''mete, '''o'''shiri (ga) '''i'''tai\" which literally means \"Stop, my bottom hurts!\").\n\n\"''June''\" refers to plots containing romance and drama that feature mature, adult male characters.   \"BL\" (\"Boys' Love\") refers to stories that either contain younger characters, or more light-hearted romance (as an alternative to more sexual content).  The phrase \"sh\u014dnen-ai\", translated from Japanese in the past as \"boy love\", is used to describe non-sexual homosexuality in either adult male characters or younger male characters. When manga or anime depicts sexual activities between young boys, or young boys with adults (male or female), it is known as \"[[shotacon]]\", which should not be confused with \"sh\u014dnen-ai\".\n\nAmong the large fan demographics in Western countries, this terminology is more or less condensed to \"yaoi\" and \"sh\u014dnen-ai\"; \"yaoi\" is used in reference to graphic descriptions of homosexual sex and/or adult drama, and \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" is used in reference to romantic situations with younger characters.\n\n[[Gei-comi]] (\"gay-comics\") are gay-romance themed comics aimed at gay men.  While yaoi comics often assign one partner to a stereotypical heterosexual female role, gei-comi generally depict both partners as masculine and in an equal relationship. Another common term for this genre is ''bara'', stemming from the name of the first publication of this genre to gain popularity in Japan, ''[[Barazoku]]''. The former term is more common in Japan, used similarly to ''yaoi'' as a blanket term for a wide range of publications, while the latter is more common in the West and more often refers to a general aesthetic rather than specifically the genre of comics.\n\nLesbian-romance themed anime and manga is known as ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' (which means \"lily\"). Yuri is used as a catch-all term, much more so than yaoi; it is used to describe female-female relationships in material marketed to straight men, straight women, or lesbians, despite significant stylistic and thematic differences between works aimed at these different audiences.  Another word that has recently become popular in Japan as an equivalent of yuri is \"GL\" (meaning \"Girls' Love\" and obviously inspired by \"Boys' Love\"). Unlike yaoi, yuri is aimed at a more widespread audience. There are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that heavily integrate yuri content) aimed at women, such as ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[Oniisama E]]'', ''[[Maria-sama ga Miteru]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' (most notably the third season, as well as the fifth season), ''[[Strawberry Shake Sweet]]'', ''[[Love My Life (manga)|Love My Life]]'', etc.; and there are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that heavily integrate yuri content) aimed at men, such as ''[[Kannazuki no Miko]]'', ''[[Strawberry Panic!]]'' (although it was written by Sakurako Kimino, a female author), ''[[Simoun (anime)|Simoun]]'', and ''[[My-Hime]]''. There are two manga magazines currently running in Japan that focus solely on yuri stories: ''[[Comic Yuri Hime]]'' (which is primarily aimed at women), and its newer spin-off, ''[[Comic Yuri Hime S]]'' (which is primarily aimed at men).\n\nWhile more yaoi manga exists, more yuri tends to be animated.\n\n== In other media ==\nWith the rise of a visible gay community and the attendant rise of media for gay audiences, the [[Hadaka Matsuri]] (\"Naked Festival\") has become a fantasy scenario for gay videos.<ref>''Male homosexuality in modern Japan: cultural myths and social realities'' By Mark J. McLelland, p.122; accessed through Google Books</ref>\n\nSuperstar Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki dedicated a song to celebrate gay rights titled \"How Beautiful You Are\".

Previously, ''sei'' was used to distinguish the binary biological sexes, female and male, as well as the concept of gender. Many terms describing gender presentation had vastly irregular meanings such as ''okama'', whose definitions included: a gay male, a feminine-behaving male, or a crossdresser. Umbrella terms such as these had a negative sociological impact, generalizing various queer identities into a single concept.

[[Razor Ramon Sumitani]] a.k.a. Hard Gay (HG), a comedian, shot to fame after he began to appear in public wearing a leather harness, hot pants and cap.  His outfit, name, and trademark pelvis thrusting and squeals earned him the adoration of fans and the scorn of many in the Japanese [[gay community]].\n\n[[Ai Haruna]] and [[Ayana Tsubaki]], two high-profile transgender celebrities, have gained popularity and have been making the rounds on some very popular Japanese variety shows.<ref>[http://www.japantoday.com/category/kuchikomi/view/television-perpetuates-outmoded-gender-stereotypes Television perpetuates outmoded gender stereotypes]</ref> {{Asof|April 2011}}, [[Hiromi (model)|Hiromi]], a [[fashion model]], came out as a lesbian.<ref>[http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20110218-00000016-rbb-ent \"Model Hiromi comes out as a homosexual : 'Love doesn't have any form, color and rule'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221135529/http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20110218-00000016-rbb-ent |date=2011-02-21 }}, 18 February 2011, ''[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! News - Yahoo! Japan]]'' from ''RBB Today'' {{in lang|ja}}</ref>\n\nA greater amount of gay and transgender characters have also begun appearing (with positive portrayals) on Japanese television, such as the highly successful ''[[Hanazakari no Kimitachi e]]'' and ''[[Last Friends]]'' television series.\n\n==In anime and manga==\nThere is a genre of [[anime]] and [[manga]] that focuses on gay male romance (and sometimes explicit content) known as [[yaoi]]. Yaoi titles are primarily marketed to women, and are commonplace in bookstores (normally found in or near to the [[sh\u014djo manga]] section). Various terms are used in Japan to refer to yaoi.\n\nThe blanket term \"[[yaoi]]\" is an acronym for the phrase \"'''Ya'''ma nashi, '''o'''chi nashi, '''i'''mi nashi\", which means \"no peak, no point, no meaning\". (A [[backronym]] meant as a joke identifies it as \"'''Ya'''mete, '''o'''shiri (ga) '''i'''tai\" which literally means \"Stop, my bottom hurts!\").\n\n\"''June''\" refers to plots containing romance and drama that feature mature, adult male characters.   \"BL\" (\"Boys' Love\") refers to stories that either contain younger characters, or more light-hearted romance (as an alternative to more sexual content).  The phrase \"sh\u014dnen-ai\", translated from Japanese in the past as \"boy love\", is used to describe non-sexual homosexuality in either adult male characters or younger male characters. When manga or anime depicts sexual activities between young boys, or young boys with adults (male or female), it is known as \"[[shotacon]]\", which should not be confused with \"sh\u014dnen-ai\".\n\nAmong the large fan demographics in Western countries, this terminology is more or less condensed to \"yaoi\" and \"sh\u014dnen-ai\"; \"yaoi\" is used in reference to graphic descriptions of homosexual sex and/or adult drama, and \"sh\u014dnen-ai\" is used in reference to romantic situations with younger characters.\n\n[[Gei-comi]] (\"gay-comics\") are gay-romance themed comics aimed at gay men.  While yaoi comics often assign one partner to a stereotypical heterosexual female role, gei-comi generally depict both partners as masculine and in an equal relationship. Another common term for this genre is ''bara'', stemming from the name of the first publication of this genre to gain popularity in Japan, ''[[Barazoku]]''. The former term is more common in Japan, used similarly to ''yaoi'' as a blanket term for a wide range of publications, while the latter is more common in the West and more often refers to a general aesthetic rather than specifically the genre of comics.\n\nLesbian-romance themed anime and manga is known as ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' (which means \"lily\"). Yuri is used as a catch-all term, much more so than yaoi; it is used to describe female-female relationships in material marketed to straight men, straight women, or lesbians, despite significant stylistic and thematic differences between works aimed at these different audiences.  Another word that has recently become popular in Japan as an equivalent of yuri is \"GL\" (meaning \"Girls' Love\" and obviously inspired by \"Boys' Love\"). Unlike yaoi, yuri is aimed at a more widespread audience. There are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that heavily integrate yuri content) aimed at women, such as ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'', ''[[Oniisama E]]'', ''[[Maria-sama ga Miteru]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' (most notably the third season, as well as the fifth season), ''[[Strawberry Shake Sweet]]'', ''[[Love My Life (manga)|Love My Life]]'', etc.; and there are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that heavily integrate yuri content) aimed at men, such as ''[[Kannazuki no Miko]]'', ''[[Strawberry Panic!]]'' (although it was written by Sakurako Kimino, a female author), ''[[Simoun (anime)|Simoun]]'', and ''[[My-Hime]]''. There are two manga magazines currently running in Japan that focus solely on yuri stories: ''[[Comic Yuri Hime]]'' (which is primarily aimed at women), and its newer spin-off, ''[[Comic Yuri Hime S]]'' (which is primarily aimed at men).\n\nWhile more yaoi manga exists, more yuri tends to be animated.\n\n== In other media ==\nWith the rise of a visible gay community and the attendant rise of media for gay audiences, the [[Hadaka Matsuri]] (\"Naked Festival\") has become a fantasy scenario for gay videos.<ref>''Male homosexuality in modern Japan: cultural myths and social realities'' By Mark J. McLelland, p.122; accessed through Google Books</ref>\n\nSuperstar Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki dedicated a song to celebrate gay rights titled \"How Beautiful You Are\".

''Pholiota'' spp. are separated from Armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print. [[Mushroom hunter]]s need to be wary of ''[[Galerina]] '' spp. which can grow side-by-side with ''Armillaria'' spp. on wood. ''[[Galerina]]'' have a dark brown spore print and are deadly poisonous ([[alpha-amanitin]]) \u2013 see: [[mushroom poisoning]].\n\n== Plant pathology ==\n{{main|Armillaria root rot}}\n\nHoney fungus is a \"white rot\" fungus, which is a [[pathogen]]ic organism that affects [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, woody climbers and, rarely, woody [[herbaceous perennial|herbaceous perennial plant]]s. Honey fungus can grow on living, decaying, and dead plant material.\n\nHoney fungus spreads from living trees, dead and live [[root]]s and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black [[rhizomorph]]s (root-like structures) at the rate of approximately 1 m a year, but infection by root contact is possible. Infection by spores is rare. Rhizomorphs grow close to the [[soil]] surface (in the top 20&nbsp;cm) and invade new roots, or the root collar (where the roots meet the stem) of plants. An infected tree will die once the fungus has [[Girdling|girdled]] it, or when significant root damage has occurred. This can happen rapidly, or may take several years. Infected plants will deteriorate, although may exhibit prolific [[flower]] or [[fruit]] production shortly before death.\n\nInitial symptoms of honey fungus infection include [[Forest dieback|dieback]] or shortage of leaves in spring. [[Mycelial_cord|Rhizomorphs]] (also called Mycelial cords) appear under the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and around the tree, and mushrooms grow in clusters from the infected plant in autumn and die back after the first frost. However these [[Symptom#Symptom versus sign|symptoms and signs]] do not necessarily mean that the pathogenic strains of honey fungus are the cause, so other identification methods are advised before diagnosis. Thin sheets of cream colored [[mycelium]], beneath the bark at the base of the trunk or stem indicated that honey fungus is likely the pathogen. It will give off a strong [[mushroom]] scent and the mushrooms sometimes extend upward. On [[conifers]] honey fungus often exudes a gum or [[resin]] from cracks in the bark.\n\nThe linkage of morphological, genetic, and molecular characters of ''Armillaria'' over the past few decades has led to the recognition of intersterile groups designated as \u201cbiological species\u201d. Data from such studies, especially those using molecular diagnostic tools, have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists. New questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of North American ''Armillaria'' species and their relationships to their European counterparts, particularly within the \u201c''Armillaria mellea'' complex\u201d. Some data suggest that North American and European ''A. gallica'' isolates are not monophyletic. Although North American and European isolates of ''A. gallica'' may be interfertile, some North American isolates of ''A. gallica'' are more closely related to the North American taxon ''A. calvescens'' than to European isolates of ''A. gallica''. The increase in genetic divergence has not necessarily barred inter-sterility between isolated populations of ''A. gallica''. Although the relationships among some groups in the genus seem clearer, the investigation of geographically diverse isolates has revealed that the relationship between some North American species is still unclear (Hughes et al. 2003).<ref name=\"hugh\">Hughes, M.B.; Weir, A.; Rogers, S.O. 2003.

[[Mushroom hunter]]s need to be wary of ''[[Galerina]] '' spp. which can grow side-by-side with ''Armillaria'' spp. on wood. ''[[Galerina]]'' have a dark brown spore print and are deadly poisonous ([[alpha-amanitin]]) \u2013 see: [[mushroom poisoning]].\n\n== Plant pathology ==\n{{main|Armillaria root rot}}\n\nHoney fungus is a \"white rot\" fungus, which is a [[pathogen]]ic organism that affects [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, woody climbers and, rarely, woody [[herbaceous perennial|herbaceous perennial plant]]s. Honey fungus can grow on living, decaying, and dead plant material.\n\nHoney fungus spreads from living trees, dead and live [[root]]s and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black [[rhizomorph]]s (root-like structures) at the rate of approximately 1 m a year, but infection by root contact is possible. Infection by spores is rare. Rhizomorphs grow close to the [[soil]] surface (in the top 20&nbsp;cm) and invade new roots, or the root collar (where the roots meet the stem) of plants. An infected tree will die once the fungus has [[Girdling|girdled]] it, or when significant root damage has occurred. This can happen rapidly, or may take several years. Infected plants will deteriorate, although may exhibit prolific [[flower]] or [[fruit]] production shortly before death.\n\nInitial symptoms of honey fungus infection include [[Forest dieback|dieback]] or shortage of leaves in spring. Rhizomorphs appear under the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and around the tree, and mushrooms grow in clusters from the infected plant in autumn and die back after the first frost. However these [[Symptom#Symptom versus sign|symptoms and signs]] do not necessarily mean that the pathogenic strains of honey fungus are the cause, so other identification methods are advised before diagnosis. Thin sheets of cream colored [[mycelium]], beneath the bark at the base of the trunk or stem indicated that honey fungus is likely the pathogen. It will give off a strong [[mushroom]] scent and the mushrooms sometimes extend upward. On [[conifers]] honey fungus often exudes a gum or [[resin]] from cracks in the bark.\n\nThe linkage of morphological, genetic, and molecular characters of ''Armillaria'' over the past few decades has led to the recognition of intersterile groups designated as \u201cbiological species\u201d. Data from such studies, especially those using molecular diagnostic tools, have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists. New questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of North American ''Armillaria'' species and their relationships to their European counterparts, particularly within the \u201c''Armillaria mellea'' complex\u201d. Some data suggest that North American and European ''A. gallica'' isolates are not monophyletic. Although North American and European isolates of ''A. gallica'' may be interfertile, some North American isolates of ''A. gallica'' are more closely related to the North American taxon ''A. calvescens'' than to European isolates of ''A. gallica''. The increase in genetic divergence has not necessarily barred inter-sterility between isolated populations of ''A. gallica''. Although the relationships among some groups in the genus seem clearer, the investigation of geographically diverse isolates has revealed that the relationship between some North American species is still unclear (Hughes et al. 2003).<ref name=\"hugh\">Hughes, M.B.; Weir, A.; Rogers, S.O. 2003.
