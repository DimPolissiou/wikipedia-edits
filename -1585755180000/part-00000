From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.

In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009.

From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far. This percentage was enough to offset a decline in the CDU/CSU's vote compared to 2005, to create a CDU-FDP centre-right governing coalition in the Bundestag with a 53% majority of seats.

In the [[2014 Saxony state election]], the party experienced a 5.2% down-swing, again losing all of its seats. In the [[2014 Thuringian state election]] a similar phenomenon was repeated with the party falling below the 5% threshold following a 5.1% drop in popular vote.\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nThe party managed to enter parliament in the [[2015 Bremen state election]] with the party receiving 6.5% of the vote and gaining 6 seats. However, it failed to get into government as a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Greens was created. In the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]] the party failed to get into parliament despite increasing its vote share by 0.3%. The party did manage to get into parliament in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], gaining 3% of the vote and a total of 12 seats. This represents a five-seat improvement over their previous results. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]] the party gained 4.9% of the vote and 12 seats but still failed to get into government. A red-red-green coalition was instead formed relegating the FDP to the opposition. In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the party managed to enter parliament receiving 6.2% of the vote and 7 seats. It also managed to enter government under a [[traffic light coalition]]. In [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]] the party narrowly missed the 5% threshold, receiving 4.9% of the vote and therefore receiving zero seats despite a 1% swing in their favour.\n\nThe [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] was widely considered a test of the party's future as their chairman Christian Lindner was also leading the party in that state. The party experienced a 4% swing in its favour gaining 6 seats and entering into a coalition with the CDU with a bare majority. In the [[2017 Saarland state election]] the party again failed to gain any seats despite a 1% swing in their favour. The party gained 3 seats and increased its vote share by 3.2% in the [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election]]. This success was often credited to their state chairman [[Wolfgang Kubicki]]. They also managed to re-enter the government under a [[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]].\n\nIn the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the party scored 10.7% of votes and re-entered the Bundestag, winning 80 seats.\n\nThe FDP won 5.4% and 5 seats in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European elections]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Thuringian state election|October 2019 Thuringian state election]], the FDP won seats in the Landtag of [[Thuringia]] for the first time since 2009.

He was one of the two sons of J\u00e1nos (IV) Cs\u00e1nyi (fl. 1444\u201375) and Katalin Hossz\u00fat\u00f3ti (fl. 1467\u201368).<ref name=hahot>Engel: ''Geneal\u00f3gia'' (Genus Hah\u00f3t 2., Buz\u00e1d branch)</ref> J\u00e1nos was a prominent ''[[Familiaris|familiar]]'' to the Pet\u0151 de Gerse family since 1453, but later joined the Kanizsais in the late 1460s.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=11}} Bal\u00e1zs first appeared in a contemporary document in 1475, when [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]] confirmed the previously inherited and acquired villages and estates of the Cs\u00e1nyi family in Zala (for instance, [[Zalacs\u00e1ny|Cs\u00e1ny]], [[Tilaj, Hungary|Tilaj]] and [[Bocf\u00f6lde]]), [[Somogy County (former)|Somogy]] ([[V\u00f6rs]]) and [[Vas County (former)|Vas]] Counties ([[Nagytilaj]]). Beside the young Bal\u00e1zs II, the royal charter mentioned his still living grandfather Bal\u00e1zs I, father J\u00e1nos IV, brother Mikl\u00f3s I and cousin M\u00e1rton I by name. The land donation was registered by the Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r monastery.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=12}}\n\nHe was mentioned next time in the 1490s in estate affairs. In 1496, he filed a lawsuit against his relatives through his maternal grandmother Anna Egerv\u00e1ri in connection with an inheritance dispute over lands in Zala, Vas and [[Kri\u017eevci County|Kri\u017eevci]] Counties. Bal\u00e1zs pledged the domain of [[Kissz\u0151l\u0151s]] from D\u00e9nes Cseneh\u00e1zi, then vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County, on 13 October 1497.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=13}} According to a royal charter of [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]] in 1498, his serfs and ''familiar''s plundered the estate of the [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Pauline]] Abbey of \u00d6rm\u00e9nyes (today in [[Kehidakust\u00e1ny]]), when they were illegally hunting in the Paulines' forest. Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi also had conflict with the Rajki family, who otherwise were relatives of his brother Mikl\u00f3s I (fl. 1464\u20131529), who married Veronika Rajki. According to a report published by the Zalav\u00e1r Abbey on 24 July 1499, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de Rajk complained that his relative Ferenc plundered his lands in [[Hah\u00f3t, Zala|Hah\u00f3t]] and Buz\u00e1dsziget (or S\u00e1rk\u00e1nysziget), while Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi did not return the occupied estate of [[Tormaf\u00f6lde]] and its related movable property. Finally, in 1500, Cs\u00e1nyi entered into an arrangement with his relative, the famous lawyer [[Detre Rajki]] to mutually withdraw their legal actions.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=13}}\n\n==Career==\nCs\u00e1nyi started his political career as a member of the royal court of Vladislaus II, first mentioned in this capacity in 1500.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=13}} He served as one of the concurrent vice-''isp\u00e1n''s of Zala County from 1500 to 1501. In this regard, he first appeared in contemporary documents on 6 April 1500, alongside Ill\u00e9s Terj\u00e9k de Szenterzs\u00e9bet.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=251}} In 1504 and 1506, he was mentioned as the appointed tax-collector (''dicator'') of the county, alongside Ferenc S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de \u00c1kosh\u00e1za.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=257}} Along with co-envoys Gy\u00f6rgy Kerecsenyi and Andr\u00e1s Kaczor de Lak, he represented Zala County in the Diet of R\u00e1kos (1505), where the delegates passed a bill which prohibited the election of a foreigner as king if Vladislaus's died without a male issue. According to a charter, Cs\u00e1nyi and his companions requested a copy of the document from [[Judge royal]] Peter Szentgy\u00f6rgyi de Bazin. By that time, he has gained considerable wealth, as the \"nobles of Zala County\" (i.e. ''generalis congregatio'', the county assembly) borrowed him 1,100 florin to establish and equip ''[[militia portalis]]'' in 1506.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAccording to historian Ir\u00e9n Bilkei, Cs\u00e1nyi again served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County in 1511, but his name did not appear in archontological lists in that year. He was appointed juror during a trial by the general assembly which sentenced \"proscribed\" nobles in 1512.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}} As a tax registration from 1513 preserved, Cs\u00e1nyi had seven ''porta'' (or peasant household) and resided in Cs\u00e1ny in a stone-built manor house, which later was enlarged to a fortress by his son [[\u00c1kos Cs\u00e1nyi|\u00c1kos]] in the middle of the 16th century. An Italian cartographer and military engineer Giulio Turco depicted the ground plan of the fort in a drawing in 1569, among other castles and strongholds. The maps are displayed in the ''Kriegsarchiv'' of [[Vienna]]. However, Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi himself did not hold any castle.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAlongside Detre Rajki, he was referred to as \"the king's man\" in 1516 during an investigation of a suspected violation of law by Tam\u00e1s Pet\u0151 de Gerse.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In the same year, as one of the representatives of the lesser nobility (the so-called noble jurors), Cs\u00e1nyi was elected to the royal council of the young [[Louis II of Hungary]], who ascended the throne shortly before.{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Louis reaffirmed the land donations to the Cs\u00e1nyi family upon Bal\u00e1zs' request. Cs\u00e1nyi served as envoy of Zala County at the Diet of B\u00e1cs in 1518 (today [[Ba\u010d, Serbia]]). He was again mentioned as a noble juror of the royal council in 1519.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In 1520, Mikl\u00f3s Kapornay, Abbot of Zalav\u00e1r wrote in his document that Cs\u00e1nyi guaranteed the debt payment of the abbey to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Istv\u00e1n Terj\u00e9k, in exchange for the collateral of [[Zalav\u00e1r]] domain. On 3 July 1520, King Louis II commissioned Cs\u00e1nyi, among others, to investigate the report of the Buda Chapter, which complained that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kanizsai's soldiers attacked its serfs in the chapel estates of [[Zalakaros|Karos]] and [[Galambok]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} From 17 September 1520 to 1527, Cs\u00e1nyi served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County for the second (or third) time.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=252}} Meanwhile, he functioned as ''isp\u00e1n'' (or head) of the chamber of salt in [[Transylvania]] in 1523, as his own charter claimed. He held that position, when his relative, the influential Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny de Cs\u00e9b held the dignity of ''isp\u00e1n'' of chamber of salt in [[M\u00e1ramaros County|M\u00e1ramaros]] (today [[Maramure\u0219]], [[Romania]]).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\nCs\u00e1nyi did not participate in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], where his relatives, Ambrus S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny and Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny were killed. He held the office of vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County until 1527. In that year, he represented his county alongside Istv\u00e1n Gyulafi and D\u00e9nes H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi at the Diet of [[Buda]] which was convened by [[John Z\u00e1polya]].{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=241}} Following that Cs\u00e1nyi gradually retired from public life. On 1 January 1529, he bought lands in Als\u00f3kust\u00e1n from local noble L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Holl\u00f3si. A county ''dicalis'' of 1531 listed Cs\u00e1nyi's property: 12 ''porta''s in Cs\u00e1ny and 16 ''porta''s in [[Vindornyasz\u0151l\u0151s]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}} In his last years, he was ''familiar'' to the powerful [[N\u00e1dasdy family]] alongside his brother and sons. According to an undated letter of his son \u00c1kos to his lord [[Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy]], his father Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi and two of his brothers, Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of a plague which had broken out following the Ottoman campaign and the [[Siege of G\u00fcns|Siege of K\u0151szeg]] in the summer of 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}}\n\n==Family==\nBased on a document of fragmentary genealogical data from the early 16th century,{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Ir\u00e9n Bilkei claimed that Cs\u00e1nyi married an unidentified lady from the S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de \u00c1kosh\u00e1za family. A possession agreement in Somogy County from 1515 preserved his sons' names: Mikl\u00f3s, Istv\u00e1n, J\u00e1nos, Gergely and \u00c1kos. Two of them Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of plague in 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}} J\u00e1nos (V) was never mentioned again.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} \u00c1kos, whose collection of 500 letters to Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy is one of the most important primary sources of the 16th-century Hungarian history, married Anna Sitkey, they had a daughter Orsolya. Later members of the Cs\u00e1nyi family descended from Mikl\u00f3s II (fl. 1500\u201341), who married L\u00facia Mar\u00e1czy.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=20}} Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi also had daughters: Margit married John H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi, as a document of 1554 from a [[Place of authentication]] recorded. His other unidentified daughter was the mother of Jakab Zele de Szentbal\u00e1zs, head of the court of Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy in [[Nagykanizsa|Kanizsa]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}}\n\nAt the county assembly of 9 December 1524, his niece Orsolya (daughter of Mikl\u00f3s I Cs\u00e1nyi and Veronika Rajki) filed a lawsuit against him for her mother's dowry and morning-gift. During the trial, the property of Cs\u00e1ny, Tilaj, Erd\u0151h\u00e1t e.g. were involved. There was a second trial in 1528 on the occasion of the [[last will and testament]] of Mikl\u00f3s I between Bal\u00e1zs and Orsolya Cs\u00e1nyi (who, by then, married G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Terj\u00e9k).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bilkei |first=Ir\u00e9n |editor1-last=Bilkei |editor1-first=Ir\u00e9n |title=Zalai \u00e9vsz\u00e1zadok.

He was one of the two sons of J\u00e1nos (IV) Cs\u00e1nyi (fl. 1444\u201375) and Katalin Hossz\u00fat\u00f3ti (fl. 1467\u201368).<ref name=hahot>Engel: ''Geneal\u00f3gia'' (Genus Hah\u00f3t 2., Buz\u00e1d branch)</ref> J\u00e1nos was a prominent ''[[Familiaris|familiar]]'' to the Pet\u0151 de Gerse family since 1453, but later joined the Kanizsais in the late 1460s.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=11}} Bal\u00e1zs first appeared in a contemporary document in 1475, when [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]] confirmed the previously inherited and acquired villages and estates of the Cs\u00e1nyi family in Zala (for instance, [[Zalacs\u00e1ny|Cs\u00e1ny]], [[Tilaj, Hungary|Tilaj]] and [[Bocf\u00f6lde]]), [[Somogy County (former)|Somogy]] ([[V\u00f6rs]]) and [[Vas County (former)|Vas]] Counties ([[Nagytilaj]]). Beside the young Bal\u00e1zs II, the royal charter mentioned his still living grandfather Bal\u00e1zs I, father J\u00e1nos IV, brother Mikl\u00f3s I and cousin M\u00e1rton I by name. The land donation was registered by the Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r monastery.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=12}}\n\nHe was mentioned next time in the 1490s in estate affairs. In 1496, he filed a lawsuit against his relatives through his maternal grandmother Anna Egerv\u00e1ri in connection with an inheritance dispute over lands in Zala, Vas and [[Kri\u017eevci County|Kri\u017eevci]] Counties. Bal\u00e1zs pledged the domain of [[Kissz\u0151l\u0151s]] from D\u00e9nes Cseneh\u00e1zi, then vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County, on 13 October 1497.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=13}} According to a royal charter of [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]] in 1498, his serfs and ''familiar''s plundered the estate of the [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Pauline]] Abbey of \u00d6rm\u00e9nyes (today in [[Kehidakust\u00e1ny]]), when they were illegally hunting in the Paulines' forest. Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi also had conflict with the Rajki family, who otherwise were relatives of his brother Mikl\u00f3s I (fl. 1464\u20131529), who married Veronika Rajki. According to a report published by the Zalav\u00e1r Abbey on 24 July 1499, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de Rajk complained that his relative Ferenc plundered his lands in [[Hah\u00f3t]] and Buz\u00e1dsziget (or S\u00e1rk\u00e1nysziget), while Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi did not return the occupied estate of [[Tormaf\u00f6lde]] and its related movable property. Finally, in 1500, Cs\u00e1nyi entered into an arrangement with his relative, the famous lawyer [[Detre Rajki]] to mutually withdraw their legal actions.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=13}}\n\n==Career==\nCs\u00e1nyi started his political career as a member of the royal court of Vladislaus II, first mentioned in this capacity in 1500.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=13}} He served as one of the concurrent vice-''isp\u00e1n''s of Zala County from 1500 to 1501. In this regard, he first appeared in contemporary documents on 6 April 1500, alongside Ill\u00e9s Terj\u00e9k de Szenterzs\u00e9bet.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=251}} In 1504 and 1506, he was mentioned as the appointed tax-collector (''dicator'') of the county, alongside Ferenc S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de \u00c1kosh\u00e1za.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=257}} Along with co-envoys Gy\u00f6rgy Kerecsenyi and Andr\u00e1s Kaczor de Lak, he represented Zala County in the Diet of R\u00e1kos (1505), where the delegates passed a bill which prohibited the election of a foreigner as king if Vladislaus's died without a male issue. According to a charter, Cs\u00e1nyi and his companions requested a copy of the document from [[Judge royal]] Peter Szentgy\u00f6rgyi de Bazin. By that time, he has gained considerable wealth, as the \"nobles of Zala County\" (i.e. ''generalis congregatio'', the county assembly) borrowed him 1,100 florin to establish and equip ''[[militia portalis]]'' in 1506.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAccording to historian Ir\u00e9n Bilkei, Cs\u00e1nyi again served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County in 1511, but his name did not appear in archontological lists in that year. He was appointed juror during a trial by the general assembly which sentenced \"proscribed\" nobles in 1512.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}} As a tax registration from 1513 preserved, Cs\u00e1nyi had seven ''porta'' (or peasant household) and resided in Cs\u00e1ny in a stone-built manor house, which later was enlarged to a fortress by his son [[\u00c1kos Cs\u00e1nyi|\u00c1kos]] in the middle of the 16th century. An Italian cartographer and military engineer Giulio Turco depicted the ground plan of the fort in a drawing in 1569, among other castles and strongholds. The maps are displayed in the ''Kriegsarchiv'' of [[Vienna]]. However, Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi himself did not hold any castle.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=14}}\n\nAlongside Detre Rajki, he was referred to as \"the king's man\" in 1516 during an investigation of a suspected violation of law by Tam\u00e1s Pet\u0151 de Gerse.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In the same year, as one of the representatives of the lesser nobility (the so-called noble jurors), Cs\u00e1nyi was elected to the royal council of the young [[Louis II of Hungary]], who ascended the throne shortly before.{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Louis reaffirmed the land donations to the Cs\u00e1nyi family upon Bal\u00e1zs' request. Cs\u00e1nyi served as envoy of Zala County at the Diet of B\u00e1cs in 1518 (today [[Ba\u010d, Serbia]]). He was again mentioned as a noble juror of the royal council in 1519.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} In 1520, Mikl\u00f3s Kapornay, Abbot of Zalav\u00e1r wrote in his document that Cs\u00e1nyi guaranteed the debt payment of the abbey to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Istv\u00e1n Terj\u00e9k, in exchange for the collateral of [[Zalav\u00e1r]] domain. On 3 July 1520, King Louis II commissioned Cs\u00e1nyi, among others, to investigate the report of the Buda Chapter, which complained that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kanizsai's soldiers attacked its serfs in the chapel estates of [[Zalakaros|Karos]] and [[Galambok]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} From 17 September 1520 to 1527, Cs\u00e1nyi served as vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County for the second (or third) time.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=252}} Meanwhile, he functioned as ''isp\u00e1n'' (or head) of the chamber of salt in [[Transylvania]] in 1523, as his own charter claimed. He held that position, when his relative, the influential Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny de Cs\u00e9b held the dignity of ''isp\u00e1n'' of chamber of salt in [[M\u00e1ramaros County|M\u00e1ramaros]] (today [[Maramure\u0219]], [[Romania]]).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\nCs\u00e1nyi did not participate in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], where his relatives, Ambrus S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny and Zsigmond Pog\u00e1ny were killed. He held the office of vice-''isp\u00e1n'' of Zala County until 1527. In that year, he represented his county alongside Istv\u00e1n Gyulafi and D\u00e9nes H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi at the Diet of [[Buda]] which was convened by [[John Z\u00e1polya]].{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2000|p=241}} Following that Cs\u00e1nyi gradually retired from public life. On 1 January 1529, he bought lands in Als\u00f3kust\u00e1n from local noble L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Holl\u00f3si. A county ''dicalis'' of 1531 listed Cs\u00e1nyi's property: 12 ''porta''s in Cs\u00e1ny and 16 ''porta''s in [[Vindornyasz\u0151l\u0151s]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}} In his last years, he was ''familiar'' to the powerful [[N\u00e1dasdy family]] alongside his brother and sons. According to an undated letter of his son \u00c1kos to his lord [[Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy]], his father Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi and two of his brothers, Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of a plague which had broken out following the Ottoman campaign and the [[Siege of G\u00fcns|Siege of K\u0151szeg]] in the summer of 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}}\n\n==Family==\nBased on a document of fragmentary genealogical data from the early 16th century,{{sfn|Kubinyi|1984|p=263}} Ir\u00e9n Bilkei claimed that Cs\u00e1nyi married an unidentified lady from the S\u00e1rk\u00e1ny de \u00c1kosh\u00e1za family. A possession agreement in Somogy County from 1515 preserved his sons' names: Mikl\u00f3s, Istv\u00e1n, J\u00e1nos, Gergely and \u00c1kos. Two of them Istv\u00e1n and Gergely died of plague in 1532.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=17}} J\u00e1nos (V) was never mentioned again.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}} \u00c1kos, whose collection of 500 letters to Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy is one of the most important primary sources of the 16th-century Hungarian history, married Anna Sitkey, they had a daughter Orsolya. Later members of the Cs\u00e1nyi family descended from Mikl\u00f3s II (fl. 1500\u201341), who married L\u00facia Mar\u00e1czy.{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=20}} Bal\u00e1zs Cs\u00e1nyi also had daughters: Margit married John H\u00e1sh\u00e1gyi, as a document of 1554 from a [[Place of authentication]] recorded. His other unidentified daughter was the mother of Jakab Zele de Szentbal\u00e1zs, head of the court of Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy in [[Nagykanizsa|Kanizsa]].{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=15}}\n\nAt the county assembly of 9 December 1524, his niece Orsolya (daughter of Mikl\u00f3s I Cs\u00e1nyi and Veronika Rajki) filed a lawsuit against him for her mother's dowry and morning-gift. During the trial, the property of Cs\u00e1ny, Tilaj, Erd\u0151h\u00e1t e.g. were involved. There was a second trial in 1528 on the occasion of the [[last will and testament]] of Mikl\u00f3s I between Bal\u00e1zs and Orsolya Cs\u00e1nyi (who, by then, married G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Terj\u00e9k).{{sfn|Bilkei|2016|p=16}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bilkei |first=Ir\u00e9n |editor1-last=Bilkei |editor1-first=Ir\u00e9n |title=Zalai \u00e9vsz\u00e1zadok.

One of the main tourist attractions is the [[Kiama Blowhole]]. Kiama features several popular surfing beaches and caravan parks, and numerous alfresco cafes and restaurants. Its proximity to the south of Sydney makes it an attractive destination for many day-trippers and people wanting to stay numerous nights.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lighthouse, Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse at Kiama]]\nKiama was the site of two strong volcanic flows, called the Gerringong Volcanics, which came out of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]], now a collapsed volcanic vent. The Kiama Blowhole is part of an erosion process on the more recent rock, formed into columnar basalt, or [[latite]]. Before the cedar-getters (comprising ex-convicts, convicts and runaways, some with cedar licences and many without) arrived in the area around 1810, the local [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Wodi Wodi]] of the language group [[Dharawal]], had been using the land for thousands of years, moving every six weeks or so in family groups. This is supported by a midden of shells at nearby Bass Point used for more than 17,000 years. During this time the whole coastal hills was covered in rainforest and cedar brush. There is evidence of a flourishing culture with intricate possum cloaks, a developed song and story cycle, and a deep understanding of the many plants of the rainforest. Only a few remnants of rainforest survive along the escarpment in places like the Minnamurra Rainforest Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id%3DN0069%26s%3D20080510000000124 |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020104430/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id=N0069&s=20080510000000124 |title=Budderoo National Park |archivedate=20 October 2009 }}</ref>\nThere is strong evidence of recent sea debris showing a mega-tsunami hit this coast around 1487 A.D according to Dr Ted Bryant of Wollongong University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Tsunami Introduction \u2013 School of Earth and Environmental Sciences @ UOW|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321051744/http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |archivedate=21 March 2009 }}</ref> The first European to explore the area was [[George Bass]] who stopped there on 6 December 1797 and viewed Kiama's blowhole.\n\nDuring the early settlement of eastern Australia, the Kiama area was settled by wheat farmers, since the soil was volcanic and rain-swept unlike most of Australia. Early Jamberoo was the population centre from about 1830 to the 1860s and when the wheat failed to grow, the farmers switched to dairying. During this period Kiama became the best example of '[[chain migration]]' in Australia as many assisted migrants came from Northern Ireland on clearing leases and eventually half the marriages in the Kiama Anglican Church in a hundred years had Northern Irish Protestant ancestry. Kiama was one of the birthplaces of the Australian dairy industry with the first Dairy Factory ([[Kiama Pioneer Butter Factory|The Kiama Pioneer Factory]]) and first Dairy Co-operative in Australia. There were three original major land grants, Thomas Surfleet Kendall (son of lapsed missionary Reverend [[Thomas Kendall]]), Michael Hindmarsh and Matthew Cignarella, all of which married sisters of the Rutter family. The Kendalls were cousins of [[Henry Kendall (poet)|Henry Kendall]], the famous Australian poet. The Kendall name is remembered today in several places such as the spooky [[Kendall Cemetery]] in [[Kiama Heights]] and [[Kendalls Beach]]. The Hindmarshs are remembered in Kiama's main park, Hindmarsh Park, and after 10 generations still live on their original land.\n\nKiama's next population boom was powered by its quarries, which multiplied rapidly in the early years of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dunn\">{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Elaine M.|title=Kiama: Its region and community 1901 to 1938|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1644&context=theses&type=additional|website=ro.uow.edu.au|publisher=University of Wollongong|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Many Irish Catholics worked in the Kiama quarries.

Railway Quarry, and the remnants of earlier quarries are easily visible throughout the town and often have facilities built inside them such as the Kiama Leisure Centre. One particular quarry, the Bombo Headland, is of scientific importance as it is the site of the discovery of the longest known geomagnetic polarity interval called the [[Geomagnetic reversal#Superchrons|Kiaman Reverse Superchron]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.07.041|last=Cottrell|first=Rory D.|last2=Tarduno|first2=John A|last3=Roberts|first3=John|title=The Kiaman Reversed Polarity Superchron at Kiama: Toward a field strength estimate based on single silicate crystals|journal=[[Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors]]|volume=169|pages=49\u201358|year=2008|bibcode=2008PEPI..169...49C}}</ref>\n\nWhen Kiama Harbour was hollowed out after 17 years' work, and flooded in 1876, larger steamers such as from the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company could enter and a flourishing sea trade followed. Staithes for loading crushed [[Construction aggregate|blue metal stone]] directly into ships from rail trucks were installed along the eastern end of the harbour, allowing regular shipments to be taken to Sydney for the railways and road construction. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage was finished in 1881 and the Kiama Lighthouse in 1887. Kiama really hit its boom time in this period, from 1890 until the Great Depression in 1927, when many of the quarries closed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It was a prosperous and happy time well recorded in the local newspaper, the Kiama Independent and the photographs of the Cocks Photographic Studio, two valuable resources which tell most of the Kiama story.\n\nOver time tourism and housing growth turned Kiama into a dormitory suburb (where people travelled away to work) and summer tourist spot. Kiama in 2009 is a tourism haven in summer, during which its population triples. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage is now a local history museum. Nearby, on Black Beach, is a memorial to the blue metal freighter [[SS Bombo]], which capsized and sank outside [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] harbour in a huge gale after departing Kiama for Sydney on 24 February 1949. Twelve of the fourteen crew were lost.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nKiama has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 24\u201340 and 42\u201344 Collins Street: [[Collins Street wooden terraces, Kiama]]<ref name=nswshr-472>{{cite NSW SHR|5045308|Wooden Terraces|hr=00472|fn=EF14/4793; S90/2611; HC 33091|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-473>{{cite NSW SHR|5045333|Wooden Terraces|hr=00473|fn=EF14/4793; HC33091, 9870|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 46 Collins Street: [[Kiama Masonic Temple]]<ref name=nswshr-474>{{cite NSW SHR|5045312|Masonic Temple|hr=00474|fn=HC 33091, 9869|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Illawarra railway: [[Kiama railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1176>{{cite NSW SHR|5012065|Kiama Railway Station Group and Turntable|hr=01176|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Irvine Street: [[Kiama Reservoirs]]<ref name=nswshr-1626>{{cite NSW SHR|5053864|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0231)|hr=01626|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1627>{{cite NSW SHR|5053865|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0232)|hr=01627|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 16\u201320 Manning Street: [[CBC Bank Building, Kiama|CBC Bank Building]]<ref name=nswshr-143>{{cite NSW SHR|5045696|CBC Bank (former)|hr=00143|fn=S90/05746 & HC 32558|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Shoalhaven Street: [[Scots Presbyterian Church, Kiama|Scots Presbyterian Church]]<ref name=nswshr-120>{{cite NSW SHR|5045566|Scots Presbyterian Church, Land and Trees|hr=00120|fn=S90/06026 & HC 32269|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 24 Terralong Street: [[Kiama Post Office]]<ref name=nswshr-1426>{{cite NSW SHR|5051275|Kiama Post Office|hr=01426|fn=H00/00203|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Kiama area includes many attractions, being situated on the coast south of the [[Minnamurra River]], and to the west lie the foothills of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] and the smaller less discernible peak of Mount Brandon.

Kiama is also known as the place where the mountains touch the sea.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/downloads/southcoast/kiama_ramps_apx_e_urban_design_report.pdf Kiama Ramps additional access ramps Apx E \u2013 Visual assessment and urban design strategy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is in reference to the [[Kiama Blowhole]] which attracts many visitors annually. The \"Little Blowhole\" is a lesser known blowhole as it does not share the same central location or the scale associated with the larger [[Kiama Blowhole]]. The Little Blowhole is on a headland south of the central part of Kiama between Easts and Kendalls Beaches.\n\nBoth have areas for viewing, though the Kiama Blowhole attracts more tourists. A coastal walking track currently allows people to walk from Minnamurra to Easts Beach, past both blowholes. A 7 kilometre southern extension to this path has been opened to allow people to walk along the cliffs to [[Gerringong, New South Wales|Gerringong]].\n\nA few kilometres north at Bombo is Cathedral Rocks, a formation well known and visited, with a walk/cycleway going along the Kiama coast. There are other rock formations on these cliff headlands of moderate renown.\n\nThe Kiama Post Office, one of many historic buildings, is known for its history and pink colour, although it was repainted in 2012. It is situated near Black Beach.\n\nKiama has a strip mall of caf\u00e9s, restaurants, art galleries and shops on Terralong Street. Also on this street is a war memorial, an historic fire station used for exhibits, and a small shopping centre. There is a strong arts following and interest in cultural events in Kiama, and in 2013 an arts trail was introduced to showcase the work of individual artists, together with regular arts events in the area. Food and wine trails are also becoming more popular in the area.\n\n[[Kiama Light]]house, on Blowhole Point, was built in 1887<ref>{{cite loa|NSW|Kiama|The Kiama Lighthouse}}</ref> and is situated close to the Kiama Blowhole. The point also contains a heritage pilot's cottage and a tourist information centre. North West of the Blowhole is Kiama Harbour, home to fishing boats and seafood market where you can buy local fish. The point also contains seaside cabins and a wonderful rock pool.\n\nA locally famous phenomenon is the local group of Australian [[Pelican]]s. The pelicans have been honoured with a metal statue at the harbour.\n\nSeven kilometres southwest of the town is Saddleback Lookout atop the 600-metre high [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] with views over the [[Illawarra Plains]] and escarpment and south to Nowra, Pigeon House Mountain and Coolangatta Mountain. Saddleback and Noorinan mountains provide an impressive backdrop to the city.\n\nThe [[Jamberoo Action Park]], a mainly ride-orientated water-themed park, is situated 10 minutes inland of Kiama in the small town of Jamberoo.\n\nWest of Kiama in the green hills lies Jerrara Dam, built in the 1800s to supply water to the area. It is now a reserve.\n\nNorth of the [[Minnamurra River]] is [[Killalea Recreation Area]], a nature reserve on Bass Point. It is south of [[Shellharbour, New South Wales|Shellharbour]].\n\nKiama Council spent eleven years preparing the construction of the Kiama Coast Walk, a six-kilometre track extending from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon, near Gerringong, south of Kiama. Some coastal land was declared public reserve to allow the public to walk through what was previously private property. The track was scheduled to open in October 2009 and was expected to be a popular drawcard for the public.<ref>Daily Telegraph, 4 September 2009, p.30</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nKiama is home to several schools, including [[Kiama High School]], [[Kiama Public School]] and [[Ss Peter and Paul Catholic School]]. Two vocational education and training (VET) providers also have their headquarters in Kiama, the Kiama Community College and National Training Masters. The local [[TAFE NSW]] College is located at [[Shellharbour]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cathedral Rock, Kiama from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|Cathedral Rock, Kiama, circa 1900\nFile:Kiama

One of the main tourist attractions is the [[Kiama Blowhole]]. Kiama features several popular surfing beaches and caravan parks, and numerous alfresco cafes and restaurants. Its proximity to the south of Sydney makes it an attractive destination for many day-trippers and people wanting to stay numerous nights.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lighthouse, Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse at Kiama]]\nKiama was the site of two strong volcanic flows, called the Gerringong Volcanics, which came out of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]], now a collapsed volcanic vent. The Kiama Blowhole is part of an erosion process on the more recent rock, formed into columnar basalt, or [[latite]]. Before the cedar-getters (comprising ex-convicts, convicts and runaways, some with cedar licences and many without) arrived in the area around 1810, the local [[Indigenous Australians]], [[Wodi Wodi]] of the language group [[Dharawal]], had been using the land for thousands of years, moving every six weeks or so in family groups. This is supported by a midden of shells at nearby Bass Point used for more than 17,000 years. During this time the whole coastal hills was covered in rainforest and cedar brush. There is evidence of a flourishing culture with intricate possum cloaks, a developed song and story cycle, and a deep understanding of the many plants of the rainforest. Only a few remnants of rainforest survive along the escarpment in places like the Minnamurra Rainforest Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id%3DN0069%26s%3D20080510000000124 |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020104430/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkSector.aspx?id=N0069&s=20080510000000124 |title=Budderoo National Park |archivedate=20 October 2009 }}</ref>\nThere is strong evidence of recent sea debris showing a mega-tsunami hit this coast around 1487 A.D according to Dr Ted Bryant of Wollongong University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Tsunami Introduction \u2013 School of Earth and Environmental Sciences @ UOW|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |accessdate=12 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321051744/http://www.uow.edu.au/science/eesc/research/UOW002909.html |archivedate=21 March 2009 }}</ref> The first European to explore the area was [[George Bass]] who stopped there on 6 December 1797 and viewed Kiama's blowhole.\n\nDuring the early settlement of eastern Australia, the Kiama area was settled by wheat farmers, since the soil was volcanic and rain-swept unlike most of Australia. Early Jamberoo was the population centre from about 1830 to the 1860s and when the wheat failed to grow, the farmers switched to dairying. During this period Kiama became the best example of '[[chain migration]]' in Australia as many assisted migrants came from Northern Ireland on clearing leases and eventually half the marriages in the Kiama Anglican Church in a hundred years had Northern Irish Protestant ancestry. Kiama was one of the birthplaces of the Australian dairy industry with the first Dairy Factory ([[Kiama Pioneer Butter Factory|The Kiama Pioneer Factory]]) and first Dairy Co-operative in Australia. There were three original major land grants, Thomas Surfleet Kendall (son of lapsed missionary Reverend [[Thomas Kendall]]), Michael Hindmarsh and Matthew Cignarella, all of which married sisters of the Rutter family. The Kendalls were cousins of [[Henry Kendall (poet)|Henry Kendall]], the famous Australian poet. The Kendall name is remembered today in several places such as the spooky [[Kendall Cemetery]] in [[Kiama Heights]] and [[Kendalls Beach]]. The Hindmarshs are remembered in Kiama's main park, Hindmarsh Park, and after 10 generations still live on their original land.\n\nKiama's next population boom was powered by its quarries, which multiplied rapidly in the early years of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Dunn\">{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Elaine M.|title=Kiama: Its region and community 1901 to 1938|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=0&article=1644&context=theses&type=additional|website=ro.uow.edu.au|publisher=University of Wollongong|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> Many Irish Catholics worked in the Kiama quarries.

One particular quarry, the Bombo Headland, is of scientific importance as it is the site of the discovery of the longest known geomagnetic polarity interval called the [[Geomagnetic reversal#Superchrons|Kiaman Reverse Superchron]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.07.041|last=Cottrell|first=Rory D.|last2=Tarduno|first2=John A|last3=Roberts|first3=John|title=The Kiaman Reversed Polarity Superchron at Kiama: Toward a field strength estimate based on single silicate crystals|journal=[[Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors]]|volume=169|pages=49\u201358|year=2008|bibcode=2008PEPI..169...49C}}</ref>\n\nWhen Kiama Harbour was hollowed out after 17 years' work, and flooded in 1876, larger steamers such as from the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company could enter and a flourishing sea trade followed. Staithes for loading crushed [[Construction aggregate|blue metal stone]] directly into ships from rail trucks were installed along the eastern end of the harbour, allowing regular shipments to be taken to Sydney for the railways and road construction. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage was finished in 1881 and the Kiama Lighthouse in 1887. Kiama really hit its boom time in this period, from 1890 until the Great Depression in 1927, when many of the quarries closed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It was a prosperous and happy time well recorded in the local newspaper, the Kiama Independent and the photographs of the Cocks Photographic Studio, two valuable resources which tell most of the Kiama story.\n\nOver time tourism and housing growth turned Kiama into a dormitory suburb (where people travelled away to work) and summer tourist spot. Kiama in 2009 is a tourism haven in summer, during which its population triples. The Kiama Pilot's Cottage is now a local history museum. Nearby, on Black Beach, is a memorial to the blue metal freighter [[SS Bombo]], which capsized and sank outside [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] harbour in a huge gale after departing Kiama for Sydney on 24 February 1949. Twelve of the fourteen crew were lost.\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nKiama has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 24\u201340 and 42\u201344 Collins Street: [[Collins Street wooden terraces, Kiama]]<ref name=nswshr-472>{{cite NSW SHR|5045308|Wooden Terraces|hr=00472|fn=EF14/4793; S90/2611; HC 33091|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-473>{{cite NSW SHR|5045333|Wooden Terraces|hr=00473|fn=EF14/4793; HC33091, 9870|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 46 Collins Street: [[Kiama Masonic Temple]]<ref name=nswshr-474>{{cite NSW SHR|5045312|Masonic Temple|hr=00474|fn=HC 33091, 9869|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Illawarra railway: [[Kiama railway station]]<ref name=nswshr-1176>{{cite NSW SHR|5012065|Kiama Railway Station Group and Turntable|hr=01176|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Irvine Street: [[Kiama Reservoirs]]<ref name=nswshr-1626>{{cite NSW SHR|5053864|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0231)|hr=01626|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=nswshr-1627>{{cite NSW SHR|5053865|Kiama Reservoir (WS 0232)|hr=01627|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 16\u201320 Manning Street: [[CBC Bank Building, Kiama|CBC Bank Building]]<ref name=nswshr-143>{{cite NSW SHR|5045696|CBC Bank (former)|hr=00143|fn=S90/05746 & HC 32558|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* Shoalhaven Street: [[Scots Presbyterian Church, Kiama|Scots Presbyterian Church]]<ref name=nswshr-120>{{cite NSW SHR|5045566|Scots Presbyterian Church, Land and Trees|hr=00120|fn=S90/06026 & HC 32269|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n* 24 Terralong Street: [[Kiama Post Office]]<ref name=nswshr-1426>{{cite NSW SHR|5051275|Kiama Post Office|hr=01426|fn=H00/00203|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Kiama area includes many attractions, being situated on the coast south of the [[Minnamurra River]], and to the west lie the foothills of [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] and the smaller less discernible peak of Mount Brandon. Also to the west is the town of [[Jamberoo, New South Wales|Jamberoo]] with pasture-land in between, which contains many historic buildings and [[dry stone wall]]s. Also of note is [[Seven Mile Beach, New South Wales|Seven Mile Beach]] to the south, a protected reserve. Kiama has several well-known surfing beaches, including Surf Beach, 'Mystics' and Boyds' Beach, as well as other more protected swimming beaches situated in coves between headlands such as Black Beach, Easts Beach and Kendalls Beach. Kiama Harbour forms one of several coves between headlands.\n\n===Climate===\nKiama is the southern edge of the [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfa''), being the southernmost city entirely in this climatic zone<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-australia-new-zealand.php|title=Interactive Australia / New Zealand Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> with warm summers and mild winters.

By road, Kiama is about 55 minutes from the southern edge of Sydney, and 100 minutes from the city centre, via the [[Princes Highway]].\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Kiama Town Council.jpg|thumb|the Town Council of Kiama]]\n[[File:Memorial Arch in Kiama, NSW.jpg|thumb|Memorial Arch]]\n[[File:Post office in Kiama, New South Wales.jpg|thumb|Post office]]\n[[File:Kiama Harbour.jpg|thumb|View of Kiama Harbour from Black Beach]]\n\nThe beaches around Kiama offer a large range of surfing conditions. Many surfing competitions are held here every year. These include Boyds Beach \u2013 [[Kiama Downs]], Bombo Beach \u2013 [[Bombo, New South Wales|Bombo]], Surf Beach \u2013 Kiama, Easts Beach and Caravan Park \u2013 Kiama Heights, Kendalls Beach \u2013 Kiama and Mystics Beach \u2013 [[Minnamurra River]].\n\nThe name \"Kiama\" is derived from the [[Aborgine language|Aboriginal word]] \"''kiarama''\", which means \"Place where the sea makes a noise\". Kiama is also known as the place where the mountains touch the sea.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/downloads/southcoast/kiama_ramps_apx_e_urban_design_report.pdf Kiama Ramps additional access ramps Apx E \u2013 Visual assessment and urban design strategy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is in reference to the [[Kiama Blowhole]] which attracts many visitors annually. The \"Little Blowhole\" is a lesser known blowhole as it does not share the same central location or the scale associated with the larger [[Kiama Blowhole]]. The Little Blowhole is on a headland south of the central part of Kiama between Easts and Kendalls Beaches.\n\nBoth have areas for viewing, though the Kiama Blowhole attracts more tourists. A coastal walking track currently allows people to walk from Minnamurra to Easts Beach, past both blowholes. A 7 kilometre southern extension to this path has been opened to allow people to walk along the cliffs to [[Gerringong, New South Wales|Gerringong]].\n\nA few kilometres north at Bombo is Cathedral Rocks, a formation well known and visited, with a walk/cycleway going along the Kiama coast. There are other rock formations on these cliff headlands of moderate renown.\n\nThe Kiama Post Office, one of many historic buildings, is known for its history and pink colour, although it was repainted in 2012. It is situated near Black Beach.\n\nKiama has a strip mall of caf\u00e9s, restaurants, art galleries and shops on Terralong Street. Also on this street is a war memorial, an historic fire station used for exhibits, and a small shopping centre. There is a strong arts following and interest in cultural events in Kiama, and in 2013 an arts trail was introduced to showcase the work of individual artists, together with regular arts events in the area. Food and wine trails are also becoming more popular in the area.\n\n[[Kiama Light]]house, on Blowhole Point, was built in 1887<ref>{{cite loa|NSW|Kiama|The Kiama Lighthouse}}</ref> and is situated close to the Kiama Blowhole. The point also contains a heritage pilot's cottage and a tourist information centre. North West of the Blowhole is Kiama Harbour, home to fishing boats and seafood market where you can buy local fish. The point also contains seaside cabins and a wonderful rock pool.\n\nA locally famous phenomenon is the local group of Australian [[Pelican]]s. The pelicans have been honoured with a metal statue at the harbour.\n\nSeven kilometres southwest of the town is Saddleback Lookout atop the 600-metre high [[Saddleback Mountain (New South Wales)|Saddleback Mountain]] with views over the [[Illawarra Plains]] and escarpment and south to Nowra, Pigeon House Mountain and Coolangatta Mountain. Saddleback and Noorinan mountains provide an impressive backdrop to the city.\n\nThe [[Jamberoo Action Park]], a mainly ride-orientated water-themed park, is situated 10 minutes inland of Kiama in the small town of Jamberoo.\n\nWest of Kiama in the green hills lies Jerrara Dam, built in the 1800s to supply water to the area. It is now a reserve.\n\nNorth of the [[Minnamurra River]] is [[Killalea Recreation Area]], a nature reserve on Bass Point. It is south of [[Shellharbour, New South Wales|Shellharbour]].\n\nKiama Council spent eleven years preparing the construction of the Kiama Coast Walk, a six-kilometre track extending from Loves Bay, north of Kiama, to Werri Lagoon, near Gerringong, south of Kiama. Some coastal land was declared public reserve to allow the public to walk through what was previously private property. The track was scheduled to open in October 2009 and was expected to be a popular drawcard for the public.<ref>Daily Telegraph, 4 September 2009, p.30</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nKiama is home to several schools, including [[Kiama High School]], [[Kiama Public School]] and [[Ss Peter and Paul Catholic School]]. Two vocational education and training (VET) providers also have their headquarters in Kiama, the Kiama Community College and National Training Masters. The local [[TAFE NSW]] College is located at [[Shellharbour]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cathedral Rock, Kiama from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|Cathedral Rock, Kiama, circa 1900\nFile:Kiama harbour 1.JPG|Kiama harbour\nFile:Kiama harbour 2.JPG|Kiama harbour\nFile:Kiama post office.jpg|Kiama post office\n\n</gallery>\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[David Balding|Prof David Balding]] (born 10 March 1961), Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor of Statistical Genomics at the University of Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/statisticalgenomics/|title=University of Melbourne|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.science.org.au/profile/david-balding|title=David Balding, Australian Academy of Science|last=|first=|date=|website=www.science.org.au|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n*[[Peter Knott]] (born 8 August 1956) represented Gilmore from 1993 to 1996 for the Australian Labor Party (ALP).\n* [[Matt Brown (Australian politician)|Matt Brown]] (born 1972), member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for Kiama<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Mr (Matt) Matthew James Brown \n |work=Members of Parliament \n |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] \n |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/Members.nsf/d890a06557517cedca256e700008765e/0e9604ed2e89485b4a256760000caa06?OpenDocument \n |accessdate=12 February 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329115229/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/Members.nsf/d890a06557517cedca256e700008765e/0e9604ed2e89485b4a256760000caa06?OpenDocument \n |archivedate=29 March 2010 \n}}</ref>\n<!-- *Harold Percival \"Percy\" Christmas, founder of [[Woolworths Limited]]-->\n* [[Charmian Clift]] (1923\u20131969), writer and essayist<ref>{{cite book|author=Wheatley, N.|year=2001|title=The Life and Myth of Charmian Clift|publisher=Flamingo (Harper Collins)|location=Sydney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLN5NQAACAAJ}}</ref>\n<!--* [[Australia's Next Top Model, Cycle 4|Alyce Crawford (model)]]-->\n*Sir [[George Fuller (Australian politician)|George Fuller]] (1861\u20131940), [[Premier of New South Wales]]<ref>{{cite NSW Parliament| title =Sir George Warburton Fuller (1861\u20131940) |id=1075 |former=Yes |accessdate=16 June 2019 }}</ref>\n* [[Orry George Kelly]] (1897\u20131964), Academy Award-winning dress designer<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140703b.htm Kelly, Orry George biography] at the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]</ref>\n* [[Robbie Maddison]] (born 1981), [[freestyle motocross]] rider{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n* [[Josh Morris (rugby)|Josh Morris]] and [[Brett Morris]], professional rugby league players\n* Alfred Percival (Perce) Bullen<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bullen-alfred-percival-perce-9621|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|website = }}</ref> (1896\u20131974), circus proprietor\n* Charles Edward Devenish Meares<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/meares-charles-edward-devenish-7548|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|website = }}</ref> (1861\u20131940), dairy industry organiser\n* Frederick Phillimore Howell-Price<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/howell-price-frederick-phillimore-7073|title = Australian Dictionary of Biography|website = }}</ref> (1888\u20131978) soldier\n*[[Joseph Carruthers]], Premier of NSW, born in Kiama 1857\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Kiama, New South Wales}}\n*[http://www.kiama.nsw.gov.au/ Kiama Municipal Council website]\n\n{{Municipality of Kiama suburbs |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Kiama]]\n[[Category:Kiama, New South Wales| ]]\n[[Category:Coastal towns in New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiama,_New_South_Wales"}
