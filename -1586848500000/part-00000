Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 pm [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals, and the final were held at 6:00 pm CST.\n\nThis event was the lightest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 48 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 pm [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals, and the final were held at 6:00 pm CST.\n\nThis event was the lightest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 48 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Tournament results==\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Mobile app", "text_new": "{{for|Wikipedia's mobile apps|Help:Mobile access#Applications|selfref=true}}\n{{pp|small=yes}}\nA '''mobile application''', also referred to as a '''mobile app''' or simply an '''app''', is a [[computer program]] or [[software application]] designed to run on a [[mobile device]] such as a [[smartphone|phone]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], or [[smartwatch|watch]]. Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as [[mobile games]], factory automation, GPS and [[location-based services]], order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available. Apps are generally downloaded from application distribution platforms which are operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the [[App Store (iOS)]] or [[Google Play Store]]. Some apps are free, and others have a price, with the profit being split between the application's creator and the distribution platform. Mobile applications often stand in contrast to [[desktop application]]s which are designed to run on [[desktop computer]]s, and [[web application]]s which run in [[mobile web browser]]s rather than directly on the mobile device.\n\nIn 2009, technology columnist [[David Pogue]] stated that smartphones could be nicknamed \"app phones\" to distinguish them from earlier less-sophisticated smartphones.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/technology/personaltech/05pogue.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Place to Put Your Apps|last=Pogue|first=David|date=November 4, 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> The term \"app\", short for \"software application\", has since become very popular; in 2010, it was listed as \"[[Word of the Year]]\" by the [[American Dialect Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americandialect.org/app-voted-2010-word-of-the-year-by-the-american-dialect-society-updated |title=\"App\" voted 2010 word of the year by the American Dialect Society (UPDATED) American Dialect Society |publisher=Americandialect.org |date=2011-01-08 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nMost mobile devices are sold with several apps bundled as pre-installed software, such as a [[web browser]], [[email client]], [[Calendaring software|calendar]], mapping program, and an app for [[Mobile music|buying music]], other media, or more apps. Some pre-installed apps can be removed by an ordinary uninstall process, thus leaving more storage space for desired ones. Where the software does not allow this, some devices can be [[Rooting (Android OS)|rooted]] to eliminate the undesired apps.\n\nApps that are not preinstalled are usually available through distribution platforms called [[app store]]s. They began appearing in 2008 and are typically operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], [[Google Play]], [[Windows Phone Store]], and [[BlackBerry App World]]. However, there are independent app stores, such as [[Cydia]], [[GetJar]] and [[F-Droid]]. Some apps are free, while others must be bought. Usually, they are downloaded from the platform to a target device, but sometimes they can be downloaded to [[laptop]]s or [[desktop computer]]s. For apps with a price, generally a percentage, 20-30%, goes to the distribution provider (such as [[iTunes]]), and the rest goes to the producer of the app.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/06/11/analyst-theres-a-great-future-in-iphone-apps/ |title=Analyst: There's a great future in iPhone apps |last=Siegler |first=MG |work=Venture Beat |date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> The same app can, therefore, cost a different price depending on the mobile platform.\n\nApps can also be installed manually, for example by running an [[Android application package]] on Android devices.\n\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Official Army iPhone app.jpg|thumb|The official [[US Army]] iPhone app presents the service's technology news, updates and media in a single place]]\nMobile apps were originally offered for general productivity and information retrieval, including email, [[electronic calendar|calendar]], contacts, the stock market and weather information. However, public demand and the availability of developer tools drove rapid expansion into other categories, such as those handled by desktop [[application software]] packages. As with other software, the explosion in number and variety of apps made discovery a challenge, which in turn led to the creation of a wide range of review, recommendation, and curation sources, including blogs, magazines, and dedicated online app-discovery services. In 2014 government regulatory agencies began trying to regulate and curate apps, particularly medical apps.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C3LC51235E |pmid=24425070 |title=The regulation of mobile medical applications |journal=Lab on a Chip |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=833\u201340 |year=2014 |last1=Yetisen |first1=Ali Kemal |last2=Martinez-Hurtado |first2=J.

A common scheme is to distinguish native, hybrid, and web-based apps.\n\n=== Native app===\nAll apps targeted toward a particular mobile platform are known as native apps. Therefore, an app intended for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] device does not run in [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. As a result, most businesses develop apps for multiple platforms.\n\nWhile developing native apps, professionals incorporate best-in-class user interface modules. This accounts for better performance, consistency and good user experience. Users also benefit from wider access to [[application programming interface]]s and make limitless use of all apps from the particular device. Further, they also switch over from one app to another effortlessly.\n\nThe main purpose for creating such apps is to ensure best performance for a specific mobile operating system.\n\n=== Hybrid app ===\nThe concept of the hybrid app is a mix of native and web-based apps. Apps developed using [[Apache Cordova]], Xamarin, React Native, Sencha Touch and other similar technology fall into this category.\n\nThese are made to support web and native technologies across multiple platforms. Moreover, these apps are easier and faster to develop. It involves use of single code base which works in multiple mobile operating systems.\n\nDespite such advantages, hybrid apps exhibit lower performance. Often, apps fail to bear the same look-and-feel in different mobile operating systems.\n\n=== Web-based app ===\nA web-based app is coded in [[HTML5]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] or [[JavaScript]]. Internet access is required for proper behavior and user-experience of this group of apps.\n\nThese apps may capture minimum memory space in user devices compared to native and hybrid apps. Since all the personal databases are saved on the Internet servers, users can fetch their desired data from any device through the Internet.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Mobile application development}}\n[[File:Mistory - Demola, 2015.05.22 (5).JPG|thumb|Developers at work]]\nDeveloping apps for mobile devices requires considering the constraints and features of these devices. Mobile devices run on battery and have less powerful [[CPU|processors]] than personal computers and also have more features such as location detection and cameras. Developers also have to consider a wide array of screen sizes, hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms (although these issues can be overcome with mobile device detection).\n\nMobile application development requires the use of specialized [[integrated development environment]]s. Mobile apps are first tested within the development environment using [[emulator]]s and later subjected to field testing. Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=J.|last2=Bai|first2=X.|last3=Tsai|first3=W.|last4=Uehara|first4=T.|date=February 2014|title=Mobile Application Testing: A Tutorial|journal=Computer|volume=47|issue=2|pages=46\u201355|doi=10.1109/MC.2013.445|issn=0018-9162}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nMobile [[user interface]] (UI) Design is also essential. Mobile UI considers constraints and contexts, screen, input and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand. Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is primarily for an understandable, user-friendly interface.\n\nMobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems.  The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of [[middleware]] components including [[Mobile App Server|mobile app servers]], [[Mobile Backend as a service]] (MBaaS), and [[service-oriented architecture|SOA]] infrastructure.\n\nConversational interfaces display the computer interface and present interactions through text instead of graphic elements. They emulate conversations with real humans.<ref name=\"Fastcodesign\">{{cite web|last1=Brownlee|first1=John|title=Conversational Interfaces, Explained|url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/3058546/conversational-interfaces-explained|website=Fast Co.

The strategy is meant to off-set the security risk of a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) work strategy. When an employee brings a personal device into an enterprise setting, mobile application management enables the corporate IT staff to transfer required applications, control access to business data, and remove locally cached business data from the device if it is lost, or when its owner no longer works with the company. [[Operating-system-level virtualization|Containerization]] is an alternate BYOD security solution. Rather than controlling an employees entire device, containerization apps create isolated and secure pockets separate from all personal data. Company control of the device only extends to that separate container.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taware|first1=Varun|title=Containerization is a winning strategy for smarter BYOD management|url=http://betanews.com/2015/04/20/containerization-is-a-winning-strategy-for-smarter-byod-management/|website=Betanews|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===App wrapping vs. native app management===\nEspecially when employees \"[[bring your own device]]\", mobile apps can be a significant security risk for businesses, because they transfer unprotected sensitive data to the Internet without knowledge and consent of the users. Reports of stolen corporate data show how quickly corporate and personal data can fall into the wrong hands. Data theft is not just the loss of confidential information, but makes companies vulnerable to attack and blackmail.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rob|first1=Thomas|title=Energy Smart Mobile app|url=http://mobileapp-development.com/case-studies/energy-smart-mobile-app/|website=mobileapp-development.com|publisher=Case Study|location=United Kingdom|date=8 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nProfessional mobile application management helps companies protect their data.

Apps were originally intended for productivity assistance such as email, calendar, and contact databases, but the public demand for apps caused rapid expansion into other areas such as [[mobile games]], factory automation, GPS and [[location-based services]], order-tracking, and ticket purchases, so that there are now millions of apps available. Apps are generally downloaded from application distribution platforms which are operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the [[App Store (iOS)]] or [[Google Play Store]]. Some apps are free, and others have a price, with the profit being split between the application's creator and the distribution platform. Mobile applications often stand in contrast to [[desktop application]]s which are designed to run on [[desktop computer]]s, and [[web application]]s which run in [[mobile web browser]]s rather than directly on the mobile device.\n\nIn 2009, technology columnist [[David Pogue]] stated that smartphones could be nicknamed \"app phones\" to distinguish them from earlier less-sophisticated smartphones.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/technology/personaltech/05pogue.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Place to Put Your Apps|last=Pogue|first=David|date=November 4, 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> The term \"app\", short for \"software application\", has since become very popular; in 2010, it was listed as \"[[Word of the Year]]\" by the [[American Dialect Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americandialect.org/app-voted-2010-word-of-the-year-by-the-american-dialect-society-updated |title=\"App\" voted 2010 word of the year by the American Dialect Society (UPDATED) American Dialect Society |publisher=Americandialect.org |date=2011-01-08 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nMost mobile devices are sold with several apps bundled as pre-installed software, such as a [[web browser]], [[email client]], [[Calendaring software|calendar]], mapping program, and an app for [[Mobile music|buying music]], other media, or more apps. Some pre-installed apps can be removed by an ordinary uninstall process, thus leaving more storage space for desired ones. Where the software does not allow this, some devices can be [[Rooting (Android OS)|rooted]] to eliminate the undesired apps.\n\nApps that are not preinstalled are usually available through distribution platforms called [[app store]]s. They began appearing in 2008 and are typically operated by the owner of the [[mobile operating system]], such as the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], [[Google Play]], [[Windows Phone Store]], and [[BlackBerry App World]]. However, there are independent app stores, such as [[Cydia]], [[GetJar]] and [[F-Droid]]. Some apps are free, while others must be bought. Usually, they are downloaded from the platform to a target device, but sometimes they can be downloaded to [[laptop]]s or [[desktop computer]]s. For apps with a price, generally a percentage, 20-30%, goes to the distribution provider (such as [[iTunes]]), and the rest goes to the producer of the app.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/06/11/analyst-theres-a-great-future-in-iphone-apps/ |title=Analyst: There's a great future in iPhone apps |last=Siegler |first=MG |work=Venture Beat |date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> The same app can, therefore, cost a different price depending on the mobile platform.\n\nApps can also be installed manually, for example by running an [[Android application package]] on Android devices.\n\n[[File:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Official Army iPhone app.jpg|thumb|The official [[US Army]] iPhone app presents the service's technology news, updates and media in a single place]]\nMobile apps were originally offered for general productivity and information retrieval, including email, [[electronic calendar|calendar]], contacts, the stock market and weather information.

A common scheme is to distinguish native, hybrid, and web-based apps.\n\n=== Native app===\nAll apps targeted toward a particular mobile platform are known as native apps. Therefore, an app intended for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] device do not run in [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. As a result, most businesses develop apps for multiple platforms.\n\nWhile developing native apps, professionals incorporate best-in-class user interface modules. This accounts for better performance, consistency and good user experience. Users also benefit from wider access to [[application programming interface]]s and make limitless use of all apps from the particular device. Further, they also switch over from one app to another effortlessly.\n\nThe main purpose for creating such apps is to ensure best performance for a specific mobile operating system.\n\n=== Hybrid app ===\nThe concept of the hybrid app is a mix of native and web-based apps. Apps developed using [[Apache Cordova]], Xamarin, React Native, Sencha Touch and other similar technology fall into this category.\n\nThese are made to support web and native technologies across multiple platforms. Moreover, these apps are easier and faster to develop. It involves use of single code base which works in multiple mobile operating systems.\n\nDespite such advantages, hybrid apps exhibit lower performance. Often, apps fail to bear the same look-and-feel in different mobile operating systems.\n\n=== Web-based app ===\nA web-based app is coded in [[HTML5]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] or [[JavaScript]]. Internet access is required for proper behavior and user-experience of this group of apps.\n\nThese apps may capture minimum memory space in user devices compared to native and hybrid apps. Since all the personal databases are saved on the Internet servers, users can fetch their desired data from any device through the Internet.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Mobile application development}}\n[[File:Mistory - Demola, 2015.05.22 (5).JPG|thumb|Developers at work]]\nDeveloping apps for mobile devices requires considering the constraints and features of these devices. Mobile devices run on battery and have less powerful [[CPU|processors]] than personal computers and also have more features such as location detection and cameras. Developers also have to consider a wide array of screen sizes, hardware specifications and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes within each of the platforms (although these issues can be overcome with mobile device detection).\n\nMobile application development requires the use of specialized [[integrated development environment]]s. Mobile apps are first tested within the development environment using [[emulator]]s and later subjected to field testing. Emulators provide an inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have physical access.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=J.|last2=Bai|first2=X.|last3=Tsai|first3=W.|last4=Uehara|first4=T.|date=February 2014|title=Mobile Application Testing: A Tutorial|journal=Computer|volume=47|issue=2|pages=46\u201355|doi=10.1109/MC.2013.445|issn=0018-9162}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nMobile [[user interface]] (UI) Design is also essential. Mobile UI considers constraints and contexts, screen, input and mobility as outlines for design. The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation. Mobile UI design constraints include limited attention and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand. Mobile UI contexts signal cues from user activity, such as location and scheduling that can be shown from user interactions within a mobile application. Overall, mobile UI design's goal is primarily for an understandable, user-friendly interface.\n\nMobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems.  The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of [[middleware]] components including [[Mobile App Server|mobile app servers]], [[Mobile Backend as a service]] (MBaaS), and [[service-oriented architecture|SOA]] infrastructure.\n\nConversational interfaces display the computer interface and present interactions through text instead of graphic elements. They emulate conversations with real humans.<ref name=\"Fastcodesign\">{{cite web|last1=Brownlee|first1=John|title=Conversational Interfaces, Explained|url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/3058546/conversational-interfaces-explained|website=Fast Co.

The strategy is meant to off-set the security risk of a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) work strategy. When an employee brings a personal device into an enterprise setting, mobile application management enables the corporate IT staff to transfer required applications, control access to business data, and remove locally cached business data from the device if it is lost, or when its owner no longer works with the company. [[Operating-system-level virtualization|Containerization]] is an alternate BYOD security solution. Rather than controlling an employees entire device, containerization apps create isolated and secure pockets separate from all personal data. Company control of the device only extends to that separate container.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taware|first1=Varun|title=Containerization is a winning strategy for smarter BYOD management|url=http://betanews.com/2015/04/20/containerization-is-a-winning-strategy-for-smarter-byod-management/|website=Betanews|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===App wrapping vs. native app management===\nEspecially when employees \"[[bring your own device]]\", mobile apps can be a significant security risk for businesses, because they transfer unprotected sensitive data to the Internet without knowledge and consent of the users.

When a friend visited him in Malaysia, Anthony heard his friend complaining about the horrible experience of riding taxis in the country. In particular, his friend was concerned that his taxis may be taking an incorrect route or overcharging him. Taking inspiration from [[Garrett Camp]]'s ride sharing concept, Anthony decided to take this problem up as a project while studying at Harvard Business School. When he presented the project to his professors, the comments he received were that this project was \"difficult to implement\" despite the success of other ride hailing services in the U.S. such as [[Uber]]. The project won second place at the Business Plan Contest at Harvard Business School.<ref name= \"Anthony HBS\">{{cite web|title=Anthony Tan \u2013 MBA 2011|url=https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195|publisher=Havard Business School|accessdate=11 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111220026/https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195|archivedate=11 January 2018}}</ref> The app was also selected as the finalist at Harvard's Minimum Viable Product Funding award.<ref name=\"e27 Anthony Tan\">{{cite web|url=http://e27.co/first-venture-11-says-anthony-tan-traded-comics/|title=My first venture was at 11, says Anthony Tan, who traded comics then|last=Kumar|first=Dhaleta Surender|publisher=e27|date=11 February 2014|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Anthony Tan quit his position as the head-of-marketing of his family business Tan Chong Motors at [[Kuala Lumpur]]<ref name=\"Bloomberg 2014\"/> and launched the \"My Teksi\" app in Malaysia (known as \"GrabTaxi\" in other countries) together with [[Tan Hooi Ling]], another Harvard graduate.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes2014\">{{cite web|last=Cheong|first=Kash|url=http://www.straitstimes.com:80/digital-life/more-digital-life-stories/story/grabtaxi-currently-the-most-prominent-third-party-taxi-|title=GrabTaxi: Currently the most prominent third-party taxi app in the region|publisher=The Straits Times|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=17 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052128/http://www.straitstimes.com:80/digital-life/more-digital-life-stories/story/grabtaxi-currently-the-most-prominent-third-party-taxi-|archivedate=8 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tan Hooi Ling, Anthony's classmate, who was also a consultant at [[McKinsey & Company]], drew a business plan for promoting the mobile app.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bland|first=Ben|url=http://newsletters.isb.edu/FamilyBusiness-Newsletter/File/From-the-Press-Southeast-Asias-answer-to-Uber.pdf|title=Southeast Asia\u2019s answer to Uber|publisher=FT.com|date=24 June 2014|accessdate=20 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102045752/http://newsletters.isb.edu/FamilyBusiness-Newsletter/File/From-the-Press-Southeast-Asias-answer-to-Uber.pdf|archivedate=2 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> MyTeksi was launched with initial grant of US$25,000 from Harvard Business school and Anthony Tan's personal capital.<ref name= \"Anthony HBS\"/> Anthony Tan became the CEO of the company.

When a friend visited him in Malaysia, Anthony heard his friend complaining about the horrible experience of riding taxis in the country. In particular, his friend was concerned that his taxis may be taking an incorrect route or overcharging him. Taking inspiration from [[Garrett Camp]]'s ride sharing concept, Anthony decided to take this problem up as a project while studying at Harvard Business School. When he presented the project to his professors, the comments he received were that this project was \"difficult to implement\" despite the success of other ride hailing services in the U.S. such as [[Uber]]. The project won second place at the Business Plan Contest at Harvard Business School.<ref name= \"Anthony HBS\">{{cite web|title=Anthony Tan \u2013 MBA 2011|url=https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195|publisher=Havard Business School|accessdate=11 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111220026/https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195|archivedate=11 January 2018}}</ref> The app was also selected as the finalist at Harvard's Minimum Viable Product Funding award.<ref name=\"e27 Anthony Tan\">{{cite web|url=http://e27.co/first-venture-11-says-anthony-tan-traded-comics/|title=My first venture was at 11, says Anthony Tan, who traded comics then|last=Kumar|first=Dhaleta Surender|publisher=e27|date=11 February 2014|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Anthony Tan quit his position as the head-of-marketing of his family business Tan Chong Motors at [[Kuala Lumpur]]<ref name=\"Bloomberg 2014\"/> and launched the \"My Teksi\" app in Malaysia (known as \"GrabTaxi\" in other countries) together with [[Tan Hooi Ling]], another Harvard graduate.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes2014\">{{cite web|last=Cheong|first=Kash|url=http://www.straitstimes.com:80/digital-life/more-digital-life-stories/story/grabtaxi-currently-the-most-prominent-third-party-taxi-|title=GrabTaxi: Currently the most prominent third-party taxi app in the region|publisher=The Straits Times|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=17 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052128/http://www.straitstimes.com:80/digital-life/more-digital-life-stories/story/grabtaxi-currently-the-most-prominent-third-party-taxi-|archivedate=8 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tan Hooi Ling, Anthony's classmate, who was also a consultant at [[McKinsey & Company]], drew a business plan for promoting the mobile app.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bland|first=Ben|url=http://newsletters.isb.edu/FamilyBusiness-Newsletter/File/From-the-Press-Southeast-Asias-answer-to-Uber.pdf|title=Southeast Asia\u2019s answer to Uber|publisher=FT.com|date=24 June 2014|accessdate=20 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102045752/http://newsletters.isb.edu/FamilyBusiness-Newsletter/File/From-the-Press-Southeast-Asias-answer-to-Uber.pdf|archivedate=2 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> MyTeksi was launched with initial grant of US$25,000 from Harvard Business school and Anthony Tan's personal capital.<ref name= \"Anthony HBS\"/> Anthony Tan became the CEO of the company.

It was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear weapon design laboratory at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in [[New Mexico]], home of the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the first [[atomic weapons]]. [[Edward Teller]] and [[Ernest Lawrence]], director of the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, are regarded as the co-founders of the Livermore facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/about/history |title=History |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe new laboratory was sited at a former [[Naval Air Station Livermore|naval air station]] of [[World War&nbsp;II]].  It  was already home to several UC Radiation Laboratory projects that were too large for its location in the [[Berkeley Hills]] above the UC campus, including one of the first experiments in the magnetic approach to confined thermonuclear reactions (i.e. fusion). About half an hour southeast of Berkeley, the Livermore site provided much greater security for classified projects than an urban university campus.\n\nLawrence tapped his former graduate student [[Herbert York]], age 32, to run Livermore. Under York, the Lab had four main programs: [[Project Sherwood]] (the magnetic-fusion program), Project Whitney (the weapons-design program), diagnostic weapon experiments (both for the Los Alamos and Livermore laboratories), and a basic physics program. York and the new lab embraced the Lawrence \"big science\" approach, tackling challenging projects with physicists, chemists, engineers, and computational scientists working together in multidisciplinary teams. Lawrence died in August 1958 and shortly after, the university's board of regents named both laboratories for him, as the '''Lawrence Radiation Laboratory'''.\n\nHistorically, the Berkeley and Livermore laboratories have had very close relationships on research projects, business operations, and staff. The Livermore Lab was established initially as a branch of the Berkeley laboratory. The Livermore lab was not officially severed administratively from the Berkeley lab until 1971. To this day, in official planning documents and records, [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] is designated as Site 100, Lawrence Livermore National Lab as Site 200, and LLNL's remote test location as Site 300.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://str.llnl.gov/content/pages/past-issues-pdfs/1998.09.pdf |last=Hacker |first=Bart |title=A Short History of the Laboratory at Livermore |journal=Science and Technology Review |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |date=September 1998 |pages=12\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Renaming===\nThe laboratory was renamed '''Lawrence Livermore Laboratory''' ('''LLL''') in 1971. On October 1, 2007 LLNS assumed management of LLNL from the University of California, which had exclusively managed and operated the Laboratory since its inception 55 years before. The laboratory was honored in 2012 by having the synthetic chemical element [[livermorium]] named after it. The LLNS takeover of the laboratory has been controversial.  In May 2013, an Alameda County jury awarded over $2.7 million to five former laboratory employees who were among 430 employees LLNS laid off during 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uncertain Legal Future: $2.7 Million Awarded To Former Lab Employees |first=Jeff |last=Garberson |date=May 17, 2013 |work=[[The Independent (Livermore)|The Independent]] |location=Livermore, California |url=https://www.independentnews.com/news/uncertain-legal-future-million-awarded-to-former-lab-employees/article_48170ce4-be5d-11e2-8f6e-0019bb2963f4.html}}</ref>  The jury found that LLNS breached a contractual obligation to terminate the employees only for \"reasonable cause.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Laid Off Lab Workers Awarded $2.8 Million |url=https://www.law.com/therecorder/almID/1202599755147/ |first=Max |last=Taves |date=May 10, 2013 |work=The Recorder |publisher=[[ALM (company)|ALM]]}}</ref>  The five plaintiffs also have pending age discrimination claims against LLNS, which will be heard by a different jury in a separate trial.<ref name=\"Bob Egelko\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Livermore-lab-jury-awards-2-7-million-4512448.php |title=Livermore lab jury awards $2.7 million |first=Bob |last=Egelko |date=May 13, 2013 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>  There are 125 co-plaintiffs awaiting trial on similar claims against LLNS.<ref>{{cite news |title=Five Former Livermore Workers Receive $2.7 Million in Layoff Case |first=Todd |last=Jacobson |date=May 17, 2013 |work=Nuclear Weapons & Materials Monitor |publisher=ExchangeMonitor Publications}}</ref>  The May 2008 layoff was the first layoff at the laboratory in nearly 40 years.<ref name=\"Bob Egelko\"/>\n\nOn March 14, 2011, the City of Livermore officially expanded the city's boundaries to annex LLNL and move it within the city limits. The unanimous vote by the Livermore city council expanded Livermore's southeastern boundaries to cover 15 land parcels covering {{convert|1,057|acre|km2}} that comprise the LLNL site. The site was formerly an unincorporated area of Alameda County. The LLNL campus continues to be owned by the federal government.\n\n==Major projects==\n===Nuclear weapons===\nFrom its inception, Livermore focused on new weapon design concepts; as a result, its first three [[nuclear test]]s were unsuccessful. The lab persevered and its subsequent designs proved increasingly successful. In 1957, the Livermore Lab was selected to develop the warhead for the Navy's [[Polaris missile]]. This warhead required numerous innovations to fit a nuclear warhead into the relatively small confines of the missile nosecone.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike | website=Global Security | title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: Miniaturization | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/miniaturization.htm | date=April 27, 2005 | accessdate=June 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], many Livermore-designed [[warhead]]s entered service. These were used in missiles ranging in size from the [[MGM-52 Lance|Lance]] surface-to-surface tactical missile to the megaton-class [[LIM-49A Spartan|Spartan antiballistic missile]]. Over the years, LLNL designed the following warheads: [[Mark 27 nuclear bomb|W27]] (Regulus cruise missile; 1955; joint with Los Alamos), [[W38]] (Atlas/Titan ICBM; 1959), [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] (B52 bomb; 1957), [[W45]] (Little John/Terrier missiles; 1956), [[W47]] (Polaris SLBM; 1957), [[W48]] (155-mm howitzer; 1957), [[W55]] (submarine rocket; 1959), [[W56]] (Minuteman ICBM; 1960), [[W58]] (Polaris SLBM; 1960), [[W62]] (Minuteman ICBM; 1964), [[W68]] (Poseidon SLBM; 1966), [[W70]] (Lance missile; 1969), [[W71]] (Spartan missile; 1968), [[W79]] (8-in. artillery gun; 1975), [[W82]] (155-mm howitzer; 1978), [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]] (modern strategic bomb; 1979), and [[W87]] (Peacekeeper/MX ICBM; 1982). The W87 and the B83 are the only LLNL designs still in the U.S. nuclear stockpile.<ref>{{cite web |first=Carey |last=Sublette | title=Complete List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons | url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html | work=The Nuclear Weapon Archive | date=October 14, 2006 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Carey |last=Sublette | title=U.S. Nuclear Weapon Enduring Stockpile | url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Wpngall.html | work=The Nuclear Weapon Archive | date=August 31, 2007 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship | url=http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/missions/nwss.jsp | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date=February 13, 2008 | accessdate=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920124117/https://www.llnl.gov/llnl/missions/nwss.jsp |archive-date=September 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 and the end of the [[Cold War]], the United States began a moratorium on nuclear testing and development of new nuclear weapon designs. To sustain existing warheads for the indefinite future, a science-based [[Stockpile stewardship|Stockpile Stewardship]] Program (SSP) was defined that emphasized the development and application of greatly improved technical capabilities to assess the safety, security, and reliability of existing nuclear warheads without the use of nuclear testing. Confidence in the performance of weapons, without nuclear testing, is maintained through an ongoing process of stockpile surveillance, assessment and certification, and refurbishment or weapon replacement.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nWith no new designs of nuclear weapons, the warheads in the U.S. stockpile must continue to function far past their original expected lifetimes. As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but they also can introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the [[Reliable Replacement Warhead]] (RRW) Program. RRW designs could reduce uncertainties, ease maintenance demands, and enhance safety and security. In March 2007, the LLNL design was chosen for the Reliable Replacement Warhead.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Lindlaw |title=Bush Administration Picks Lawrence Livermore Warhead Design |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/02/state/n091011S16.DTL |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031319/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F02%2Fstate%2Fn091011S16.DTL |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> Since that time, Congress has not allocated funding for any further development of the RRW.\n\n===Plutonium research===\nLLNL conducts research into the properties and behavior of [[plutonium]] to learn how plutonium performs as it ages and how it behaves under high pressure (e.g., with the impact of high explosives). Plutonium has seven temperature-dependent solid [[allotropy|allotropes]]. Each possesses a different density and [[crystal structure]]. Alloys of plutonium are even more complex; multiple phases can be present in a sample at any given time. Experiments are being conducted at LLNL and elsewhere to measure the structural, electrical and chemical properties of plutonium and its alloys and to determine how these materials change over time. Such measurements will enable scientists to better model and predict plutonium's long-term behavior in the aging stockpile.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://str.llnl.gov/content/pages/past-issues-pdfs/2001.03.pdf |last=Parker |first=Ann |date=March 2001 |pages=23\u201325 |title=Plutonium Up Close ...

Work with highly enriched uranium is also conducted here. In March 2008, the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA) presented its preferred alternative for the transformation of the nation's nuclear weapons complex. Under this plan, LLNL would be a center of excellence for nuclear design and engineering, a center of excellence for high explosive research and development, and a science magnet in high-energy-density (i.e., laser) [[physics]]. In addition, most of its special nuclear material would be removed and consolidated at a more central, yet-to-be-named site.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Fact Sheet for NNSA Complex Transformation \u2013 Preferred Alternative |url=http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/defense_programs/documents/LivermoreFactSheet_v8.pdf |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030827/http://nnsa.energy.gov/defense_programs/documents/LivermoreFactSheet_v8.pdf |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 30, 2009, the NNSA announced that about two thirds of the special nuclear material (e.g., plutonium) at LLNL requiring the highest level of security protection had been removed from LLNL. The move was part of NNSA's efforts initiated in October 2006 to consolidate special nuclear material at five sites by 2012, with significantly reduced square footage at those sites by 2017. The federally mandated project intends to improve security and reduce security costs, and is part of NNSA's overall effort to transform the Cold War era \"nuclear weapons\" enterprise into a 21st-century \"nuclear security\" enterprise. The original date to remove all high-security nuclear material from LLNL, based on equipment capability and capacity, was 2014. NNSA and LLNL developed a timeline to remove this material as early as possible, accelerating the target completion date to 2012.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/2628.htm |date=September 30, 2009 |title=NNSA Ships Additional Special Nuclear Material from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as Part of Deinventory Project |publisher=[[National Nuclear Security Administration]]}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Global security program===\nThe Lab's work in global security aims to reduce and mitigate the dangers posed by the spread or use of weapons of mass destruction and by threats to energy and environmental security.

This petawatt-class laser is used for a range of high-[[energy density]] physics experiments, including the science of fast ignition for [[inertial confinement fusion]] energy.\n\n==Largest computers==\nThroughout its history, LLNL has been a leader in computers and scientific computing. Even before the Livermore Lab opened its doors, E.O. Lawrence and Edward Teller recognized the importance of computing and the potential of computational simulation. Their purchase of one of the first UNIVAC computers set the precedent for LLNL's history of acquiring and exploiting the fastest and most capable supercomputers in the world. A succession of increasingly powerful and fast computers have been used at the Lab over the years. LLNL researchers use supercomputers to answer questions about subjects such as materials science simulations, [[global warming]], and reactions to natural disasters.\n\nLLNL has a long history of developing computing [[software]] and systems. Initially, there was no commercially available software, and computer manufacturers considered it the customer's responsibility to develop their own. Users of the early computers had to write not only the codes to solve their technical problems, but also the routines to run the machines themselves. Today, LLNL computer scientists focus on creating the highly complex physics models, visualization codes, and other unique applications tailored to specific research requirements. A great deal of software also has been written by LLNL personnel to optimize the operation and management of the computer systems, including operating system extensions such as [[CHAOS (Linux Clustering)]] and resource management packages such as [[SLURM]].<ref>{{cite web | title=SLURM: A Highly Scalable Resource Manager | url=https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/ | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | accessdate=February 28, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527193633/https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/ | archive-date=May 27, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref> LLNL also initiated and continues leading the development of ZFS on Linux, the official port of [[ZFS]] to the [[Linux]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Toponce |first1=Aaron |title=Install ZFS on Debian GNU/Linux |url=https://pthree.org/2012/04/17/install-zfs-on-debian-gnulinux/ |website=pthree.org |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ZFS on Linux |url=https://zfsonlinux.org/ |website=ZFS on Linux |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Livermore Valley Open Campus (LVOC)==\nIn August 2009 a joint venture was announced between [[Sandia National Laboratories]]/California campus and LLNL to create an open, unclassified research and development space called the Livermore Valley Open Campus (LVOC). The motivation for the LVOC stems from current and future national security challenges that require increased coupling to the private sector to understand threats and deploy solutions in areas such as high performance computing, energy and environmental security, cyber security, economic security, and non-proliferation.\n\nThe LVOC is modeled after research and development campuses found at major industrial research parks and other U.S. Department of Energy laboratories with campus-like security, a set of business and operating rules devised to enhance and accelerate international scientific collaboration and partnerships with U.S. government agencies, industry and academia. Ultimately, the LVOC will consist of an approximately 110-acre parcel along the eastern edge of the Livermore Laboratory and Sandia sites, and will house additional conference space, collaboration facilities and a visitor's center to support educational and research activities.\n\nObjectives of LVOC\n\n*Enhance the two laboratories' national security missions by substantially increasing engagement with the private sector and academic community.\n*Stay at the forefront of the science, technology and engineering fields.\n*Ensure a quality future workforce by expanding opportunities for open engagement of the broader scientific community.\n\n==Sponsors==\nLLNL's  principal sponsor is the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]/[[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (DOE/NNSA) Office of Defense Programs, which supports its [[stockpile stewardship]] and advanced scientific computing programs. Funding to support LLNL's [[global security]] and [[homeland security]] work comes from the DOE/NNSA Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, as well as the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. LLNL also receives funding from DOE's [[Office of Science]], Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, and [[Office of Nuclear Energy]]. In addition, LLNL conducts work-for-others research and development for various [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] sponsors, other federal agencies, including [[NASA]], [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC), [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], a number of California State agencies, and private industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Budget==\nFor Fiscal Year 2009 LLNL spent $1.497 billion<ref>{{cite web|url=https://annual.llnl.gov/annual09/excellence/pdf/2009AnnualReport.pdf |title=2009 Annual Report |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> on research and laboratory operations activities:\n\nResearch/Science Budget:\n*[[National Ignition Facility]] \u2013 $301.1 million\n*Nuclear Weapon Deterrent (Safety/Security/Reliability) \u2013 $227.2 million\n*Advance Simulation and Computing \u2013 $221.9 million\n*Nonproliferation \u2013 $152.2 million\n*Department of Defense \u2013 $125.9 million\n*Basic and Applied Science \u2013 $86.6 million\n*Homeland Security \u2013 $83.9 million\n*Energy \u2013 $22.4 million\n\nSite Management/Operations Budget:\n*Safeguards/Security \u2013 $126.5 million\n*Facility Operations \u2013 $118.2 million\n*Environmental Restoration \u2013 $27.3 million\n\n==Directors==\nThe LLNL Director is appointed by the board of governors of Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS) and reports to the board.

The LLNS Board of Governors has a total of 16 positions, with six of these Governors constituting an Executive Committee. All decisions of the Board are made by the Governors on the Executive Committee. The other Governors are advisory to the Executive Committee and do not have voting rights.\n\nThe University of California is entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Chair. Bechtel is also entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Vice Chair. One of the Bechtel Governors must be a representative of Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) or the Washington Division of URS Corporation (URS), who is nominated jointly by B&W and URS each year, and who must be approved and appointed by Bechtel. The Executive Committee has a seventh Governor who is appointed by Battelle; they are non-voting and advisory to the Executive Committee. The remaining Board positions are known as Independent Governors (also referred to as Outside Governors), and are selected from among individuals, preferably of national stature, and can not be employees or officers of the partner companies.\n\nThe University of California-appointed Chair has tie-breaking authority over most decisions of the Executive Committee. The Board of Governors is the ultimate governing body of LLNS and is charged with overseeing the affairs of LLNS in its operations and management of LLNL.\n\nLLNS managers and employees who work at LLNL, up to and including the President/Laboratory Director, are generally referred to as Laboratory Employees. All Laboratory Employees report directly or indirectly to the LLNS President. While most of the work performed by LLNL is funded by the federal government, Laboratory employees are paid by LLNS which is responsible for all aspects of their employment including providing health care benefits and retirement programs.\n\nWithin the Board of Governors, authority resides in the Executive Committee to exercise all rights, powers, and authorities of LLNS, excepting only certain decisions that are reserved to the parent companies. The LLNS Executive Committee is free to appoint officers or other managers of LLNS and LLNL, and may delegate its authorities as it deems appropriate to such officers, employees, or other representatives of LLNS/LLNL. The Executive Committee may also retain auditors, attorneys, or other professionals as necessary. For the most part the Executive Committee has appointed senior managers at LLNL as the primary officers of LLNS. As a practical matter most operational decisions are delegated to the President of LLNS, who is also the Laboratory Director.  The positions of President/Laboratory Director and Deputy Laboratory Director are filled by joint action of the Chair and Vice Chair of the Executive Committee, with the University of California nominating the President/Laboratory Director and Bechtel nominating the Deputy Laboratory Director.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/ac.labguide.0807.pdf |last1=Eklund |first1=Bill |last2=Oakley |first2=John |date=August 31, 2007 |title=An Introductory Guide to UC's Ties to LANS LLC and LLNS LLC and their Management of the Weapons Labs at Los Alamos and Livermore |publisher=University of California |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528040814/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/ac.labguide.0807.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe current LLNS Chairman is [[Norman J.

Originally a branch of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], the Lawrence Livermore laboratory became autonomous in 1971 and was designated a national laboratory in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.aip.org/phn/21612012.html|title=Lawrence Livermore Laboratory|website=Physics History Network |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |access-date=August 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center]] (FFRDC), Lawrence Livermore lab is primarily funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) and managed and operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), a partnership of the University of California, [[Bechtel]], [[BWX Technologies]], [[AECOM]], and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] in affiliation with the [[Texas A&M University System]].  In 2012, the laboratory had the synthetic chemical element [[livermorium]] (element 116) named after it.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:LLNL Aerial View.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]\nLLNL is self-described as \"a premier [[research and development]] institution for science and technology applied to [[national security]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Missions | url=http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/missions | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date=February 13, 2008 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}</ref> Its principal responsibility is ensuring the safety, security and reliability of the nation's [[nuclear weapon]]s through the application of advanced science, engineering and technology. The Laboratory also applies its special expertise and multidisciplinary capabilities to preventing the [[wikt:proliferation|proliferation]] and use of [[weapons of mass destruction]], bolstering [[homeland security]] and solving other nationally important problems, including [[energy]] and [[environmental security]], basic science and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe Laboratory is located on a one-square-mile (2.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) site at the eastern edge of Livermore. It also operates a {{convert|7000|acre|km2}} remote experimental test site, called Site 300, situated about {{convert|15|mi}} southeast of the main lab site. LLNL has an annual budget of about $1.5 billion and a staff of roughly 8,000 employees.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nLLNL was established in 1952 as the '''University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore''', an offshoot of the existing [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|UC Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley]].  It was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear weapon design laboratory at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in [[New Mexico]], home of the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the first [[atomic weapons]]. [[Edward Teller]] and [[Ernest Lawrence]], director of the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, are regarded as the co-founders of the Livermore facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/about/history |title=History |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe new laboratory was sited at a former [[Naval Air Station Livermore|naval air station]] of [[World War&nbsp;II]].  It  was already home to several UC Radiation Laboratory projects that were too large for its location in the [[Berkeley Hills]] above the UC campus, including one of the first experiments in the magnetic approach to confined thermonuclear reactions (i.e. fusion). About half an hour southeast of Berkeley, the Livermore site provided much greater security for classified projects than an urban university campus.\n\nLawrence tapped his former graduate student [[Herbert York]], age 32, to run Livermore. Under York, the Lab had four main programs: [[Project Sherwood]] (the magnetic-fusion program), Project Whitney (the weapons-design program), diagnostic weapon experiments (both for the Los Alamos and Livermore laboratories), and a basic physics program. York and the new lab embraced the Lawrence \"big science\" approach, tackling challenging projects with physicists, chemists, engineers, and computational scientists working together in multidisciplinary teams. Lawrence died in August 1958 and shortly after, the university's board of regents named both laboratories for him, as the '''Lawrence Radiation Laboratory'''.\n\nHistorically, the Berkeley and Livermore laboratories have had very close relationships on research projects, business operations, and staff. The Livermore Lab was established initially as a branch of the Berkeley laboratory. The Livermore lab was not officially severed administratively from the Berkeley lab until 1971. To this day, in official planning documents and records, [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] is designated as Site 100, Lawrence Livermore National Lab as Site 200, and LLNL's remote test location as Site 300.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://str.llnl.gov/content/pages/past-issues-pdfs/1998.09.pdf |last=Hacker |first=Bart |title=A Short History of the Laboratory at Livermore |journal=Science and Technology Review |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |date=September 1998 |pages=12\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Renaming===\nThe laboratory was renamed '''Lawrence Livermore Laboratory''' ('''LLL''') in 1971. On October 1, 2007 LLNS assumed management of LLNL from the University of California, which had exclusively managed and operated the Laboratory since its inception 55 years before. The laboratory was honored in 2012 by having the synthetic chemical element [[livermorium]] named after it. The LLNS takeover of the laboratory has been controversial.  In May 2013, an Alameda County jury awarded over $2.7 million to five former laboratory employees who were among 430 employees LLNS laid off during 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uncertain Legal Future: $2.7 Million Awarded To Former Lab Employees |first=Jeff |last=Garberson |date=May 17, 2013 |work=[[The Independent (Livermore)|The Independent]] |location=Livermore, California |url=https://www.independentnews.com/news/uncertain-legal-future-million-awarded-to-former-lab-employees/article_48170ce4-be5d-11e2-8f6e-0019bb2963f4.html}}</ref>  The jury found that LLNS breached a contractual obligation to terminate the employees only for \"reasonable cause.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Laid Off Lab Workers Awarded $2.8 Million |url=https://www.law.com/therecorder/almID/1202599755147/ |first=Max |last=Taves |date=May 10, 2013 |work=The Recorder |publisher=[[ALM (company)|ALM]]}}</ref>  The five plaintiffs also have pending age discrimination claims against LLNS, which will be heard by a different jury in a separate trial.<ref name=\"Bob Egelko\">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Livermore-lab-jury-awards-2-7-million-4512448.php |title=Livermore lab jury awards $2.7 million |first=Bob |last=Egelko |date=May 13, 2013 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>  There are 125 co-plaintiffs awaiting trial on similar claims against LLNS.<ref>{{cite news |title=Five Former Livermore Workers Receive $2.7 Million in Layoff Case |first=Todd |last=Jacobson |date=May 17, 2013 |work=Nuclear Weapons & Materials Monitor |publisher=ExchangeMonitor Publications}}</ref>  The May 2008 layoff was the first layoff at the laboratory in nearly 40 years.<ref name=\"Bob Egelko\"/>\n\nOn March 14, 2011, the City of Livermore officially expanded the city's boundaries to annex LLNL and move it within the city limits. The unanimous vote by the Livermore city council expanded Livermore's southeastern boundaries to cover 15 land parcels covering {{convert|1,057|acre|km2}} that comprise the LLNL site. The site was formerly an unincorporated area of Alameda County. The LLNL campus continues to be owned by the federal government.\n\n==Major projects==\n===Nuclear weapons===\nFrom its inception, Livermore focused on new weapon design concepts; as a result, its first three [[nuclear test]]s were unsuccessful. The lab persevered and its subsequent designs proved increasingly successful. In 1957, the Livermore Lab was selected to develop the warhead for the Navy's [[Polaris missile]].

To sustain existing warheads for the indefinite future, a science-based [[Stockpile stewardship|Stockpile Stewardship]] Program (SSP) was defined that emphasized the development and application of greatly improved technical capabilities to assess the safety, security, and reliability of existing nuclear warheads without the use of nuclear testing. Confidence in the performance of weapons, without nuclear testing, is maintained through an ongoing process of stockpile surveillance, assessment and certification, and refurbishment or weapon replacement.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nWith no new designs of nuclear weapons, the warheads in the U.S. stockpile must continue to function far past their original expected lifetimes. As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but they also can introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the [[Reliable Replacement Warhead]] (RRW) Program. RRW designs could reduce uncertainties, ease maintenance demands, and enhance safety and security. In March 2007, the LLNL design was chosen for the Reliable Replacement Warhead.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Lindlaw |title=Bush Administration Picks Lawrence Livermore Warhead Design |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/02/state/n091011S16.DTL |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031319/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F02%2Fstate%2Fn091011S16.DTL |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> Since that time, Congress has not allocated funding for any further development of the RRW.\n\n===Plutonium research===\nLLNL conducts research into the properties and behavior of [[plutonium]] to learn how plutonium performs as it ages and how it behaves under high pressure (e.g., with the impact of high explosives).

This petawatt-class laser is used for a range of high-[[energy density]] physics experiments, including the science of fast ignition for [[inertial confinement fusion]] energy.\n\n==Largest computers==\nThroughout its history, LLNL has been a leader in computers and scientific computing. Even before the Livermore Lab opened its doors, E.O. Lawrence and Edward Teller recognized the importance of computing and the potential of computational simulation. Their purchase of one of the first UNIVAC computers set the precedent for LLNL's history of acquiring and exploiting the fastest and most capable supercomputers in the world. A succession of increasingly powerful and fast computers have been used at the Lab over the years. LLNL researchers use supercomputers to answer questions about subjects such as materials science simulations, [[global warming]], and reactions to natural disasters.\n\nLLNL has a long history of developing computing [[software]] and systems. Initially, there was no commercially available software, and computer manufacturers considered it the customer's responsibility to develop their own. Users of the early computers had to write not only the codes to solve their technical problems, but also the routines to run the machines themselves. Today, LLNL computer scientists focus on creating the highly complex physics models, visualization codes, and other unique applications tailored to specific research requirements. A great deal of software also has been written by LLNL personnel to optimize the operation and management of the computer systems, including operating system extensions such as [[CHAOS (Linux Clustering)]] and resource management packages such as [[SLURM]].<ref>{{cite web | title=SLURM: A Highly Scalable Resource Manager | url=https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/ | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | accessdate=February 28, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527193633/https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/ | archive-date=May 27, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref> LLNL also initiated and continues leading the development of ZFS on Linux, the official port of [[ZFS]] to the [[Linux]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Toponce |first1=Aaron |title=Install ZFS on Debian GNU/Linux |url=https://pthree.org/2012/04/17/install-zfs-on-debian-gnulinux/ |website=pthree.org |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ZFS on Linux |url=https://zfsonlinux.org/ |website=ZFS on Linux |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Livermore Valley Open Campus (LVOC)==\nIn August 2009 a joint venture was announced between [[Sandia National Laboratories]]/California campus and LLNL to create an open, unclassified research and development space called the Livermore Valley Open Campus (LVOC). The motivation for the LVOC stems from current and future national security challenges that require increased coupling to the private sector to understand threats and deploy solutions in areas such as high performance computing, energy and environmental security, cyber security, economic security, and non-proliferation.\n\nThe LVOC is modeled after research and development campuses found at major industrial research parks and other U.S. Department of Energy laboratories with campus-like security, a set of business and operating rules devised to enhance and accelerate international scientific collaboration and partnerships with U.S. government agencies, industry and academia. Ultimately, the LVOC will consist of an approximately 110-acre parcel along the eastern edge of the Livermore Laboratory and Sandia sites, and will house additional conference space, collaboration facilities and a visitor's center to support educational and research activities.\n\nObjectives of LVOC\n\n*Enhance the two laboratories' national security missions by substantially increasing engagement with the private sector and academic community.\n*Stay at the forefront of the science, technology and engineering fields.\n*Ensure a quality future workforce by expanding opportunities for open engagement of the broader scientific community.\n\n==Sponsors==\nLLNL's  principal sponsor is the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]/[[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (DOE/NNSA) Office of Defense Programs, which supports its [[stockpile stewardship]] and advanced scientific computing programs.

The LLNS Board of Governors has a total of 16 positions, with six of these Governors constituting an Executive Committee. All decisions of the Board are made by the Governors on the Executive Committee. The other Governors are advisory to the Executive Committee and do not have voting rights.\n\nThe University of California is entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Chair. Bechtel is also entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Vice Chair. One of the Bechtel Governors must be a representative of Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) or the Washington Division of URS Corporation (URS), who is nominated jointly by B&W and URS each year, and who must be approved and appointed by Bechtel. The Executive Committee has a seventh Governor who is appointed by Battelle; they are non-voting and advisory to the Executive Committee. The remaining Board positions are known as Independent Governors (also referred to as Outside Governors), and are selected from among individuals, preferably of national stature, and can not be employees or officers of the partner companies.\n\nThe University of California-appointed Chair has tie-breaking authority over most decisions of the Executive Committee. The Board of Governors is the ultimate governing body of LLNS and is charged with overseeing the affairs of LLNS in its operations and management of LLNL.\n\nLLNS managers and employees who work at LLNL, up to and including the President/Laboratory Director, are generally referred to as Laboratory Employees. All Laboratory Employees report directly or indirectly to the LLNS President. While most of the work performed by LLNL is funded by the federal government, Laboratory employees are paid by LLNS which is responsible for all aspects of their employment including providing health care benefits and retirement programs.\n\nWithin the Board of Governors, authority resides in the Executive Committee to exercise all rights, powers, and authorities of LLNS, excepting only certain decisions that are reserved to the parent companies. The LLNS Executive Committee is free to appoint officers or other managers of LLNS and LLNL, and may delegate its authorities as it deems appropriate to such officers, employees, or other representatives of LLNS/LLNL. The Executive Committee may also retain auditors, attorneys, or other professionals as necessary. For the most part the Executive Committee has appointed senior managers at LLNL as the primary officers of LLNS. As a practical matter most operational decisions are delegated to the President of LLNS, who is also the Laboratory Director.  The positions of President/Laboratory Director and Deputy Laboratory Director are filled by joint action of the Chair and Vice Chair of the Executive Committee, with the University of California nominating the President/Laboratory Director and Bechtel nominating the Deputy Laboratory Director.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/ac.labguide.0807.pdf |last1=Eklund |first1=Bill |last2=Oakley |first2=John |date=August 31, 2007 |title=An Introductory Guide to UC's Ties to LANS LLC and LLNS LLC and their Management of the Weapons Labs at Los Alamos and Livermore |publisher=University of California |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528040814/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/reports/ac.labguide.0807.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe current LLNS Chairman is [[Norman J.

Slive, who avoids the term (see p. 296), divides his book into two parts: 1600\u20131675 (294 pages) and 1675\u20131800 (32 pages).</ref> during and after the later part of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) for Dutch independence.\n\nThe new [[Dutch Republic]] was the most prosperous nation in Europe and led European trade, science, and art. The northern [[Terminology of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself.  The painting of religious subjects declined sharply, but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up.\n\nAlthough Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general European period of [[Baroque painting]], and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including [[Flemish Baroque painting|that of neighbouring Flanders]]. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed [[realism (arts)|realism]] inherited from [[Early Netherlandish painting]].\n[[File:Frans Hals 008.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Hals]]' [[tronie]], with the later title ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]''. 1628\u201330.

But, for example, [[still-life]] is also a genre in painting.</ref> with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then until the [[Rampjaar|French invasion of 1672]] is the core of Golden Age painting.  Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and often a particular sub-type within these categories.  Many of these types of subject were new in Western painting, and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development.\n\npainting\n\n==The art world==\n[[File:Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirck Hals]], genre scene of ''Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior''. Note the paintings on the wall of what appears to be a tavern; also [[commons:File:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Tailor's Workshop.jpg|here]].]]\n\nForeigners remarked on the enormous quantities of art produced and the large fairs where many paintings were sold \u2013 it has been roughly estimated that over 1.3 million Dutch pictures were painted in the 20 years after 1640 alone.<ref>Lloyd, 15, citing [[Jonathan Israel]]. Perhaps only 1% survive today, and \"only about 10% of these were of real quality\".</ref>  The volume of production meant that prices were fairly low, except for the best known artists; as in most subsequent periods, there was a steep price gradient for more fashionable artists.<ref>Franits, 2</ref> Those without a strong contemporary reputation, or who had fallen out of fashion, including many now considered among the greatest of the period, such as [[Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Rembrandt]] in his last years, had considerable problems earning a living, and died poor; many artists had other jobs, or abandoned art entirely.<ref>[[Jan Steen]] was an innkeeper, [[Aelbert Cuyp]] was one of many whose wealthy wives persuaded them to give up painting, although [[Karel Dujardin]] seems to have run away from his to continue his work. Conversely [[Jan van de Cappelle]] came from a very wealthy family, and [[Joachim Wtewael]] was a self-made [[flax]] tycoon. See their biographies in MacLaren. The fish artist [[Jacob Gillig]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qkW3ff-NRZoC&pg=PA208&dq=%22Jacob+Gillig%22#v=onepage&q=%22Jacob%20Gillig%22&f=false also worked as a warder in the Utrecht prison, conveniently close to the fish market.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813210431/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qkW3ff-NRZoC&pg=PA208&dq=%22Jacob+Gillig%22#v=onepage&q=%22Jacob%20Gillig%22&f=false |date=2018-08-13 }} Bankrupts included: Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan de Bray, and many others.</ref> In particular the French invasion of 1672 (the ''[[Rampjaar]]'', or \"year of disaster\"), brought a severe depression to the art market, which never quite returned to earlier heights.<ref>Franits, 217 and ff. on 1672 and its effects.</ref>\n\nThe distribution of pictures was very wide: \"yea many tymes, blacksmithes, cobblers etts., will have some picture or other by their Forge and in their stalle. Such is the generall Notion, enclination and delight that these Countrie Native have to Painting\" reported an English traveller in 1640.<ref>Fuchs, 43; Franits, 2 calls this \"oft-quoted\" remark \"undoubtedly exaggerated\".</ref>  There were for virtually the first time many professional art dealers, several also significant artists, like [[Vermeer]] and his father, [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Willem Kalf]]. Rembrandt's dealer [[Hendrick van Uylenburgh]] and his son [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh|Gerrit]] were among the most important.  Landscapes were the easiest uncommissioned works to sell, and their painters were the \"common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art\" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].<ref>Fuchs, 104</ref>\n\n[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|The Haarlem Painter's Guild]]'' in 1675, by  [[Jan de Bray]], whose self-portrait is the second from the left]]\n\nThe technical quality of Dutch artists was generally high, still mostly following the old medieval system of training by apprenticeship with a master.  Typically workshops were smaller than in Flanders or Italy, with only one or two apprentices at a time, the number often being restricted by guild regulations.  The turmoil of the early years of the Republic, with displaced artists from the South moving north and the loss of traditional markets in the court and church, led to a resurgence of artists guilds, often still called the [[Guild of Saint Luke]].  In many cases these involved the artists extricating themselves from medieval groupings where they shared a guild with several other trades, such as housepainting.  Several new guilds were established in the period: [[Amsterdam]] in 1579, [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|Haarlem]] in 1590, and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] between 1609 and 1611.<ref>Prak (2008), 151-153, or Prak (2003), 241</ref> The [[Leiden]] authorities distrusted guilds and did not allow one until 1648.<ref>Prak (2008), 153</ref>\n\nLater in the century it began to become clear to all involved that the old idea of a guild controlling both training and sales no longer worked well, and gradually the guilds were replaced with [[academies]], often only concerned with the training of artists.  [[The Hague]], with the court, was an early example, where artists split into two groups in 1656 with the founding of the [[Confrerie Pictura]].  With the obvious exception of portraits, many more Dutch paintings were done \"speculatively\" without a specific commission than was then the case in other countries \u2013 one of many ways in which the Dutch art market showed the future.<ref name=\"Fuchs, 43\">Fuchs, 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Gelder Selbstbildnis m h\u00e4sslicher Frau@St\u00e4del Museum Frankfurt20170818.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aert de Gelder]], ''Self-portrait as [[Zeuxis]]'' (1685)]]\n\nThere were many dynasties of artists, and many married the daughters of their masters or other artists. Many artists came from well-off families, who paid fees for their apprenticeships, and they often married into property. Rembrandt and Jan Steen were both enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]] for a while. Several cities had distinct styles and specialities by subject, but Amsterdam was the largest artistic centre, because of its great wealth.<ref>Franits' book is largely organized by city and by period; Slive by subject categories</ref>  Cities such as [[Haarlem]] and [[Utrecht]] were more important in the first half of the century, with [[Leiden]] and other cities emerging after 1648, and above all Amsterdam, which increasingly drew to it artists from the rest of the Netherlands, as well as [[Flanders]] and Germany.<ref>Franits throughout, summarized on p. 260</ref>\n\nDutch artists were strikingly less concerned about artistic theory than those of many nations, and less given to discussing their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy.<ref>Fuchs, 76</ref>  As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art was a source of national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are [[Karel van Mander]] (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and [[Arnold Houbraken]] (''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' \u2013 \"The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters\", 1718\u201321). Both followed, and indeed exceeded, [[Vasari]] in including a great number of short lives of artists \u2013 over 500 in Houbraken's case \u2013 and both are considered generally accurate on factual matters.\n\nThe German artist [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (1606\u20131688) had worked for periods in Holland, and his ''Deutsche Akademie'' in the same format covers many Dutch artists he knew. Houbraken's master, and Rembrandt's pupil, was [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]] (1627\u20131678), whose ''Zichtbare wereld'' and ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' (1678) contain more critical than biographical information, and are among the most important treatises on painting of the period. Like other Dutch works on the theory of art, they expound many commonplaces of Renaissance theory and do not entirely reflect contemporary Dutch art, still often concentrating on history painting.<ref>See Slive, 296-7 and elsewhere</ref>\n\n==History painting==\n[[File:Danae by Van Loo.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Loo]], ''[[Dana\u00eb]]'' (compare [[Dana\u00eb (Rembrandt painting)|Rembrandt's treatment]])]]\n\nThis category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past, but also paintings that showed biblical, mythological, literary and [[allegory|allegorical]] scenes. Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category, and were treated in a realist fashion, as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine, townscape or landscape subjects.<ref>Fuchs, 107</ref>  Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries, as there was no local market for church art, and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill. More than that, the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of [[Mannerist]] allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the [[Dutch Revolt]], which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric.<ref>Fuchs, 62, R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', \"Prologue\" pp.&nbsp;27\u201343, 1945, Faber, London</ref>  History painting was now a \"minority art\", although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjects<ref>Fuchs, 62-3</ref>\n\nMore than in other types of painting, Dutch history painters continued to be influenced by Italian painting. Prints and copies of Italian masterpieces circulated and suggested certain compositional schemes. The growing Dutch skill in the depiction of light was brought to bear on styles derived from Italy, notably that of [[Caravaggio]]. Some Dutch painters also travelled to Italy, though this was less common than with their Flemish contemporaries, as can be seen from the membership of the [[Bentvueghels]] club in Rome.<ref name=\"Fuchs, 43\"/>\n\n[[File:Dirk van Baburen - Kroning met de doornenkroon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Utrecht Caravaggism]]: [[Dirck van Baburen]], ''Christ crowned with thorns'', 1623, for a convent in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], not a market available in most of Holland.]]\n\nIn the early part of the century many [[Northern Mannerist]] artists with styles formed in the previous century continued to work, until the 1630s in the cases of [[Abraham Bloemaert]] and [[Joachim Wtewael]].<ref>Slive, 13-14</ref>  Many history paintings were small in scale, with the German painter (based in Rome) [[Adam Elsheimer]] as much an influence as Caravaggio (both died in 1610) on Dutch painters like [[Pieter Lastman]], Rembrandt's master, and Jan and [[Jacob Pynas]]. Compared to Baroque history painting from other countries, they shared the Dutch emphasis on realism, and narrative directness, and are sometimes known as the \"Pre-Rembrandtists\", as Rembrandt's early paintings were in this style.<ref>Fuchs, 62-69</ref>\n\n[[Utrecht Caravaggism]] describes a group of artists who produced both history painting and generally large genre scenes in an Italian-influenced style, often making heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. Utrecht, before the revolt the most important city in the new Dutch territory, was an unusual Dutch city, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-century, even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.<ref>Franits, 65. Catholic 17th-century Dutch artists included Abraham Bloemaert and Gerard van Honthorst from Utrecht, and Jan Steen, [[Paulus Bor]], [[Jacob van Velsen]], plus Vermeer who probably converted at his marriage.[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/catholic_church.html]  [[Jacob Jordaens]] was among Flemish Protestant artists.</ref>  The leading artists were [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerard van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], and the school was active about 1630, although van Honthorst continued until the 1650s as a successful court painter to the English, Dutch and Danish courts in a more classical style.<ref>Slive, 22-4</ref>\n\nRembrandt began as a history painter before finding financial success as a portraitist, and he never relinquished his ambitions in this area. A great number of his [[etching]]s are of narrative religious scenes, and the story of his last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.<ref>Fuchs, 69-77</ref>  Several artists, many his pupils, attempted with some success to continue his very personal style; [[Govaert Flinck]] was the most successful.  [[Gerard de Lairesse]] (1640\u20131711) was another of these, before falling under heavy influence from French classicism, and becoming its leading Dutch proponent as both artist and theoretician.<ref>Fuchs, 77-78</ref>\n\nNudity was effectively the preserve of the history painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did. For all their uninhibited suggestiveness, genre painters rarely revealed more than a generous cleavage or stretch of thigh, usually when painting prostitutes or \"Italian\" peasants.\n\n==Portraits==\n[[File:Portrait sophia trip wife of balthasar coymans.jpg|thumb|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''Sophia Trip'' (1645), a member of one of the wealthiest families in Holland.<ref>[http://www.beernink.com/articles/triptree.htm?timeline=off Trip family tree]. Her grandparents' various portraits by Rembrandt are famous.</ref>]]\n\nPortrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century, as there was a large mercantile class who were far more ready to commission portraits than their equivalents in other countries; a summary of various estimates of total production arrives at between 750,000 and 1,100,000 portraits.<ref>Ekkart, 17 n.1 (on p. 228).</ref>  Rembrandt enjoyed his greatest period of financial success as a young Amsterdam portraitist, but like other artists, grew rather bored with painting commissioned portraits of burghers: \"artists travel along this road without delight\", according to van Mander.<ref>Shawe-Taylor, 22-23, 32-33 on portraits, quotation from 33</ref>\n\nWhile Dutch portrait painting avoids the swagger and excessive rhetoric of the aristocratic Baroque portraiture current in the rest of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting ''en masse'', as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.\n\n[[File:Willem Heythuijsen by Frans Hals 1634.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frans Hals]], ''Willem Heythuijsen'' (1634), {{convert|47|x|37|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\n[[File:Van den Kerckhoven door Jan Mijtens.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johannes Mytens|Jan Mijtens]], family portrait, 1652, with the boys in \"picturesque\" dress.]]\n\nThe other great portraitist of the period is [[Frans Hals]], whose famously lively brushwork and ability to show sitters looking relaxed and cheerful adds excitement to even the most unpromising subjects. The extremely \"nonchalant pose\" of his portrait of Willem Heythuijsen is exceptional: \"no other portrait from this period is so informal\".<ref>Ekkart, 118</ref>  The sitter was a wealthy textile merchant who had already commissioned Hals' only individual life-sized full-length portrait ten years before. In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes.<ref>Ekkart, 130 and 114.</ref> [[Jan de Bray]] encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family. [[Thomas de Keyser]], [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], [[Ferdinand Bol]] and others, including many mentioned below as history or genre painters, did their best to enliven more conventional works. Portraiture, less affected by fashion than other types of painting, remained the safe fallback for Dutch artists.\n\nFrom what little we know of the studio procedures of artists, it seems that, as elsewhere in Europe, the face was probably drawn and perhaps painted at an initial sitting or two. The typical number of further sittings is unclear - between zero (for a Rembrandt full-length) and 50 appear documented. The clothes were left at the studio and might well be painted by assistants, or a brought-in specialist master, although, or because, they were regarded as a very important part of the painting.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 68-69</ref>  Married and never-married women can be distinguished by their dress, highlighting how few single women were painted, except in family groups.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 66-68</ref>  As elsewhere, the accuracy of the clothes shown is variable - striped and patterned clothes were worn, but artists rarely show them, understandably avoiding the extra work.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 73</ref> Lace and [[ruff]] collars were unavoidable, and presented a formidable challenge to painters intent on realism. Rembrandt evolved a more effective way of painting patterned lace, laying in broad white stokes, and then painting lightly in black to show the pattern. Another way of doing this was to paint in white over a black layer, and scratch off the white with the end of the brush to show the pattern.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 69-71</ref>\n\nAt the end of the century there was a fashion for showing sitters in a semi-fancy dress, begun in England by van Dyck in the 1630s, known as \"picturesque\" or \"Roman\" dress.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 72-73</ref>  Aristocratic, and militia, sitters allowed themselves more freedom in bright dress and expansive settings than burghers, and religious affiliations probably affected many depictions. By the end of the century aristocratic, or French, values were spreading among the burghers, and depictions were allowed more freedom and display.\n\nA distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting was the [[tronie]]. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. [[Jan Lievens]] and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.\n\nFamily portraits tended, as in Flanders, to be set outdoors in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively informal in dress and mood.  Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's [[schutterij]] or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter.  Rembrandt's ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (Rembrandt)|Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table.\n\n[[File:Frans Hals, De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|350px|''The [[Meagre Company]]'', an Amsterdam [[militia group portrait]] or ''schutterstuk'' by [[Frans Hals]] and [[Pieter Codde]] (1633-37)]]\n[[File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M\u00fcnster.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''[[Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M\u00fcnster]]'', 1648; 5.47 metres wide]]\n\nScientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', the most famous one being Rembrandt's ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' (1632, [[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]). Boards of trustees in their ''[[regentenstuk]]'' portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.\n\nMost [[militia group portrait]]s were commissioned in [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]], and were much more flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger.  Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition.  Rembrandt's famous ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' better known as the ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very wide format of such works.\n\nThe cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdams Historisch Museum]]; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.\n\n==Scenes of everyday life==\n[[File:Jan Steen 004b.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Jan Steen]] picture (c. 1663); while the housewife sleeps, the household play.<ref>Another version at [[Apsley House]], with a different composition, but using most of the same moralizing objects, is analysed by Franits, 206-9</ref>]]\n\n[[Genre paintings]] show scenes that prominently feature figures to whom no specific identity can be attached \u2013 they are not portraits or intended as historical figures. Together with landscape painting, the development and enormous popularity of genre painting is the most distinctive feature of Dutch painting in this period, although in this case they were also very popular in Flemish painting. Many are single figures, like the Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''; others may show large groups at some social occasion, or crowds. \n\nThere were a large number of sub-types within the genre: single figures, peasant families, tavern scenes, \"[[merry company]]\" parties, women at work about the house, scenes of village or town festivities (though these were still more common in Flemish painting), market scenes, barracks scenes, scenes with horses or farm animals, in snow, by moonlight, and many more. In fact most of these had specific terms in Dutch, but there was no overall Dutch term equivalent to \"genre painting\" \u2013 until the late 18th century the English often called them \"drolleries\".<ref>Fuchs, 42 and Slive, 123</ref>  Some artists worked mostly within one of these sub-types, especially after about 1625.<ref>Slive, 123</ref>  Over the course of the century, genre paintings tended to reduce in size.\n\nThough genre paintings provide many insights into the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted.<ref>Franits, 1, mentioning costume in works by the Utrecht Caravagggisti, and architectural settings, as especially prone to abandon accurate depiction.</ref>  Typically they show what art historians term a \"reality effect\" rather than an actual realist depiction; the degree to which this is the case varies between artists.  Many paintings which seem only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message \u2013 the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to have things both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation \u2013 the works of [[Jan Steen]], whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.<ref>Franits, 4-6 summarizes the debate, for which [[Svetlana Alpers]]' ''The Art of Describing'' (1983) is an important work (though see Slive's terse comment on p. 344). See also Franits, 20-21 on paintings being understood differently by contemporary individuals, and his p.24</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] (1625), punning visually on the [[lute]] in this brothel scene]]\n\nThe titles given later to paintings often distinguish between \"[[tavern]]s\" or \"[[inn]]s\" and \"[[brothel]]s\", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: \"Inn in front; brothel behind\" was a Dutch [[proverb]].<ref>[http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf On Diderot's Art Criticism.

The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch [[slang]] terms in the sexual area: the [[vagina]] could be represented by a [[lute]] (''luit'') or [[stocking]] (''kous''), and sex by a bird (''vogelen''), among many other options,<ref>Fuchs, pp 54, 44, 45.</ref> and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side.\n\n[[File:Peasants in an Interior (1661) Adriaen van Ostade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen van Ostade]], ''Peasants in an Interior'' (1661)]]\n\nThe same painters often painted works in a very different spirit of housewives or other women at rest in the home or at work \u2013 they massively outnumber similar treatments of men.  In fact working class men going about their jobs are notably absent from Dutch Golden Age art, with landscapes populated by travellers and idlers but rarely tillers of the soil.<ref>Slive, 191</ref>  Despite the Dutch Republic being the most important nation in international trade in Europe, and the abundance of marine paintings, scenes of dock workers and other commercial activities are very rare.<ref>Slive, 1</ref>  This group of subjects was a Dutch invention, reflecting the cultural preoccupations of the age,<ref>Explored at length by Schama in his Chapter 6. See also the analysis of [[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)]], claimed by different art historians for each tradition.</ref> and was to be adopted by artists from other countries, especially France, in the two centuries following.\n\nThe tradition developed from the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were among the first to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The [[Haarlem]] painters [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Esaias van de Velde]] were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted \"[[Merry company|merry companies]]\" of finely dressed young people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail. \n[[File:Gabri\u00ebl Metsu 006.jpg|thumb|[[Gabriel Metsu]], ''The Hunter's Gift'', c. 1660, a study in marital relations, with a visual pun.<ref>Franits, 180-182, though he strangely seems to discount the possibility that the couple are married. Married or not, the hunter clearly hopes for a return from his gift of (punning) birds, though the open shoe and gun on the floor, pointing in different directions, suggest he may be disappointed. Metsu used opposed dogs several times, and may have invented the motif, which was copied by Victorian artists. A statue of [[Cupid]] presides over the scene.</ref>]]\n\nVan de Velde was also important as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses. Hals was principally a portraitist, but also painted genre figures of a portrait size early in his career.<ref>Franits, 24-27</ref>\n\nA stay in Haarlem by the Flemish master of peasant tavern scenes [[Adriaen Brouwer]], from 1625 or 1626, gave [[Adriaen van Ostade]] his lifelong subject, though he often took a more sentimental approach. Before Brouwer, peasants had normally been depicted outdoors; he usually shows them in a plain and dim interior, though van Ostade's sometimes occupy ostentatiously decrepit farmhouses of enormous size.<ref>Franits, 34-43. Presumably these are intended to imply houses abandoned by Catholic gentry who had fled south in the Eighty Years' War. His self-portrait shows him, equally implausibly, working in just such a setting.</ref>\n\nVan Ostade was as likely to paint a single figure as a group, as were the Utrecht Caravaggisti in their genre works, and the single figure, or small groups of two or three became increasingly common, especially those including women and children. The most notable woman artist of the period, [[Judith Leyster]] (1609\u20131660), specialized in these, before her husband, [[Jan Miense Molenaer]], prevailed on her to give up painting. The [[Leiden]] school of ''[[fijnschilder]]'' (\"fine painters\") were renowned for small and highly finished paintings, many of this type. Leading artists included [[Gerard Dou]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]], and later his son [[Willem van Mieris]], [[Godfried Schalcken]], and [[Adriaen van der Werff]].\n\nThis later generation, whose work now seems over-refined compared to their predecessors, also painted portraits and histories, and were the most highly regarded and rewarded Dutch painters by the end of the period, whose works were sought after all over Europe.<ref>Fuchs, 80</ref>  Genre paintings reflected the increasing prosperity of Dutch society, and settings grew steadily more comfortable, opulent and carefully depicted as the century progressed. Artists not part of the Leiden group whose common subjects also were more intimate genre groups included [[Nicolaes Maes]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]], whose interest in light in interior scenes was shared with [[Jan Vermeer]], long a very obscure figure, but now the most highly regarded genre painter of all.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Hendrick_Avercamp_-_Winterlandschap_met_ijsvermaak.jpg|The mute [[Hendrick Avercamp]] painted almost exclusively winter scenes of crowds seen from some distance.\nFile:Pieter de Hooch - The Courtyard of a House in Delft.jpg|[[Pieter de Hooch]], ''[[Courtyard of a House in Delft]]'', 1658, a study in domestic virtue, texture and spatial complexity.

Flemish landscapes (particularly from [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]) of the 16th century first served as an example. These had been not particularly realistic, having been painted mostly in the studio, partly from imagination, and often still using the semi-aerial view from above typical of earlier [[Netherlandish]] landscape painting in the \"[[world landscape]]\" tradition of [[Joachim Patinir]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and the early [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. A more realistic Dutch landscape style developed, seen from ground level, often based on drawings made outdoors, with lower horizons which made it possible to emphasize the often impressive cloud formations that were (and are) so typical in the climate of the region, and which cast a particular light. Favourite subjects were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often with the silhouette of a city in the distance. Winter landscapes with frozen canals and creeks also abounded. The sea was a favourite topic as well since the Low Countries depended on it for trade, battled with it for new land, and battled on it with competing nations.\n\nImportant early figures in the move to realism were [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587\u20131630) and [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585\u20131634), both also mentioned above as genre painters \u2013 in Avercamp's case the same paintings deserve mention in each category. From the late 1620s the \"tonal phase\" of landscape painting started, as artists softened or blurred their outlines, and concentrated on an atmospheric effect, with great prominence given to the sky, and human figures usually either absent or small and distant. Compositions based on a diagonal across the picture space became popular, and water often featured. The leading artists were [[Jan van Goyen]] (1596\u20131656), [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] (1602\u20131670), [[Pieter de Molyn]] (1595\u20131661), and in marine painting [[Simon de Vlieger]] (1601\u20131653), with a host of minor figures \u2013 a recent study lists over 75 artists who worked in van Goyen's manner for at least a period, including Cuyp.<ref>Slive, 189 \u2013 the study is by H.-U. Beck (1991)</ref>\n\n[[File:The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede 1670 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], ''The Windmill at Wijk'' (1670)]]\n[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Rivierlandschap met ruiters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Aelbert Cuyp]], ''River landscape with Riders'' (c. 1655); Cuyp specialized in golden evening light in Dutch settings.]]\n\nFrom the 1650s the \"classical phase\" began, retaining the atmospheric quality, but with more expressive compositions and stronger contrasts of light and colour. Compositions are often anchored by a single \"heroic tree\", windmill or tower, or ship in marine works.<ref>Slive, 190 (quote), 195-202</ref>  The leading artist was [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] (1628\u20131682), who produced a great quantity and variety of work, using every typical Dutch subject except the Italianate landscape (below); instead he produced \"Nordic\" landscapes of dark and dramatic mountain pine forests with rushing torrents and waterfalls.<ref>Derived from works by [[Allart van Everdingen]] who, unlike Ruysdael, had visited Norway, in 1644. Slive, 203</ref>  \n\nHis pupil was [[Meindert Hobbema]] (1638\u20131709), best known for his atypical ''[[Avenue at Middelharnis]]'' (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were [[Aelbert Cuyp]] (1620\u20131691) and [[Philips Koninck]] (1619\u20131688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over wide flat farmlands, with a huge sky.\n\nA different type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than are found in the Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean [[staffage]] and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. [[Jan Both]] (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with [[Claude Lorrain]], was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were [[Nicolaes Berchem]] (1620\u20131683) and [[Adam Pijnacker]]. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.<ref name=\"Slive, 225\">Slive, 225</ref>\n\nA number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589\u2013c. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.<ref>Rembrandt owned seven Seghers; after a recent fire only 11 are now thought to survive \u2013 how many of Rembrandt's remain is unclear.</ref>  [[Aert van der Neer]] (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow.\n\nLandscapes with animals in the foreground were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, [[Paulus Potter]] (1625\u20131654), [[Albert Jansz. Klomp]] (1625-1688), [[Adriaen van de Velde]] (1636\u20131672) and [[Karel Dujardin]] (1626\u20131678, farm animals), with [[Philips Wouwerman]] painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow was a symbol of prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's ''The Young Bull'' is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that it appears to be a composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages.\n[[File:Assetimage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], ''[[Assendelft]] Church'', 1649, with the gravestone of [[Jan Saenredam|his father]] in the foreground.]]\n\nArchitecture also fascinated the Dutch, churches in particular. At the start of the period the main tradition was of fanciful palaces and city views of invented Northern Mannerist architecture, which Flemish painting continued to develop, and in Holland was represented by [[Dirck van Delen]]. A greater realism began to appear and the exteriors and interiors of actual buildings were reproduced, though not always faithfully. During the century understanding of the proper rendering of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] grew and were enthusiastically applied. Several artists specialized in church interiors.\n\n[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], whose father [[Jan Saenredam]] engraved sensuous nude Mannerist goddesses, painted unpeopled views of now whitewashed Gothic city churches. His emphasis on even light and geometry, with little depiction of surface textures, is brought out by comparing his works with those of [[Emanuel de Witte]], who left in the people, uneven floors, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam.  [[Gerard Houckgeest]], followed by van Witte and [[Hendrick van Vliet]], had supplemented the traditional view along a main axis of the church with diagonal views that added drama and interest.<ref>Slive, 268-273</ref>  \n\n[[Gerrit Berckheyde]] specialized in lightly populated views of main city streets, squares, and major public buildings; [[Jan van der Heyden]] preferred more intimate scenes of quieter Amsterdam streets, often with trees and canals. These were real views, but he did not hesitate to adjust them for compositional effect.<ref>Slive, 273-6</ref>\n{{-}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:View of Haarlem from the Dunes at Overeen - Date unknown.jpg|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], ''View of Haarlem''; Ruisdael is a central figure, with more varied subjects than many landscapists.\nFile:Jan Both, 1634 - 1652 - Italiaans landschap met tekenaar - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Jan Both]], c. 1650, ''Italian landscape'' of the type Both began to paint after his return from Rome.\nFile:Jan van Goyen 004b.jpg|[[Jan van Goyen]], ''Dune landscape''; an example of the \"tonal\" style\nFile:Berkheyde-Haarlem.jpg|''The Great Market in Haarlem'', 1696, by [[Gerrit Berckheyde]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Maritime painting==\n[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], typical ''View of Deventer Seen from the North-West'' (1657); an example of the \"tonal phase\".]]\n\nThe [[Dutch Republic]] relied on trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of [[marine art|maritime painting]] was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step.<ref>Slive, 213-216</ref>  Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.<ref>Franits, 1</ref>\n\nMore often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Hendrick Dubbels]] and [[Abraham Storck]].  [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] are the leading masters of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, whereas in tonal works of earlier decades the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. They left for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist.<ref>Slive, 213-224</ref>\n\n==Still lifes==\n[[File:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Claesz]], ''Vanitas'' (1630)]]\n\n[[Still lifes]] were a great opportunity to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver cutlery, intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters.\n\nSeveral types of subject were recognised: ''banketje'' were \"banquet pieces\", ''ontbijtjes'' simpler \"breakfast pieces\".<ref>MacLaren, 79</ref>  Virtually all still lifes had a moralistic message, usually concerning the brevity of life \u2013 this is known as the [[vanitas]] theme \u2013 implicit even in the absence of an obvious symbol like a skull, or less obvious one such as a half-peeled lemon (like life, sweet in appearance but bitter to taste).<ref>Slive, 279-281. Fuchs, 109</ref>  Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul. Nevertheless, the force of this message seems less powerful in the more elaborate pieces of the second half of the century.\n\n[[File:Pronkstillleven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham van Beijeren]] (c. 1660); \"ostentatious\" still life.]]\n\nInitially the objects shown were nearly always mundane. However, from the mid-century ''[[pronkstilleven]]s'' (\"ostentatious still lifes\"), which depicted expensive and exotic objects and had been developed as a subgenre in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]], became more popular.<ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100349439?rskey=FT16aA&result=0&q=pronkstilleven Pronkstilleven] in: Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms</ref> The early realist, tonal and classical phases of landscape painting had counterparts in still life painting.<ref>Fuchs, 113-6</ref>  [[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (1595\u2013c. 1680) and [[Willem Kalf]] (1619\u20131693) led the change to the ''pronkstilleven'', while [[Pieter Claesz]] (d. 1660) preferred to paint simpler \"ontbijt\" (\"breakfast pieces\"), or explicit ''vanitas'' pieces.\n\nIn all these painters, colours are often very muted, with browns dominating, especially in the middle of the century. This is less true of the works of [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] (1606\u20131684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in [[Antwerp]]. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem.\n\n[[File:Jakob Gillig - Freshwater Fish.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Gillig]], ''Freshwater Fish'' (1684)]]\nFlower paintings formed a sub-group with its own specialists, and were occasionally the speciality of the few women artists, such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gQLqRd7hJq0C&pg=PA984&dq=Houbraken+Leyster&hl=en&ei=0M61S8yHOuKJ4gbB1oWbCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Houbraken%20Leyster&f=false and only a few others, see Slive, 128, 320-321 and index, and Schama, 414. The outstanding woman artist of the age was Judith Leyster.]</ref>  The Dutch also led the world in botanical and other scientific drawings, prints and book illustrations. Despite the intense realism of individual flowers, paintings were composed from individual studies or even book illustrations, and blooms from very different seasons were routinely included in the same composition, and the same flowers reappear in different works, just as pieces of tableware do. There was also a fundamental unreality in that bouquets of flowers in vases were not in fact at all common in houses at the time \u2013 even the very rich displayed flowers one by one in  [[delftware]] [[Tulipiere|tulip-holder]]s.<ref>Fuchs, 111-112. Slive, 279-281, also covering unseasonal and recurring blooms.</ref>\n\nThe Dutch tradition was largely begun by [[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] (1573\u20131621), a Flemish-born flower painter who had settled in the north by the beginning of the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law [[Balthasar van der Ast]] (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a dark background, became more popular, exemplified by the works of [[Willem van Aelst]] (1627\u20131683). Painters from [[Leiden]], The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre.\n\nDead game, and birds painted live but studied from the dead, were another subgenre, as were dead fish, a staple of the Dutch diet \u2013 [[Abraham van Beijeren]] did many of these.<ref>Slive, 287-291</ref>  The Dutch were less given to the Flemish style of combining large still life elements with other types of painting \u2013 they would have been considered prideful in portraits \u2013 and the Flemish habit of specialist painters collaborating on the different elements in the same work. But this sometimes did happen \u2013 Philips Wouwerman was occasionally used to add men and horses to turn a landscape into a hunting or skirmish scene, Berchem or Adriaen van de Velde to add people or farm animals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Willem van Aelst - Bloementuil.jpg|[[Willem van Aelst]], ''Still life with a watch'' (c. 1665), with typical dark background.\nFile:Heda, Willem Claeszoon - Breakfast Table with Blackberry Pie - WGA.jpg|[[Willem Claeszoon Heda]], ''Breakfast Table with Blackberry Pie'' (1631); Heda was famous for his depiction of reflective surfaces.\nFile:Jan Davidszoon de Heem, Still-life with Books and Skull (Vanitas).JPG|[[Jan Davidszoon de Heem]], ''[[Vanitas]]'' (1629)\nFile:Jan Weenix 003.jpg|[[Jan Weenix]], ''Still Life with a Dead Peacock'' (1692), set in the gardens of a large country house.\n</gallery>\n\n==Foreign lands==\n[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazili\u00eb Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|[[Frans Post]], scene in [[Dutch Brazil]]; painted in 1662, some years after the colony was lost.]]\nFor Dutch artists, Karel van Mander's ''Schilderboeck'' was meant not only as a list of biographies, but also a source of advice for young artists. It quickly became a classic standard work for generations of young Dutch and Flemish artists in the 17th century. The book advised artists to travel and see the sights of Florence and Rome, and after 1604 many did so.  However, it is noticeable that the most important Dutch artists in all fields, figures such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, did not make the voyage.<ref name=\"Fuchs, 43\"/>\n\nMany Dutch (and Flemish) painters worked abroad or exported their work; [[printmaking]] was also an important export market, by which Rembrandt became known across Europe. The [[Dutch Gift]] to [[Charles II of England]] was a diplomatic gift which included four contemporary Dutch paintings. English painting was heavily reliant on Dutch painters, with Sir [[Peter Lely]] followed by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], developing the English portrait style established by the Flemish [[Anthony van Dyck]] before the [[English Civil War]]. The marine painters van der Velde, [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]], were among several artists who left Holland at the French invasion of 1672, which brought a collapse in the art market. They also moved to London, and the beginnings of English landscape painting were established by several less distinguished Dutch painters, such as [[Hendrick Danckerts]].\n\nThe [[Bamboccianti]] were a colony of Dutch artists who introduced the genre scene to Italy.  [[Jan Weenix]] and [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] specialized in game and birds, dead or alive, and were in demand for country house and shooting-lodge [[overdoor]]s across Northern Europe.  \n\nAlthough the Dutch control of the northeast sugar-producing region of [[Dutch Brazil]] turned out to be brief (1630-54), Governor [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen]] invited Dutch artists to paint scenes which are valuable in showing the seventeenth-century landscape and peoples of the region.<ref>R\u00fcdger Joppien. \"The Dutch Vision of Brazil: Johan Maurits and His Artists,\" in ''Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, 1604-1679: A Humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil'', ed.

Already by the end of the period artists were complaining that buyers were more interested in dead than living artists.\n\nIf only because of the enormous quantities produced, Dutch Golden Age painting has always formed a significant part of collections of [[Old Master]] paintings, itself a term invented in the 18th century to describe Dutch Golden Age artists. Taking only Wouwerman paintings in old royal collections, there are more than 60 in [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden]] and over 50 in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].<ref>Slive, 212</ref>  But the reputation of the period has shown many changes and shifts of emphasis. One nearly constant factor has been admiration for [[Rembrandt]], especially since the Romantic period. Other artists have shown drastic shifts in critical fortune and market price; at the end of the period some of the active Leiden [[fijnschilders]] had enormous reputations, but since the mid-19th century realist works in various genres have been far more appreciated.<ref>See Reitlinger, 11-15, 23-4, and ''passim'', and listings for individual artists</ref>\n\nVermeer was rescued from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, by which time several of his works had been re-attributed to others. However the fact that so many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates that the quality of individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown.<ref>See Reitlinger, 483-4, and ''passim''</ref>  Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of [[Adriaen Coorte]] in the 1950s,<ref>Slive, 319</ref> and the landscapists [[Jacobus Mancaden]] and [[Frans Post]] earlier in the century.<ref>Slive, 191-2</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard ter Borch (II) 019.jpg|thumb|[[Gerard ter Borch]], ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', or ''Brothel Scene'' (c. 1654; Amsterdam version).]]\n\nGenre paintings were long popular, but little-regarded. In 1780 [[Horace Walpole]] disapproved that they \"invite laughter to divert itself with the nastiest indelicacy of boors\".<ref>\"Advertisement\" or Preface to Vol. 4 of the 2nd edition of ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', based on [[George Vertue]]'s notebooks, page ix, 1782, J. Dodwell, London, [https://archive.org/details/anecdotespainti05vertgoog Internet Archive]</ref>  Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], the English leader of 18th-century [[academic art]], made several revealing comments on Dutch art. He was impressed by the quality of Vermeer's ''Milkmaid'' (illustrated at the start of this article), and the liveliness of Hals' portraits, regretting he lacked the \"patience\" to finish them properly, and lamented that Steen had not been born in Italy and formed by the [[High Renaissance]], so that his talent could have been put to better use.<ref>Slive, 144 (Vermeer), 41-2 (Hals), 173 (Steen)</ref>  By Reynold's time the moralist aspect of genre painting was no longer understood, even in the Netherlands; the famous example is the so-called ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', as it was then known, by [[Gerard ter Borch]]. This was praised by [[Goethe]] and others for the delicacy of its depiction of a father reprimanding his daughter. In fact to most (but not all) modern scholars it is a proposition scene in a brothel \u2013 there are two versions (Berlin & Amsterdam) and it is unclear whether a \"tell-tale coin\" in the man's hand has been removed or overpainted in either.<ref>Slive, 158-160 (coin quote), and Fuchs, 147-8, who uses the title ''Brothel Scene''. Franits, 146-7, citing Alison Kettering, says there is \"deliberate vagueness\" as to the subject, and still uses the title ''Paternal Admonition''.</ref>\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, the down to earth realism of Dutch painting was a \"[[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] taste\" in England, and in France associated with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and aspirations for political reform.<ref>Reitlinger, I, 11-15. Quote p.13</ref>  In the 19th century, with a near-universal respect for realism, and the final decline of the hierarchy of genres, contemporary painters began to borrow from genre painters both their realism and their use of objects for narrative purposes, and paint similar subjects themselves, with all the genres the Dutch had pioneered appearing on far larger canvases (still lifes excepted).\n\nIn landscape painting, the Italianate artists were the most influential and highly regarded in the 18th century, but [[John Constable]] was among those Romantics who denounced them for artificiality, preferring the tonal and classical artists.<ref name=\"Slive, 225\"/>  In fact both groups remained influential and popular in the 19th century.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Art of the Low Countries]]\n* [[Delft School (painting)]]\n* [[Dutch School (painting)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==References==\n{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}\nFor more details and many more painters see [[Dutch Golden Age, List Of People#Painting|Dutch Golden Age, List Of People \u2013 Painters]] and [[List of Dutch painters]].

The northern [[Terminology of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself.  The painting of religious subjects declined sharply, but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up.\n\nAlthough Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general European period of [[Baroque painting]], and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including [[Flemish Baroque painting|that of neighbouring Flanders]]. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed [[realism (arts)|realism]] inherited from [[Early Netherlandish painting]].\n[[File:Frans Hals 008.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Hals]]' [[tronie]], with the later title ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]''. 1628\u201330.

But, for example, [[still-life]] is also a genre in painting.</ref> with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then until the [[Rampjaar|French invasion of 1672]] is the core of Golden Age painting.  Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and often a particular sub-type within these categories.  Many of these types of subject were new in Western painting, and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development.\n\n==Types of painting==\n[[File:Paulus Potter - Young Bull.JPG|thumb|[[Paulus Potter]], ''[[The Bull (painting)|The Bull]]'' (1647); 3.4 metres wide. An unusually monumental animal painting that challenges the [[hierarchy of genres]].]]\n\nA distinctive feature of the period, compared to earlier European painting, was the limited number of religious paintings. Dutch [[Calvinism]] forbade religious paintings in churches, and though biblical subjects were acceptable in private homes, relatively few were produced. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and [[still life]]s of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists.\n\nThe widely held theory of the \"[[hierarchy of genres]]\" in painting, whereby some types were regarded as more prestigious than others, led many painters to want to produce history painting. However this was the hardest to sell, as even Rembrandt found. Many were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. In descending order of status, the categories in the hierarchy were:\n*[[history painting]], including [[Allegory|allegories]] and popular religious subjects.\n*[[Portrait painting]], including the ''[[tronie]]''\n*[[Genre works|genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life\n*[[landscape art|landscape]], including seascapes, battlescenes, cityscapes, and ruins (landscapists were the \"common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art\" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].<ref>Fuchs, 104</ref>) \n*[[still life]]\n\nThe Dutch concentrated heavily on the \"lower\" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy.<ref>Franits, 2-3</ref> Most paintings were relatively small \u2013 the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating, fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface, many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from [[printmaking]]. In turn, the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century \u2013 poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. \n\nThere was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in [[tomb monument]]s and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. Painted [[delftware]] tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the [[auricular style]], led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking.\n\n==The art world==\n[[File:Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirck Hals]], genre scene of ''Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior''. Note the paintings on the wall of what appears to be a tavern; also [[commons:File:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Tailor's Workshop.jpg|here]].]]\n\nForeigners remarked on the enormous quantities of art produced and the large fairs where many paintings were sold \u2013 it has been roughly estimated that over 1.3 million Dutch pictures were painted in the 20 years after 1640 alone.<ref>Lloyd, 15, citing [[Jonathan Israel]].

Such is the generall Notion, enclination and delight that these Countrie Native have to Painting\" reported an English traveller in 1640.<ref>Fuchs, 43; Franits, 2 calls this \"oft-quoted\" remark \"undoubtedly exaggerated\".</ref>  There were for virtually the first time many professional art dealers, several also significant artists, like [[Vermeer]] and his father, [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Willem Kalf]]. Rembrandt's dealer [[Hendrick van Uylenburgh]] and his son [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh|Gerrit]] were among the most important.  Landscapes were the easiest uncommissioned works to sell, and their painters were the \"common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art\" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].<ref>Fuchs, 104</ref>\n\n[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|The Haarlem Painter's Guild]]'' in 1675, by  [[Jan de Bray]], whose self-portrait is the second from the left]]\n\nThe technical quality of Dutch artists was generally high, still mostly following the old medieval system of training by apprenticeship with a master.  Typically workshops were smaller than in Flanders or Italy, with only one or two apprentices at a time, the number often being restricted by guild regulations.  The turmoil of the early years of the Republic, with displaced artists from the South moving north and the loss of traditional markets in the court and church, led to a resurgence of artists guilds, often still called the [[Guild of Saint Luke]].  In many cases these involved the artists extricating themselves from medieval groupings where they shared a guild with several other trades, such as housepainting.  Several new guilds were established in the period: [[Amsterdam]] in 1579, [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|Haarlem]] in 1590, and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] between 1609 and 1611.<ref>Prak (2008), 151-153, or Prak (2003), 241</ref> The [[Leiden]] authorities distrusted guilds and did not allow one until 1648.<ref>Prak (2008), 153</ref>\n\nLater in the century it began to become clear to all involved that the old idea of a guild controlling both training and sales no longer worked well, and gradually the guilds were replaced with [[academies]], often only concerned with the training of artists.  [[The Hague]], with the court, was an early example, where artists split into two groups in 1656 with the founding of the [[Confrerie Pictura]].  With the obvious exception of portraits, many more Dutch paintings were done \"speculatively\" without a specific commission than was then the case in other countries \u2013 one of many ways in which the Dutch art market showed the future.<ref name=\"Fuchs, 43\">Fuchs, 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Gelder Selbstbildnis m h\u00e4sslicher Frau@St\u00e4del Museum Frankfurt20170818.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aert de Gelder]], ''Self-portrait as [[Zeuxis]]'' (1685)]]\n\nThere were many dynasties of artists, and many married the daughters of their masters or other artists. Many artists came from well-off families, who paid fees for their apprenticeships, and they often married into property. Rembrandt and Jan Steen were both enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]] for a while. Several cities had distinct styles and specialities by subject, but Amsterdam was the largest artistic centre, because of its great wealth.<ref>Franits' book is largely organized by city and by period; Slive by subject categories</ref>  Cities such as [[Haarlem]] and [[Utrecht]] were more important in the first half of the century, with [[Leiden]] and other cities emerging after 1648, and above all Amsterdam, which increasingly drew to it artists from the rest of the Netherlands, as well as [[Flanders]] and Germany.<ref>Franits throughout, summarized on p. 260</ref>\n\nDutch artists were strikingly less concerned about artistic theory than those of many nations, and less given to discussing their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy.<ref>Fuchs, 76</ref>  As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art was a source of national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are [[Karel van Mander]] (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and [[Arnold Houbraken]] (''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' \u2013 \"The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters\", 1718\u201321). Both followed, and indeed exceeded, [[Vasari]] in including a great number of short lives of artists \u2013 over 500 in Houbraken's case \u2013 and both are considered generally accurate on factual matters.\n\nThe German artist [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (1606\u20131688) had worked for periods in Holland, and his ''Deutsche Akademie'' in the same format covers many Dutch artists he knew. Houbraken's master, and Rembrandt's pupil, was [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]] (1627\u20131678), whose ''Zichtbare wereld'' and ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' (1678) contain more critical than biographical information, and are among the most important treatises on painting of the period. Like other Dutch works on the theory of art, they expound many commonplaces of Renaissance theory and do not entirely reflect contemporary Dutch art, still often concentrating on history painting.<ref>See Slive, 296-7 and elsewhere</ref>\n\n==History painting==\n[[File:Danae by Van Loo.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Loo]], ''[[Dana\u00eb]]'' (compare [[Dana\u00eb (Rembrandt painting)|Rembrandt's treatment]])]]\n\nThis category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past, but also paintings that showed biblical, mythological, literary and [[allegory|allegorical]] scenes. Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category, and were treated in a realist fashion, as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine, townscape or landscape subjects.<ref>Fuchs, 107</ref>  Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries, as there was no local market for church art, and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill. More than that, the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of [[Mannerist]] allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the [[Dutch Revolt]], which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric.<ref>Fuchs, 62, R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', \"Prologue\" pp.&nbsp;27\u201343, 1945, Faber, London</ref>  History painting was now a \"minority art\", although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjects<ref>Fuchs, 62-3</ref>\n\nMore than in other types of painting, Dutch history painters continued to be influenced by Italian painting. Prints and copies of Italian masterpieces circulated and suggested certain compositional schemes. The growing Dutch skill in the depiction of light was brought to bear on styles derived from Italy, notably that of [[Caravaggio]]. Some Dutch painters also travelled to Italy, though this was less common than with their Flemish contemporaries, as can be seen from the membership of the [[Bentvueghels]] club in Rome.<ref name=\"Fuchs, 43\"/>\n\n[[File:Dirk van Baburen - Kroning met de doornenkroon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Utrecht Caravaggism]]: [[Dirck van Baburen]], ''Christ crowned with thorns'', 1623, for a convent in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], not a market available in most of Holland.]]\n\nIn the early part of the century many [[Northern Mannerist]] artists with styles formed in the previous century continued to work, until the 1630s in the cases of [[Abraham Bloemaert]] and [[Joachim Wtewael]].<ref>Slive, 13-14</ref>  Many history paintings were small in scale, with the German painter (based in Rome) [[Adam Elsheimer]] as much an influence as Caravaggio (both died in 1610) on Dutch painters like [[Pieter Lastman]], Rembrandt's master, and Jan and [[Jacob Pynas]]. Compared to Baroque history painting from other countries, they shared the Dutch emphasis on realism, and narrative directness, and are sometimes known as the \"Pre-Rembrandtists\", as Rembrandt's early paintings were in this style.<ref>Fuchs, 62-69</ref>\n\n[[Utrecht Caravaggism]] describes a group of artists who produced both history painting and generally large genre scenes in an Italian-influenced style, often making heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. Utrecht, before the revolt the most important city in the new Dutch territory, was an unusual Dutch city, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-century, even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.<ref>Franits, 65. Catholic 17th-century Dutch artists included Abraham Bloemaert and Gerard van Honthorst from Utrecht, and Jan Steen, [[Paulus Bor]], [[Jacob van Velsen]], plus Vermeer who probably converted at his marriage.[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/catholic_church.html]  [[Jacob Jordaens]] was among Flemish Protestant artists.</ref>  The leading artists were [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerard van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], and the school was active about 1630, although van Honthorst continued until the 1650s as a successful court painter to the English, Dutch and Danish courts in a more classical style.<ref>Slive, 22-4</ref>\n\nRembrandt began as a history painter before finding financial success as a portraitist, and he never relinquished his ambitions in this area. A great number of his [[etching]]s are of narrative religious scenes, and the story of his last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.<ref>Fuchs, 69-77</ref>  Several artists, many his pupils, attempted with some success to continue his very personal style; [[Govaert Flinck]] was the most successful.  [[Gerard de Lairesse]] (1640\u20131711) was another of these, before falling under heavy influence from French classicism, and becoming its leading Dutch proponent as both artist and theoretician.<ref>Fuchs, 77-78</ref>\n\nNudity was effectively the preserve of the history painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did. For all their uninhibited suggestiveness, genre painters rarely revealed more than a generous cleavage or stretch of thigh, usually when painting prostitutes or \"Italian\" peasants.\n\n==Portraits==\n[[File:Portrait sophia trip wife of balthasar coymans.jpg|thumb|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''Sophia Trip'' (1645), a member of one of the wealthiest families in Holland.<ref>[http://www.beernink.com/articles/triptree.htm?timeline=off Trip family tree]. Her grandparents' various portraits by Rembrandt are famous.</ref>]]\n\nPortrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century, as there was a large mercantile class who were far more ready to commission portraits than their equivalents in other countries; a summary of various estimates of total production arrives at between 750,000 and 1,100,000 portraits.<ref>Ekkart, 17 n.1 (on p. 228).</ref>  Rembrandt enjoyed his greatest period of financial success as a young Amsterdam portraitist, but like other artists, grew rather bored with painting commissioned portraits of burghers: \"artists travel along this road without delight\", according to van Mander.<ref>Shawe-Taylor, 22-23, 32-33 on portraits, quotation from 33</ref>\n\nWhile Dutch portrait painting avoids the swagger and excessive rhetoric of the aristocratic Baroque portraiture current in the rest of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting ''en masse'', as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.\n\n[[File:Willem Heythuijsen by Frans Hals 1634.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frans Hals]], ''Willem Heythuijsen'' (1634), {{convert|47|x|37|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\n[[File:Van den Kerckhoven door Jan Mijtens.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johannes Mytens|Jan Mijtens]], family portrait, 1652, with the boys in \"picturesque\" dress.]]\n\nThe other great portraitist of the period is [[Frans Hals]], whose famously lively brushwork and ability to show sitters looking relaxed and cheerful adds excitement to even the most unpromising subjects. The extremely \"nonchalant pose\" of his portrait of Willem Heythuijsen is exceptional: \"no other portrait from this period is so informal\".<ref>Ekkart, 118</ref>  The sitter was a wealthy textile merchant who had already commissioned Hals' only individual life-sized full-length portrait ten years before. In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes.<ref>Ekkart, 130 and 114.</ref> [[Jan de Bray]] encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family. [[Thomas de Keyser]], [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], [[Ferdinand Bol]] and others, including many mentioned below as history or genre painters, did their best to enliven more conventional works. Portraiture, less affected by fashion than other types of painting, remained the safe fallback for Dutch artists.\n\nFrom what little we know of the studio procedures of artists, it seems that, as elsewhere in Europe, the face was probably drawn and perhaps painted at an initial sitting or two. The typical number of further sittings is unclear - between zero (for a Rembrandt full-length) and 50 appear documented. The clothes were left at the studio and might well be painted by assistants, or a brought-in specialist master, although, or because, they were regarded as a very important part of the painting.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 68-69</ref>  Married and never-married women can be distinguished by their dress, highlighting how few single women were painted, except in family groups.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 66-68</ref>  As elsewhere, the accuracy of the clothes shown is variable - striped and patterned clothes were worn, but artists rarely show them, understandably avoiding the extra work.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 73</ref> Lace and [[ruff]] collars were unavoidable, and presented a formidable challenge to painters intent on realism. Rembrandt evolved a more effective way of painting patterned lace, laying in broad white stokes, and then painting lightly in black to show the pattern. Another way of doing this was to paint in white over a black layer, and scratch off the white with the end of the brush to show the pattern.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 69-71</ref>\n\nAt the end of the century there was a fashion for showing sitters in a semi-fancy dress, begun in England by van Dyck in the 1630s, known as \"picturesque\" or \"Roman\" dress.<ref>Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 72-73</ref>  Aristocratic, and militia, sitters allowed themselves more freedom in bright dress and expansive settings than burghers, and religious affiliations probably affected many depictions. By the end of the century aristocratic, or French, values were spreading among the burghers, and depictions were allowed more freedom and display.\n\nA distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting was the [[tronie]]. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. [[Jan Lievens]] and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.\n\nFamily portraits tended, as in Flanders, to be set outdoors in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively informal in dress and mood.  Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's [[schutterij]] or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter.  Rembrandt's ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (Rembrandt)|Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table.\n\n[[File:Frans Hals, De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|350px|''The [[Meagre Company]]'', an Amsterdam [[militia group portrait]] or ''schutterstuk'' by [[Frans Hals]] and [[Pieter Codde]] (1633-37)]]\n[[File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M\u00fcnster.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''[[Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M\u00fcnster]]'', 1648; 5.47 metres wide]]\n\nScientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', the most famous one being Rembrandt's ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' (1632, [[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]). Boards of trustees in their ''[[regentenstuk]]'' portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.\n\nMost [[militia group portrait]]s were commissioned in [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]], and were much more flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger.  Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition.  Rembrandt's famous ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' better known as the ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very wide format of such works.\n\nThe cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdams Historisch Museum]]; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.\n\n==Scenes of everyday life==\n[[File:Jan Steen 004b.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Jan Steen]] picture (c. 1663); while the housewife sleeps, the household play.<ref>Another version at [[Apsley House]], with a different composition, but using most of the same moralizing objects, is analysed by Franits, 206-9</ref>]]\n\n[[Genre paintings]] show scenes that prominently feature figures to whom no specific identity can be attached \u2013 they are not portraits or intended as historical figures. Together with landscape painting, the development and enormous popularity of genre painting is the most distinctive feature of Dutch painting in this period, although in this case they were also very popular in Flemish painting. Many are single figures, like the Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''; others may show large groups at some social occasion, or crowds. \n\nThere were a large number of sub-types within the genre: single figures, peasant families, tavern scenes, \"[[merry company]]\" parties, women at work about the house, scenes of village or town festivities (though these were still more common in Flemish painting), market scenes, barracks scenes, scenes with horses or farm animals, in snow, by moonlight, and many more. In fact most of these had specific terms in Dutch, but there was no overall Dutch term equivalent to \"genre painting\" \u2013 until the late 18th century the English often called them \"drolleries\".<ref>Fuchs, 42 and Slive, 123</ref>  Some artists worked mostly within one of these sub-types, especially after about 1625.<ref>Slive, 123</ref>  Over the course of the century, genre paintings tended to reduce in size.\n\nThough genre paintings provide many insights into the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted.<ref>Franits, 1, mentioning costume in works by the Utrecht Caravagggisti, and architectural settings, as especially prone to abandon accurate depiction.</ref>  Typically they show what art historians term a \"reality effect\" rather than an actual realist depiction; the degree to which this is the case varies between artists.  Many paintings which seem only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message \u2013 the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to have things both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation \u2013 the works of [[Jan Steen]], whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.<ref>Franits, 4-6 summarizes the debate, for which [[Svetlana Alpers]]' ''The Art of Describing'' (1983) is an important work (though see Slive's terse comment on p. 344). See also Franits, 20-21 on paintings being understood differently by contemporary individuals, and his p.24</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] (1625), punning visually on the [[lute]] in this brothel scene]]\n\nThe titles given later to paintings often distinguish between \"[[tavern]]s\" or \"[[inn]]s\" and \"[[brothel]]s\", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: \"Inn in front; brothel behind\" was a Dutch [[proverb]].<ref>[http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf On Diderot's Art Criticism.

The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch [[slang]] terms in the sexual area: the [[vagina]] could be represented by a [[lute]] (''luit'') or [[stocking]] (''kous''), and sex by a bird (''vogelen''), among many other options,<ref>Fuchs, pp 54, 44, 45.</ref> and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side.\n\n[[File:Peasants in an Interior (1661) Adriaen van Ostade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen van Ostade]], ''Peasants in an Interior'' (1661)]]\n\nThe same painters often painted works in a very different spirit of housewives or other women at rest in the home or at work \u2013 they massively outnumber similar treatments of men.  In fact working class men going about their jobs are notably absent from Dutch Golden Age art, with landscapes populated by travellers and idlers but rarely tillers of the soil.<ref>Slive, 191</ref>  Despite the Dutch Republic being the most important nation in international trade in Europe, and the abundance of marine paintings, scenes of dock workers and other commercial activities are very rare.<ref>Slive, 1</ref>  This group of subjects was a Dutch invention, reflecting the cultural preoccupations of the age,<ref>Explored at length by Schama in his Chapter 6. See also the analysis of [[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)]], claimed by different art historians for each tradition.</ref> and was to be adopted by artists from other countries, especially France, in the two centuries following.\n\nThe tradition developed from the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were among the first to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The [[Haarlem]] painters [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Esaias van de Velde]] were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted \"[[Merry company|merry companies]]\" of finely dressed young people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail. \n[[File:Gabri\u00ebl Metsu 006.jpg|thumb|[[Gabriel Metsu]], ''The Hunter's Gift'', c. 1660, a study in marital relations, with a visual pun.<ref>Franits, 180-182, though he strangely seems to discount the possibility that the couple are married. Married or not, the hunter clearly hopes for a return from his gift of (punning) birds, though the open shoe and gun on the floor, pointing in different directions, suggest he may be disappointed. Metsu used opposed dogs several times, and may have invented the motif, which was copied by Victorian artists. A statue of [[Cupid]] presides over the scene.</ref>]]\n\nVan de Velde was also important as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses. Hals was principally a portraitist, but also painted genre figures of a portrait size early in his career.<ref>Franits, 24-27</ref>\n\nA stay in Haarlem by the Flemish master of peasant tavern scenes [[Adriaen Brouwer]], from 1625 or 1626, gave [[Adriaen van Ostade]] his lifelong subject, though he often took a more sentimental approach. Before Brouwer, peasants had normally been depicted outdoors; he usually shows them in a plain and dim interior, though van Ostade's sometimes occupy ostentatiously decrepit farmhouses of enormous size.<ref>Franits, 34-43. Presumably these are intended to imply houses abandoned by Catholic gentry who had fled south in the Eighty Years' War. His self-portrait shows him, equally implausibly, working in just such a setting.</ref>\n\nVan Ostade was as likely to paint a single figure as a group, as were the Utrecht Caravaggisti in their genre works, and the single figure, or small groups of two or three became increasingly common, especially those including women and children. The most notable woman artist of the period, [[Judith Leyster]] (1609\u20131660), specialized in these, before her husband, [[Jan Miense Molenaer]], prevailed on her to give up painting. The [[Leiden]] school of ''[[fijnschilder]]'' (\"fine painters\") were renowned for small and highly finished paintings, many of this type. Leading artists included [[Gerard Dou]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]], and later his son [[Willem van Mieris]], [[Godfried Schalcken]], and [[Adriaen van der Werff]].\n\nThis later generation, whose work now seems over-refined compared to their predecessors, also painted portraits and histories, and were the most highly regarded and rewarded Dutch painters by the end of the period, whose works were sought after all over Europe.<ref>Fuchs, 80</ref>  Genre paintings reflected the increasing prosperity of Dutch society, and settings grew steadily more comfortable, opulent and carefully depicted as the century progressed. Artists not part of the Leiden group whose common subjects also were more intimate genre groups included [[Nicolaes Maes]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]], whose interest in light in interior scenes was shared with [[Jan Vermeer]], long a very obscure figure, but now the most highly regarded genre painter of all.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Hendrick_Avercamp_-_Winterlandschap_met_ijsvermaak.jpg|The mute [[Hendrick Avercamp]] painted almost exclusively winter scenes of crowds seen from some distance.\nFile:Pieter de Hooch - The Courtyard of a House in Delft.jpg|[[Pieter de Hooch]], ''[[Courtyard of a House in Delft]]'', 1658, a study in domestic virtue, texture and spatial complexity.

Flemish landscapes (particularly from [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]) of the 16th century first served as an example. These had been not particularly realistic, having been painted mostly in the studio, partly from imagination, and often still using the semi-aerial view from above typical of earlier [[Netherlandish]] landscape painting in the \"[[world landscape]]\" tradition of [[Joachim Patinir]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and the early [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. A more realistic Dutch landscape style developed, seen from ground level, often based on drawings made outdoors, with lower horizons which made it possible to emphasize the often impressive cloud formations that were (and are) so typical in the climate of the region, and which cast a particular light. Favourite subjects were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often with the silhouette of a city in the distance. Winter landscapes with frozen canals and creeks also abounded. The sea was a favourite topic as well since the Low Countries depended on it for trade, battled with it for new land, and battled on it with competing nations.\n\nImportant early figures in the move to realism were [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587\u20131630) and [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585\u20131634), both also mentioned above as genre painters \u2013 in Avercamp's case the same paintings deserve mention in each category. From the late 1620s the \"tonal phase\" of landscape painting started, as artists softened or blurred their outlines, and concentrated on an atmospheric effect, with great prominence given to the sky, and human figures usually either absent or small and distant. Compositions based on a diagonal across the picture space became popular, and water often featured. The leading artists were [[Jan van Goyen]] (1596\u20131656), [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] (1602\u20131670), [[Pieter de Molyn]] (1595\u20131661), and in marine painting [[Simon de Vlieger]] (1601\u20131653), with a host of minor figures \u2013 a recent study lists over 75 artists who worked in van Goyen's manner for at least a period, including Cuyp.<ref>Slive, 189 \u2013 the study is by H.-U. Beck (1991)</ref>\n\n[[File:The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede 1670 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], ''The Windmill at Wijk'' (1670)]]\n[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Rivierlandschap met ruiters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Aelbert Cuyp]], ''River landscape with Riders'' (c. 1655); Cuyp specialized in golden evening light in Dutch settings.]]\n\nFrom the 1650s the \"classical phase\" began, retaining the atmospheric quality, but with more expressive compositions and stronger contrasts of light and colour. Compositions are often anchored by a single \"heroic tree\", windmill or tower, or ship in marine works.<ref>Slive, 190 (quote), 195-202</ref>  The leading artist was [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] (1628\u20131682), who produced a great quantity and variety of work, using every typical Dutch subject except the Italianate landscape (below); instead he produced \"Nordic\" landscapes of dark and dramatic mountain pine forests with rushing torrents and waterfalls.<ref>Derived from works by [[Allart van Everdingen]] who, unlike Ruysdael, had visited Norway, in 1644. Slive, 203</ref>  \n\nHis pupil was [[Meindert Hobbema]] (1638\u20131709), best known for his atypical ''[[Avenue at Middelharnis]]'' (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were [[Aelbert Cuyp]] (1620\u20131691) and [[Philips Koninck]] (1619\u20131688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over wide flat farmlands, with a huge sky.\n\nA different type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than are found in the Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean [[staffage]] and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. [[Jan Both]] (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with [[Claude Lorrain]], was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were [[Nicolaes Berchem]] (1620\u20131683) and [[Adam Pijnacker]]. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.<ref name=\"Slive, 225\">Slive, 225</ref>\n\nA number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589\u2013c. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.<ref>Rembrandt owned seven Seghers; after a recent fire only 11 are now thought to survive \u2013 how many of Rembrandt's remain is unclear.</ref>  [[Aert van der Neer]] (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow.\n\nLandscapes with animals in the foreground were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, [[Paulus Potter]] (1625\u20131654), [[Albert Jansz. Klomp]] (1625-1688), [[Adriaen van de Velde]] (1636\u20131672) and [[Karel Dujardin]] (1626\u20131678, farm animals), with [[Philips Wouwerman]] painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow was a symbol of prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's ''The Young Bull'' is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that it appears to be a composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages.\n[[File:Assetimage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], ''[[Assendelft]] Church'', 1649, with the gravestone of [[Jan Saenredam|his father]] in the foreground.]]\n\nArchitecture also fascinated the Dutch, churches in particular. At the start of the period the main tradition was of fanciful palaces and city views of invented Northern Mannerist architecture, which Flemish painting continued to develop, and in Holland was represented by [[Dirck van Delen]]. A greater realism began to appear and the exteriors and interiors of actual buildings were reproduced, though not always faithfully. During the century understanding of the proper rendering of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] grew and were enthusiastically applied. Several artists specialized in church interiors.\n\n[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], whose father [[Jan Saenredam]] engraved sensuous nude Mannerist goddesses, painted unpeopled views of now whitewashed Gothic city churches. His emphasis on even light and geometry, with little depiction of surface textures, is brought out by comparing his works with those of [[Emanuel de Witte]], who left in the people, uneven floors, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam.  [[Gerard Houckgeest]], followed by van Witte and [[Hendrick van Vliet]], had supplemented the traditional view along a main axis of the church with diagonal views that added drama and interest.<ref>Slive, 268-273</ref>  \n\n[[Gerrit Berckheyde]] specialized in lightly populated views of main city streets, squares, and major public buildings; [[Jan van der Heyden]] preferred more intimate scenes of quieter Amsterdam streets, often with trees and canals. These were real views, but he did not hesitate to adjust them for compositional effect.<ref>Slive, 273-6</ref>\n{{-}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:View of Haarlem from the Dunes at Overeen - Date unknown.jpg|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], ''View of Haarlem''; Ruisdael is a central figure, with more varied subjects than many landscapists.\nFile:Jan Both, 1634 - 1652 - Italiaans landschap met tekenaar - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Jan Both]], c. 1650, ''Italian landscape'' of the type Both began to paint after his return from Rome.\nFile:Jan van Goyen 004b.jpg|[[Jan van Goyen]], ''Dune landscape''; an example of the \"tonal\" style\nFile:Berkheyde-Haarlem.jpg|''The Great Market in Haarlem'', 1696, by [[Gerrit Berckheyde]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Maritime painting==\n[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|thumb|[[Salomon van Ruisdael]], typical ''View of Deventer Seen from the North-West'' (1657); an example of the \"tonal phase\".]]\n\nThe [[Dutch Republic]] relied on trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of [[marine art|maritime painting]] was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step.<ref>Slive, 213-216</ref>  Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.<ref>Franits, 1</ref>\n\nMore often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Hendrick Dubbels]] and [[Abraham Storck]].  [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] are the leading masters of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, whereas in tonal works of earlier decades the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. They left for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist.<ref>Slive, 213-224</ref>\n\n==Still lifes==\n[[File:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Claesz]], ''Vanitas'' (1630)]]\n\n[[Still lifes]] were a great opportunity to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver cutlery, intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters.\n\nSeveral types of subject were recognised: ''banketje'' were \"banquet pieces\", ''ontbijtjes'' simpler \"breakfast pieces\".<ref>MacLaren, 79</ref>  Virtually all still lifes had a moralistic message, usually concerning the brevity of life \u2013 this is known as the [[vanitas]] theme \u2013 implicit even in the absence of an obvious symbol like a skull, or less obvious one such as a half-peeled lemon (like life, sweet in appearance but bitter to taste).<ref>Slive, 279-281. Fuchs, 109</ref>  Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul. Nevertheless, the force of this message seems less powerful in the more elaborate pieces of the second half of the century.\n\n[[File:Pronkstillleven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham van Beijeren]] (c. 1660); \"ostentatious\" still life.]]\n\nInitially the objects shown were nearly always mundane. However, from the mid-century ''[[pronkstilleven]]s'' (\"ostentatious still lifes\"), which depicted expensive and exotic objects and had been developed as a subgenre in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]], became more popular.<ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100349439?rskey=FT16aA&result=0&q=pronkstilleven Pronkstilleven] in: Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms</ref> The early realist, tonal and classical phases of landscape painting had counterparts in still life painting.<ref>Fuchs, 113-6</ref>  [[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (1595\u2013c. 1680) and [[Willem Kalf]] (1619\u20131693) led the change to the ''pronkstilleven'', while [[Pieter Claesz]] (d. 1660) preferred to paint simpler \"ontbijt\" (\"breakfast pieces\"), or explicit ''vanitas'' pieces.\n\nIn all these painters, colours are often very muted, with browns dominating, especially in the middle of the century. This is less true of the works of [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] (1606\u20131684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in [[Antwerp]]. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem.\n\n[[File:Jakob Gillig - Freshwater Fish.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Gillig]], ''Freshwater Fish'' (1684)]]\nFlower paintings formed a sub-group with its own specialists, and were occasionally the speciality of the few women artists, such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gQLqRd7hJq0C&pg=PA984&dq=Houbraken+Leyster&hl=en&ei=0M61S8yHOuKJ4gbB1oWbCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Houbraken%20Leyster&f=false and only a few others, see Slive, 128, 320-321 and index, and Schama, 414. The outstanding woman artist of the age was Judith Leyster.]</ref>  The Dutch also led the world in botanical and other scientific drawings, prints and book illustrations. Despite the intense realism of individual flowers, paintings were composed from individual studies or even book illustrations, and blooms from very different seasons were routinely included in the same composition, and the same flowers reappear in different works, just as pieces of tableware do. There was also a fundamental unreality in that bouquets of flowers in vases were not in fact at all common in houses at the time \u2013 even the very rich displayed flowers one by one in  [[delftware]] [[Tulipiere|tulip-holder]]s.<ref>Fuchs, 111-112. Slive, 279-281, also covering unseasonal and recurring blooms.</ref>\n\nThe Dutch tradition was largely begun by [[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] (1573\u20131621), a Flemish-born flower painter who had settled in the north by the beginning of the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law [[Balthasar van der Ast]] (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a dark background, became more popular, exemplified by the works of [[Willem van Aelst]] (1627\u20131683). Painters from [[Leiden]], The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre.\n\nDead game, and birds painted live but studied from the dead, were another subgenre, as were dead fish, a staple of the Dutch diet \u2013 [[Abraham van Beijeren]] did many of these.<ref>Slive, 287-291</ref>  The Dutch were less given to the Flemish style of combining large still life elements with other types of painting \u2013 they would have been considered prideful in portraits \u2013 and the Flemish habit of specialist painters collaborating on the different elements in the same work. But this sometimes did happen \u2013 Philips Wouwerman was occasionally used to add men and horses to turn a landscape into a hunting or skirmish scene, Berchem or Adriaen van de Velde to add people or farm animals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Willem van Aelst - Bloementuil.jpg|[[Willem van Aelst]], ''Still life with a watch'' (c. 1665), with typical dark background.\nFile:Heda, Willem Claeszoon - Breakfast Table with Blackberry Pie - WGA.jpg|[[Willem Claeszoon Heda]], ''Breakfast Table with Blackberry Pie'' (1631); Heda was famous for his depiction of reflective surfaces.\nFile:Jan Davidszoon de Heem, Still-life with Books and Skull (Vanitas).JPG|[[Jan Davidszoon de Heem]], ''[[Vanitas]]'' (1629)\nFile:Jan Weenix 003.jpg|[[Jan Weenix]], ''Still Life with a Dead Peacock'' (1692), set in the gardens of a large country house.\n</gallery>\n\n==Foreign lands==\n[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazili\u00eb Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|[[Frans Post]], scene in [[Dutch Brazil]]; painted in 1662, some years after the colony was lost.]]\nFor Dutch artists, Karel van Mander's ''Schilderboeck'' was meant not only as a list of biographies, but also a source of advice for young artists. It quickly became a classic standard work for generations of young Dutch and Flemish artists in the 17th century. The book advised artists to travel and see the sights of Florence and Rome, and after 1604 many did so.  However, it is noticeable that the most important Dutch artists in all fields, figures such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, did not make the voyage.<ref name=\"Fuchs, 43\"/>\n\nMany Dutch (and Flemish) painters worked abroad or exported their work; [[printmaking]] was also an important export market, by which Rembrandt became known across Europe. The [[Dutch Gift]] to [[Charles II of England]] was a diplomatic gift which included four contemporary Dutch paintings. English painting was heavily reliant on Dutch painters, with Sir [[Peter Lely]] followed by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], developing the English portrait style established by the Flemish [[Anthony van Dyck]] before the [[English Civil War]]. The marine painters van der Velde, [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]], were among several artists who left Holland at the French invasion of 1672, which brought a collapse in the art market. They also moved to London, and the beginnings of English landscape painting were established by several less distinguished Dutch painters, such as [[Hendrick Danckerts]].\n\nThe [[Bamboccianti]] were a colony of Dutch artists who introduced the genre scene to Italy.  [[Jan Weenix]] and [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] specialized in game and birds, dead or alive, and were in demand for country house and shooting-lodge [[overdoor]]s across Northern Europe.  \n\nAlthough the Dutch control of the northeast sugar-producing region of [[Dutch Brazil]] turned out to be brief (1630-54), Governor [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen]] invited Dutch artists to paint scenes which are valuable in showing the seventeenth-century landscape and peoples of the region.<ref>R\u00fcdger Joppien. \"The Dutch Vision of Brazil: Johan Maurits and His Artists,\" in ''Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, 1604-1679: A Humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil'', ed.

The [[Dutch East Indies]] were covered much less well artistically.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Landschap_bij_de_rivier_Senhor_de_Engenho,_Brazili\u00eb_Rijksmuseum_SK-A-2334.jpeg|Landscape with sugar mill, [[Frans Post]]\nFile:Frans_Post_-_Brazilian_Landscape_with_a_Workers_House.jpg|Landscape with a worker's house, [[Frans Post]]\nFile:Albert Eckhout - Brazil.jpg|Brazilian Indian warrior, [[Albert Eckhout]]\nFile:Albert Eckhout - Bananas, goiaba e outras frutas.jpg|Bananas, [[goiaba]], and other fruits, [[Albert Eckhout]]\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Subsequent reputation==\n[[File:Philips Wouwerman - Travelers Awaiting a Ferry.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philips Wouwerman]], ''Travelers Awaiting a Ferry'' (1649); a landscape with Wouwerman's trademark highlight of a white horse.]]\n\nThe enormous success of 17th-century Dutch painting overpowered the work of subsequent generations, and no Dutch painter of the 18th century\u2014nor, arguably, a 19th-century one before [[Van Gogh]]\u2014is well known outside the Netherlands. Already by the end of the period artists were complaining that buyers were more interested in dead than living artists.\n\nIf only because of the enormous quantities produced, Dutch Golden Age painting has always formed a significant part of collections of [[Old Master]] paintings, itself a term invented in the 18th century to describe Dutch Golden Age artists. Taking only Wouwerman paintings in old royal collections, there are more than 60 in [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden]] and over 50 in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].<ref>Slive, 212</ref>  But the reputation of the period has shown many changes and shifts of emphasis. One nearly constant factor has been admiration for [[Rembrandt]], especially since the Romantic period. Other artists have shown drastic shifts in critical fortune and market price; at the end of the period some of the active Leiden [[fijnschilders]] had enormous reputations, but since the mid-19th century realist works in various genres have been far more appreciated.<ref>See Reitlinger, 11-15, 23-4, and ''passim'', and listings for individual artists</ref>\n\nVermeer was rescued from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, by which time several of his works had been re-attributed to others.

He was impressed by the quality of Vermeer's ''Milkmaid'' (illustrated at the start of this article), and the liveliness of Hals' portraits, regretting he lacked the \"patience\" to finish them properly, and lamented that Steen had not been born in Italy and formed by the [[High Renaissance]], so that his talent could have been put to better use.<ref>Slive, 144 (Vermeer), 41-2 (Hals), 173 (Steen)</ref>  By Reynold's time the moralist aspect of genre painting was no longer understood, even in the Netherlands; the famous example is the so-called ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', as it was then known, by [[Gerard ter Borch]]. This was praised by [[Goethe]] and others for the delicacy of its depiction of a father reprimanding his daughter. In fact to most (but not all) modern scholars it is a proposition scene in a brothel \u2013 there are two versions (Berlin & Amsterdam) and it is unclear whether a \"tell-tale coin\" in the man's hand has been removed or overpainted in either.<ref>Slive, 158-160 (coin quote), and Fuchs, 147-8, who uses the title ''Brothel Scene''.

According to the Hebrew worldview, all things come from God and because of this, gratitude is extremely important to the followers of Judaism. The Hebrew Scriptures are filled with the idea of gratitude. Two examples included in the psalms are \"O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever,\" and \"I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart\"  (Ps. 30:12; Ps. 9:1). The Jewish prayers also often incorporate gratitude beginning with the Shema, where the worshiper states that out of gratitude, \"You shall love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might\" (Deut. 6:5). One of the crucial blessings in the central thrice-daily prayer, the \"Amidah\", is called \"Modim\" \u2013 \"We give thanks to You\"; this is also the only blessing which is recited by the congregation together with the leader during their repetition of the Amidah. The concluding prayer, the Alenu, also speaks of gratitude by thanking God for the particular destiny of the Jewish people. Along with these prayers, faithful worshipers recite more than one hundred blessings called berachot throughout the day.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In Judaism there is also a major emphasis on gratitude for acts of human kindness and goodness.\n\n=== Christian conceptions ===\n[[File:GuadalupeNOLA15Oct07Thanks.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[New Orleans]]: Thank you message in the grotto of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] Church; added by those for whom prayer or miracles were granted]]\n\nGratitude has been said to mold and shape the entire Christian life. [[Martin Luther]] referred to gratitude as \"The basic Christian attitude\" and today it is still referred to as \"the heart of the gospel.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Christians are strongly encouraged to praise and give gratitude to their creator. In Christian gratitude, God is seen as the selfless giver of all good things and because of this, there is a deep sense of gratefulness which enables Christians to share a common bond, shaping all aspects of a follower\u2019s life. Gratitude in Christianity is an acknowledgment of God\u2019s generosity that inspires Christians to shape their own thoughts and actions around such ideals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Instead of simply a sentimental feeling, Christian gratitude is regarded as a virtue that shapes not only emotions and thoughts but also actions and deeds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Lowther|date=1918|title=Palladius, The Lausiac History|url=|journal=Translations of Christian Literature. Series I|volume=|pages=vii|via=}}</ref>\n[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] writes in his ''A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections'' that gratitude and thankfulness toward God are among the signs of true religion. Because of this interpretation, modern measures of religious spirituality include assessments of thankfulness and gratitude towards God. Allport (1950) suggested that mature religious intentions come from feelings of profound gratitude and Edwards (1746/1959) claimed that the \"affection\" of gratitude is one of the most accurate ways of finding the presence of God in a person\u2019s life. In a study done by Samuels and Lester (1985) it was contended that in a small sample of Catholic nuns and priests, out of 50 emotions, love and gratitude were the most experienced emotion towards God.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches, the most important rite is called the [[Eucharist]]; the name derives from the Greek word eucharistia for thanksgiving.<ref name=\"Seiss1896\">{{cite book |last1=Seiss |first1=Joseph A. |title=The Lutheran Quarterly, Volume 26 |date=1896 |page=318 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic conceptions ===\nThe Islamic sacred text, The Quran, is filled with the idea of gratitude.  Islam encourages its followers to be grateful and express thanks to God in all circumstances. Islamic teaching emphasizes the idea that those who are grateful will be rewarded with more. A traditional Islamic saying states that, \"The first who will be summoned to paradise are those who have praised God in every circumstance\"<ref name=\"WoodPsychologist\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = A.

The Pillar of Islam calling for daily prayer encourages believers to pray to God five times a day in order to thank him for his goodness. The pillar of fasting during the month of Ramadan is for the purpose of putting the believer in a state of gratitude.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Individual differences ==\nMuch of the recent work psychological research into gratitude has focused on the nature of individual difference in gratitude, and the consequences of being a more or less grateful person.<ref name=\"WoodPsychologist\" /> Three [[scale (social sciences)|scales]] have been developed to measure individual differences in gratitude, each of which assesses somewhat different conceptions.<ref name=\"WoodFactor\">Wood, A.

First, a longitudinal study showed that people who were more grateful coped better with a life transition. Specifically, people who were more grateful before the transition were less stressed, less depressed, and more satisfied with their relationships three months later.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = A.

Therefore, rather than indulge and sacrifice their own health\u2014a behaviour that would dismiss the efforts that other individuals invested in them\u2014they may feel compelled to live a healthier life.  Alternatively, gratitude tends to elicit positive emotions, and these positive emotions tend to divert attention to favourable possibilities in the future.

One study conducted by David DeSteno and Monica Bartlett (2010) found that gratitude is correlated with economic generosity. In this study, using an economic game, increased gratitude was shown to directly mediate increased monetary giving. From these results, this study shows that grateful people are more likely to sacrifice individual gains for communal profit (DeSteno & Bartlett, 2010).  A study conducted by McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, (2002) found similar correlations between gratitude and empathy, generosity, and helpfulness towards the creation of a social reciprocity even with strangers that is beneficial to the individuals in the short and in the middle terms.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|pmid=20364907|year=2010|last1=Desteno|first1=D|title=Gratitude as moral sentiment: Emotion-guided cooperation in economic exchange|journal=Emotion|volume=10|issue=2|pages=289\u201393|last2=Bartlett|first2=M.

Participants in the control condition were asked to describe their living room. Participants who engaged in a gratitude exercise showed increases in their experiences of positive emotion immediately after the exercise, and this effect was strongest for participants who were asked to think about a person for whom they are grateful. Participants who had grateful personalities to begin with showed the greatest benefit from these gratitude exercises. In another study concerning gratitude, participants were randomly assigned to one of six therapeutic intervention conditions designed to improve the participants' overall quality of life (Seligman et al., 2005).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = M.

This condition showed a rise in happiness scores by 10 percent and a significant fall in depression scores, results which lasted up to one month after the visit. Out of the six conditions, the longest lasting effects were associated with the act of writing \"[[gratitude journal]]s\" where participants were asked to write down three things they were grateful for every day. These participants\u2019 happiness scores also increased and continued to increase each time they were tested periodically after the experiment. In fact, the greatest benefits were usually found to occur around six months after treatment began. This exercise was so successful that although participants were only asked to continue the journal for a week, many participants continued to keep the journal long after the study was over. Similar results have been found from studies conducted by Emmons and McCullough (2003)<ref name=\"McCullough, M.E. 2002\"/> and Lyubomirsky et. all. (2005).

According to the Hebrew worldview, all things come from God and because of this, gratitude is extremely important to the followers of Judaism. The Hebrew Scriptures are filled with the idea of gratitude. Two examples included in the psalms are \"O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever,\" and \"I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart\"  (Ps. 30:12; Ps. 9:1). The Jewish prayers also often incorporate gratitude beginning with the Shema, where the worshiper states that out of gratitude, \"You shall love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might\" (Deut. 6:5). One of the crucial blessings in the central thrice-daily prayer, the \"Amidah\", is called \"Modim\" \u2013 \"We give thanks to You\"; this is also the only blessing which is recited by the congregation together with the leader during their repetition of the Amidah. The concluding prayer, the Alenu, also speaks of gratitude by thanking God for the particular destiny of the Jewish people. Along with these prayers, faithful worshipers recite more than one hundred blessings called berachot throughout the day.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In Judaism there is also a major emphasis on gratitude for acts of human kindness and goodness.\n\n=== Christian conceptions ===\n[[File:GuadalupeNOLA15Oct07Thanks.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[New Orleans]]: Thank you message in the grotto of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] Church; added by those for whom prayer or miracles were granted]]\n\nGratitude has been said to mold and shape the entire Christian life. [[Martin Luther]] referred to gratitude as \"The basic Christian attitude\" and today it is still referred to as \"the heart of the gospel.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Christians are strongly encouraged to praise and give gratitude to their creator. In Christian gratitude, God is seen as the selfless giver of all good things and because of this, there is a deep sense of gratefulness which enables Christians to share a common bond, shaping all aspects of a follower\u2019s life. Gratitude in Christianity is an acknowledgment of God\u2019s generosity that inspires Christians to shape their own thoughts and actions around such ideals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Instead of simply a sentimental feeling, Christian gratitude is regarded as a virtue that shapes not only emotions and thoughts but also actions and deeds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Lowther|date=1918|title=Palladius, The Lausiac History|url=|journal=Translations of Christian Literature. Series I|volume=|pages=vii|via=}}</ref>\n[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] writes in his ''A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections'' that gratitude and thankfulness toward God are among the signs of true religion. Because of this interpretation, modern measures of religious spirituality include assessments of thankfulness and gratitude towards God. Allport (1950) suggested that mature religious intentions come from feelings of profound gratitude and Edwards (1746/1959) claimed that the \"affection\" of gratitude is one of the most accurate ways of finding the presence of God in a person\u2019s life. In a study done by Samuels and Lester (1985) it was contended that in a small sample of Catholic nuns and priests, out of 50 emotions, love and gratitude were the most experienced emotion towards God.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches, the most important rite is called the [[Eucharist]]; the name derives from the Greek word eucharistia for thanksgiving.<ref name=\"Seiss1896\">{{cite book |last1=Seiss |first1=Joseph A. |title=The Lutheran Quarterly, Volume 26 |date=1896 |page=318 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic conceptions ===\nThe Islamic sacred text, The Quran, is filled with the idea of gratitude.  Islam encourages its followers to be grateful and express thanks to God in all circumstances. Islamic teaching emphasizes the idea that those who are grateful will be rewarded with more. A traditional Islamic saying states that, \"The first who will be summoned to paradise are those who have praised God in every circumstance\"<ref name=\"WoodPsychologist\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = A.

The Pillar of Islam calling for daily prayer encourages believers to pray to God five times a day in order to thank him for his goodness. The pillar of fasting during the month of Ramadan is for the purpose of putting the believer in a state of gratitude.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Individual differences ==\nMuch of the recent work psychological research into gratitude has focused on the nature of individual difference in gratitude, and the consequences of being a more or less grateful person.<ref name=\"WoodPsychologist\" /> Three [[scale (social sciences)|scales]] have been developed to measure individual differences in gratitude, each of which assesses somewhat different conceptions.<ref name=\"WoodFactor\">Wood, A.

Therefore, rather than indulge and sacrifice their own health\u2014a behaviour that would dismiss the efforts that other individuals invested in them\u2014they may feel compelled to live a healthier life.  Alternatively, gratitude tends to elicit positive emotions, and these positive emotions tend to divert attention to favourable possibilities in the future.  Individuals become more inclined to engage in behaviours that could benefit this future, such as healthy eating.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Relationship to altruism===\nGratitude has also been shown to improve a person\u2019s altruistic tendencies. One study conducted by David DeSteno and Monica Bartlett (2010) found that gratitude is correlated with economic generosity. In this study, using an economic game, increased gratitude was shown to directly mediate increased monetary giving. From these results, this study shows that grateful people are more likely to sacrifice individual gains for communal profit (DeSteno & Bartlett, 2010).  A study conducted by McCullough, Emmons, & Tsang, (2002) found similar correlations between gratitude and empathy, generosity, and helpfulness towards the creation of a social reciprocity even with strangers that is beneficial to the individuals in the short and in the middle terms.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|pmid=20364907|year=2010|last1=Desteno|first1=D|title=Gratitude as moral sentiment: Emotion-guided cooperation in economic exchange|journal=Emotion|volume=10|issue=2|pages=289\u201393|last2=Bartlett|first2=M.

Participants in the control condition were asked to describe their living room. Participants who engaged in a gratitude exercise showed increases in their experiences of positive emotion immediately after the exercise, and this effect was strongest for participants who were asked to think about a person for whom they are grateful. Participants who had grateful personalities to begin with showed the greatest benefit from these gratitude exercises. In another study concerning gratitude, participants were randomly assigned to one of six therapeutic intervention conditions designed to improve the participants' overall quality of life (Seligman et al., 2005).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Seligman | first1 = M.

This condition showed a rise in happiness scores by 10 percent and a significant fall in depression scores, results which lasted up to one month after the visit. Out of the six conditions, the longest lasting effects were associated with the act of writing \"[[gratitude journal]]s\" where participants were asked to write down three things they were grateful for every day. These participants\u2019 happiness scores also increased and continued to increase each time they were tested periodically after the experiment. In fact, the greatest benefits were usually found to occur around six months after treatment began. This exercise was so successful that although participants were only asked to continue the journal for a week, many participants continued to keep the journal long after the study was over.

These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.<ref name=suck/>\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\".

Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.\n\nSome frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female [[protagonist]],<ref name=suck/> thematic use of the [[Pink|color pink]] (along with [[Pink#In culture|metaphorical allusions of the color]]),<ref name=click/> and romance and/or dating-based storylines.<ref name=twilight/> Longtime producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] has remarked about the plots, \"How do you cope with money and love?\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\nWomen are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings.  Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick.  However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.\n\nFemale [[MSN.com]] commentator Kim Morgan has written,\n{{quote|[C]inema just wouldn't be the same without movies for and about women.

It has its roots in the \"[[Woman's film|women's pictures]]\" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the ''[[film noir]]'' of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Chick Flicks: Contemporary Women at the Movies|last = Ferriss|first = Suzanne and Mallory Young|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title= The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory?

[[Brandon French]] notes that the women's films of the 1950s \"shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title= On The Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties |last= French |first= Brandon |publisher= Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. |year= 1978 |isbn= 0804422206 |location= New York |pages= xxii-xxiii |url= https://archive.org/details/onvergeofrevoltw0000fren }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1961 in film|1961 film]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', commonly known as one of the \"classic\" films from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age of cinema]], is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with [[loneliness]], obsessive [[materialism]], and happy endings.<ref name=suck/><ref name=stylecaster/> Author [[Molly Haskell]] has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now \"sing a different tune.\" She feels that they are \"more defiant and upbeat, [[post-modern]] and [[post-feminist]].\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nIn the U.S. in the [[1980s in film|1980s]], a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.<ref name=suck/>\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\". He also said, \"they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about.\" According to [[Fandango.com]], more than 75% of ''Twilight''{{'s}} opening-weekend audience was female.<ref name=\"twilight\" />\n\n==Criticism of the term ==\nThe term ''chick flick'' has generated several negative responses from the modern [[Feminist movement|feminist]] community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of ''The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?'', Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are \"an attempt to lump together an entire gender\u2019s interests into one genre.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Stereotypes And The Logic Of Social Relations|last = Rimashevskaia|first = Natal'ia|date = 2008|journal = Russian Social Science Review|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 35\u201348|doi = 10.1080/10611428.2008.11065289|pmid = }}</ref> There is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that [[gender stereotypes]] further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their \"human and intellectual potential.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nMore criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are [[Microaggressions|micro-aggressions]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = SAGE Reference - Encyclopedia of Human Services and Diversity |url= http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-human-services-and-diversity|doi = 10.4135/9781483346663|isbn= 9781452287485|first = Linwood|last = Cousins|year= 2014}}</ref> Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a \"race, gender, age, and ability.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Critique of the genre ==\nDespite the genre's popular successes, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common.
