The film was directed by [[Hiroyuki Imaishi]] and written by [[Kazuki Nakashima]], both of whom had worked together on ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'' in 2007 and ''[[Kill la Kill]]'' in 2013, with Nakashima and Trigger credited for the original work. It features character and [[mecha]] designs by Shigeto Koyama, [[3DCG]] animation by [[Sanzigen]] and music by [[Hiroyuki Sawano]].  ''Promare'' was released in Japanese theaters on May 24, 2019 by [[Toho]].<ref name=caststaff />\n\n==Plot==\nThirty years prior, Earth suffered a calamity known as the Great World Blaze, wherein fires from mass [[spontaneous human combustion]]s killed half the world's population. Certain humans developed [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] abilities during and subsequent to the event, and became known as the Burnish. In the present, Galo Thymos lives in the city of Promepolis as a member of the [[firefighting]] group Burning Rescue, who respond to incidents involving the purported Burnish terrorist sect Mad Burnish.\n\nWhile responding to a Mad Burnish attack, Galo defeats their leader Lio Fotia. Lio is brought into custody by Freeze Force, a police force overseen by Promepolis governor Kray Foresight. Lio orchestrates a mass breakout while detained at a prison for Burnish and retreats with the refugees to a frozen lake, where they are discovered by Galo. After being incapacitated by Lio, Galo witnesses him attempt to revive a mortally injured Burnish using a [[Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth]] flame transfer technique. Lio reveals to Galo that Kray is capturing Burnish for use in [[Human subject research|human experiments]].\n\nGalo confronts Kray, who informs him that the Earth will soon be destroyed by an uncontrollable surge of magma from the earth's core. He has discovered that the abilities of the Burnish can be used to create a [[warp drive]], which he intends to use to flee Earth with a select portion of humanity. Meanwhile, Freeze Force track the Burnish remnants and recapture all but Lio. Lio returns to Promepolis to confront Kray, though Galo intervenes and retreats with Lio to the frozen lake.\n\nLio's flames melt the lake's ice and reveal a laboratory run by a holographic projection of Deus Prometh, a scientist murdered by Kray. Deus explains that the Burnish are able to communicate with the Promare, a race of inter-dimensional flame beings that reside in Earth's core; the surging magma is a side effect of subjecting the Promare to pain, and Kray's experiments on the Burnish are accelerating its growth. In a [[mecha]] of Deus' design, known as the [[Deus ex machina|Deus X Machina]], Galo and Lio return to Promepolis to confront Kray. In the battle, Kray reveals that he is a Burnish and tries to kill Galo, whom Lio protects with his flames. Kray then attempts to use Lio to power the warp drive. Though this nearly kills Lio, Galo revives him using the mouth-to-mouth technique.\n\nTogether, Galo and Lio combine the drive and their mecha to protect life on Earth while allowing the Promare to envelop the surface, causing the Promare to burn out and vanish completely. The Burnish become normal humans, and Galo and Lio resolve to rebuild the world together.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Galo Thymos|\u30ac\u30ed\u30fb\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b9|Garo Timosu}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-07-06/trigger-reveals-more-details-on-promare-anime/.133947|title=Trigger Reveals More Details on Promare Anime|date=July 7, 2018|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenichi Matsuyama]]|Billy Kametz}}<ref name=\"MainCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-01-22/trigger-xflag-promare-anime-film-reveals-main-cast-may-debut-new-trailer/.142429|title=Trigger, XFlag's Promare Anime Film Reveals Main Cast, May Debut, New Trailer|date=January 22, 2019|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DubCast\">{{cite web |last1=Sherman |first1=Jennifer |title=Promare Anime Film's English-dubbed Trailer Streamed (Updated) |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-27/promare-anime-film-english-dubbed-trailer-streamed/.150465 |website=Anime News Network |publisher=News |accessdate=August 27, 2019 |language=en |date=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\n:The brash new member of Burning Rescue.

It features character and [[mecha]] designs by Shigeto Koyama, [[3DCG]] animation by [[Sanzigen]] and music by [[Hiroyuki Sawano]].  ''Promare'' was released in Japanese theaters on May 24, 2019 by [[Toho]].<ref name=caststaff />\n\n==Plot==\nThirty years prior, Earth suffered a calamity known as the Great World Blaze, wherein fires from mass [[spontaneous human combustion]]s killed half the world's population. Certain humans developed [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] abilities during and subsequent to the event, and became known as the Burnish. In the present, Galo Thymos lives in the city of Promepolis as a member of the [[firefighting]] group Burning Rescue, who respond to incidents involving the purported Burnish terrorist sect Mad Burnish.\n\nWhile responding to a Mad Burnish attack, Galo defeats their leader Lio Fotia. Lio is brought into custody by Freeze Force, a police force overseen by Promepolis governor Kray Foresight. Lio orchestrates a mass breakout while detained at a prison for Burnish and retreats with the refugees to a frozen lake, where they are discovered by Galo. After being incapacitated by Lio, Galo witnesses him attempt to revive a mortally injured Burnish using a [[Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth]] flame transfer technique. Lio reveals to Galo that Kray is capturing Burnish for use in [[Human subject research|human experiments]].\n\nGalo confronts Kray, who informs him that the Earth will soon be destroyed by an uncontrollable surge of magma from the earth's core. He has discovered that the abilities of the Burnish can be used to create a [[warp drive]], which he intends to use to flee Earth with a select portion of humanity. Meanwhile, Freeze Force track the Burnish remnants and recapture all but Lio. Lio returns to Promepolis to confront Kray, though Galo intervenes and retreats with Lio to the frozen lake.\n\nLio's flames melt the lake's ice and reveal a laboratory run by a holographic projection of Deus Prometh, a scientist murdered by Kray. Deus explains that the Burnish are able to communicate with the Promare, a race of inter-dimensional flame beings that reside in Earth's core; the surging magma is a side effect of subjecting the Promare to pain, and Kray's experiments on the Burnish are accelerating its growth. In a [[mecha]] of Deus' design, known as the [[Deus ex machina|Deus X Machina]], Galo and Lio return to Promepolis to confront Kray. In the battle, Kray reveals that he is a Burnish and tries to kill Galo, whom Lio protects with his flames. Kray then attempts to use Lio to power the warp drive. Though this nearly kills Lio, Galo revives him using the mouth-to-mouth technique.\n\nTogether, Galo and Lio combine the drive and their mecha to protect life on Earth while allowing the Promare to envelop the surface, causing the Promare to burn out and vanish completely. The Burnish become normal humans, and Galo and Lio resolve to rebuild the world together.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Galo Thymos|\u30ac\u30ed\u30fb\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b9|Garo Timosu}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-07-06/trigger-reveals-more-details-on-promare-anime/.133947|title=Trigger Reveals More Details on Promare Anime|date=July 7, 2018|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=December 10, 2018}}</ref>\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenichi Matsuyama]]|Billy Kametz}}<ref name=\"MainCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-01-22/trigger-xflag-promare-anime-film-reveals-main-cast-may-debut-new-trailer/.142429|title=Trigger, XFlag's Promare Anime Film Reveals Main Cast, May Debut, New Trailer|date=January 22, 2019|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DubCast\">{{cite web |last1=Sherman |first1=Jennifer |title=Promare Anime Film's English-dubbed Trailer Streamed (Updated) |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-27/promare-anime-film-english-dubbed-trailer-streamed/.150465 |website=Anime News Network |publisher=News |accessdate=August 27, 2019 |language=en |date=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\n:The brash new member of Burning Rescue.
