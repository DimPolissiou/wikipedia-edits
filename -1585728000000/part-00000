The first three quakes, all registering in the planet's [[List of earthquakes in 1960#By magnitude|top 10 by magnitude for 1960]], are grouped together as the 1960 Concepci\u00f3n earthquakes. The first of these was the 8.1 [[Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub>]] Concepci\u00f3n earthquake at {{nowrap|06:02 [[UTC-4]]}} on 21 May 1960. Its epicenter was near [[Curanilahue]]. Telecommunications to southern Chile were cut off and President [[Jorge Alessandri]] cancelled the traditional ceremony of the [[Battle of Iquique]] memorial holiday to oversee the emergency assistance efforts. The second and third Concepci\u00f3n earthquakes occurred the next day at {{nowrap|06:32 UTC-4}} (7.1 M<sub>w</sub>) and {{nowrap|14:55 UTC-4}} (7.8 M<sub>w</sub>) on 22 May.

Extensive areas of the city were flooded. The electricity and water systems of Valdivia were totally destroyed. Witnesses reported [[Soil liquefaction|underground water flowing up through the soil]]. Despite the heavy rains of 21 May, the city was without a water supply. The river turned brown with sediment from landslides and was full of floating debris, including entire houses. The lack of [[potable water]] became a serious problem in one of Chile's rainiest regions.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}\n\nThe earthquake did not strike all the territory with the same strength; measured with the [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli]] scale, tectonically depressed areas suffered heavier damage.

Various studies have placed it at 9.4\u20139.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]]. It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 [[GMT]], 15:11 local time), and lasted approximately 10 minutes.

Given that the officers connected to the attempted coup were all Christian, Prime Minister [[Sirima Bandaranaike]] had preferred appointing Udugama over the more senior Heyn, given that the former was a Buddhist and kinsmen from a Kandyan Radala family. \n\n====Army commander====\nIn July 1966, Major General Udugama was suspended and arrested under emergency regulations following allegations of [[1966 alleged Ceylonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempting stage a coup]] against the government of Prime Minister [[Dudley Senanayake]]. Colonel Heyn, who was acting army commander in Major General Udugama's absence abroad, continued until he was confirmed as army commander on 11 November 1966 with the promotion to the rank of [[brigadier]]. He was later promoted to the rank of [[major general]] and held the post till his retirement on 30 September 1967.\n\n===Decorations===\nFor wartime service, Heyn had earned the [[War Medal 1939\u20131945]], and for service in the Ceylon Army, he received the [[Ceylon Armed Services Long Service Medal]], the [[Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal]] and the [[Ceylon Armed Services Inauguration Medal]].\n\n==Later life==\nIn his later years he managed the Sri Lanka cricket team and served as the head of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka|Cricket Board]], as well as on the Sri Lanka Olympic Council.\n\nIn 1990, the Government of Sri Lanka awarded Heyn the title of [[Deshabandu]], the third highest Sri Lankan national honour, for meritorious service.<ref>http://www.presidentsoffice.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=89&Itemid=236</ref>\n\n==Family==\nGeneral Heyn and his wife Edna had two sons, Richard and [[David Heyn|David]]. Richard represented Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) at Field Hockey and played Cricket at top-grade club level. David represented Sri Lanka at Cricket and played Field Hockey at top-grade club level.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060326024624/http://www.army.lk/co.php www.army.lk]\n*[http://sundaytimes.lk/980208/sports2.html#LABEL3 B.R.Heyn: The man who caught the \u2018Don\u2019, An officer and a gentleman, By Bhahi Sampanthan]\n*{{cricketarchive|id=26290}}\n*{{cricinfo|id=49187}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060707163944/http://www.army.lk/org2.php Parade Commander Major B.R.
