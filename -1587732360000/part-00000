When the fossil was found the hip bones were above the skull and the leg bones were intertwined with the ribs. The large size and the excellent condition of the bones were also surprising. The skull was {{cvt|1394|mm}} long, and most of the teeth were still intact. After the group completed excavating the bones, each block was covered in [[burlap]] and coated in [[plaster]], followed by a transfer to the offices of The Black Hills Institute where they began to clean the bones.\n\n==Dispute and auction==\n[[File:Sue skull.jpg|thumb|left|Sue's skull]]Soon after the fossils were found, a dispute arose over their legal ownership. The Black Hills Institute had obtained permission from the owner of the land, Maurice Williams, to excavate and remove the skeleton, and had, according to Larson, paid Williams {{USD|5000}} for the remains.<ref>Cherry, Miriam: [http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/contract_law_beyond/ A T-Rex Named Sue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407131725/http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/contract_law_beyond/ |date=April 7, 2007 }}, Retrieved on April 9, 2007</ref> Williams later claimed that the money had not been for the sale of the fossil and that he had only allowed Larson to remove and clean the fossil for a later sale.<ref name=\"Larson\" /> Williams was a member of the [[Sioux]]<!--This is the specific Sioux group that lives in this region.--> tribe, and the tribe claimed the bones belonged to them.

The government transferred the remains to the [[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology]], where the skeleton was stored until the penal and civil legal disputes were settled. The United States Senate voted to not confirm the appointment of Kevin Schieffer as [[United States Attorney for the District of South Dakota]] after his controversial handling of the penal case. In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995.\n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property. Many were then worried that the fossil would end up in a private collection where people would not be able to observe it.<ref>Monastersky, Richard: [http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/sakesue.htm For the Sake of Sue] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211201943/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/sakesue.htm |date=December 11, 2007 }}, Retrieved on December 6, 2007</ref><ref>Poling, Jeff: [http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/reserve.htm Reserving \"Sue\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210185237/http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/sue/reserve.htm |date=December 10, 2007 }}, Retrieved on December 6, 2007</ref> [[Field Museum of Natural History|The Field Museum]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] was also concerned about this possibility, and decided to attempt to purchase Sue.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013. A ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'' episode said that the death occurred in a seasonal stream bed, which washed away some small bones. During life, this carnivore received several injuries and suffered from numerous pathologies.<ref name=\"Relf\">Relf, Pat. ''A Dinosaur Named Sue: The Story of the Colossal Fossil''. 2000.</ref> An injury to the right shoulder region of Sue resulted in a damaged shoulder blade, a [[Tendon avulsion|torn tendon]] in the right arm due most likely from a struggle with prey, and three broken ribs.<ref name=\"rothschild-2001\">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|journal=PLOS One|language=English|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009|pmc=2748709|pmid=19789646|volume=4|issue=9|page=e7288}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound.

In 1996, Larson was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of [[real property]], and the remains were returned in 1995.\n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with [[Sotheby's]] to auction the property.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|journal=PLOS One|language=English|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009|pmc=2748709|pmid=19789646|volume=4|issue=9|page=e7288}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound.

The characters are colorful creatures with simple designs based on animals, objects, or people. In 2004, beginning with the Tamagotchi Plus/Connection, a second wave of Tamagotchi toys emerged, featuring a different graphic design by JINCO<ref>{{cite web|title=Character |url=http://www.jinco100.com/|website=JINCO100%|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations. However, the story behind the games remained the same: Tamagotchis are a small [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature.<ref name=\"rtfm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tamatalk.com/IB/topic/116745-original-instruction-manuals/ |title=Original Instruction Manuals}}</ref>  The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides, with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter, happier, and requires less attention. Gameplay can vary widely between models, and some models, such as [[List of Tamagotchi releases#TamagoChu|TamagoChu]], require little to no care from the player.\n\n[[Bandai]] released the Tamagotchi in Japan in November 1996, initially marketing them exclusively to teenage girls.<ref name=NGen34>{{cite magazine|title=Finding Companionship in a Digital Age |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=34|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=October 1997|pages=56-63}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nUpon activating the toy, an egg appears on the screen. After setting the clock on the device, the egg will wiggle for several minutes, and then hatch into a small [[pet]]. In later versions, inputting the player's name and birthday is also required when setting the clock, and at birth, the player can name the pet and learn of its family group and/or gender. The player can care for the pet as much or as little as they choose, and the outcome depends on the player's actions.  The first Tamagotchis could only be paused by going to set the clock, effectively stopping the passage of time in the game, but in later models a pause function was included.\n\nPets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet meter, and Discipline meter to determine how healthy and well behaved the pet is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of [[bread]] or [[hamburger]]) or a snack (usually a piece of [[candy]] or [[cake]]). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way the pet will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the \"scold\" option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave [[feces|droppings]] around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained.\n\nIf the pet gets sick, a skull icon appears next to the pet as it sits still at the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. The pet can become sick for a number of reasons, such as overfeeding of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. The pet can die if sickness is left unchecked. The pet can be cured by pressing the \"Medicine\" option, however it may need to be pressed more than once. Usually, a pet will not play or accept a meal when sick.\n\n===Life cycle===\nThe pet goes through several distinct stages of development throughout its life cycle. Each stage lasts a set amount of time, depending on the model of the toy, and when it reaches a new stage, the toy plays a jingle, and the pet's appearance changes.  The pet can \"die\" due to poor care, old age, sickness, and in a few versions, predators. The pet's life cycle stages are '''Baby''', '''Child''', '''Teenager''', and '''Adult'''. Later Tamagotchi models have added a '''Senior''' model.  Usually the pet's age will increase once it has awakened from its sleep time.\n\nPoor care can cause a pet to die, but it can also die of old age. If an old pet dies without producing offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when the pet dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death, or simply a floating [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to indicate its return to its home planet. Pressing the right button shows the age at which the pet died. After the pet dies, a player can restart the game.\n\n===New mechanics===\nIn recent models, the player earns currency called Gotchi Points while playing games, and can use the currency in an in-game shop to buy different foods, toys, accessories, or even room decorations for the pet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Connectivity====\nUsing infrared communication, two players can link their toys and the pets may form friendships, play games, exchange gifts, and even marry. Infrared connection was introduced with the Plus/Connection, but the Japanese Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi was the first model to interact with a computer. Since then, many subsequent models have also been able to interact with the E-Tamago or Tamatown websites by using alphanumeric codes generated by the toy to log into the website's [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game.  After generating a code, the toy remains paused until the player either enters a logout code or cancels.  The player may play minigames in the town to earn Gotchi Points, or use Gotchi Points to buy items in the town shops.  To transfer points and items back to the toy, the player signs out of the Flash game and is given a code to input back into the toy. Newer models, such as the Tamagotchi 4U and the Tamagotchi 4U+ can connect to other Tamagotchi 4U units, as well as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]], using [[near-field communication]]. Unlike previous models, the Tamagotchi 4U does not have infrared, which consequently caused it to sell rather poorly.You can kill them by buying too many things.\n\n====Marriage and family====\nThe Mesutchi and Osutchi Tamagotchis were the first to introduce marriages and offspring, and the feature returned in the Plus/Connection and subsequent models.  Two players with a male and female pet may link their toys and allow the pets to develop a friendship and fall in love.  Once the pets have raised their relationship meter sufficiently, the pets may marry. The player can also choose to have their pet marry a random pet brought in by the \"Matchmaker.\"  Once married, the female will eventually produce two eggs, keeping one and leaving one with the male. Since the parent will automatically guide the baby's life, the only care it needs from the player is medicine in the case of sickness. After a few days the parent will leave, and the player is left to care for a new generation. This can continue for as long as the player manages to care for the pets.<br />\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced the idea of character \"families\" or \"groups.\"  These \"families\" are a kind of [[Taxonomy (general)|classification]] for characters obtainable in the game, grouped mainly by appearance, though they are also associated with certain skills. A character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be of the female's group. ''Tamagotchi M!X'', the latest Japanese release, has a notable change to this feature; in this release, Tamagotchi offspring have merged traits from both of their parents.You don\u2019t have to marry with tamagotchi characters.It won\u2019t kill them.\n\n====Other====\nWith the many different versions of the toy, there are other less common mechanics that influence the pet's growth, including but not limited to friendship with the player, varying types of skills, and career.\nThe Kocugo Kinsei  Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced Skills, which can be built by playing certain games with the pet, or using certain toys or foods bought from the E-Tamago or in-game shops.  Having certain skills can help the pet obtain a career, and if built up high enough, can unlock special characters.\n\n==Releases==\n{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | text=When we were stuck on talk of the spectacular 3D graphics of ''[[Super Mario 64|Mario 64]]'' and racing games, we saw a huge hit in the form of Tamagotchi \u2014 a tiny key chain boasting pictures made up of no more than 10 or 20 dots.

Along with the original Tamagotchi, the first wave of Tamagotchi toys included Christmas, angel, and ocean themed versions. The newer versions began in 2004 with the Tamagotchi Plus, and the most recent version is the Japanese ''Tamagotchi Meets'', which was released overseas in 2019 as ''Tamagotchi On''.\n\nIn early 2013, Bandai released an enhanced version of the original 1996 Tamagotchi as a free [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app named \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.\". A sequel to the game, \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.

The film, ''[[Tamagotchi: The Movie]]'', focuses on Mametchi, along with his friends Memetchi and Kuchipatchi. Introduced are Tanpopo, a human girl who Mametchi accidentally transports to the Tamagotchi Planet; and Chamametchi, the younger sister of Mametchi who is born during the film's events. ''Tamagotchi: The Movie'' was released on December 15, 2007, and was distributed by [[Toho|Toho Co.]] The film opened at number 3 at the box office on opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-17/japanese-box-office-december-15-16-tamagotchi-at-no.3 |title=Japanese Box Office, December 15\u201316: Tamagotchi at #3 |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> On May 31, 2008, [[North America]]n distributor [[Bandai Visual|Bandai Entertainment]] announced they had acquired the rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-30/bandai-entertaiment-gets-tamagotchi-feature-film |title=Bandai Entertainment Gets Tamagotchi Feature Film |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref> The movie's first English release was a direct-to-DVD version, released on June 3, 2009 in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]].

This film, introducing a new Tamagotchi known as Hapihapitchi, was later released on DVD, on June 26, 2009. Unlike the first film, ''Happiest Story in the Universe'' has not been dubbed in English, but an extremely rare English dub existed in the Philippines. [[Madman Entertainment]] intended to dub ''Happiest Story in the Universe!'', but the dub was cancelled for unknown reasons.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Bandai announced a new Tamagotchi short film called ''Tamagotchi: Secret Delivery Operation''.

The characters are colorful creatures with simple designs based on animals, objects, or people. In 2004, beginning with the Tamagotchi Plus/Connection, a second wave of Tamagotchi toys emerged, featuring a different graphic design by JINCO<ref>{{cite web|title=Character |url=http://www.jinco100.com/|website=JINCO100%|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> and gameplay which elaborated upon the first generations. However, the story behind the games remained the same: Tamagotchis are a small [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] species that deposited an egg on Earth to see what life was like, and it is up to the player to raise the egg into an adult creature.<ref name=\"rtfm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tamatalk.com/IB/topic/116745-original-instruction-manuals/ |title=Original Instruction Manuals}}</ref>  The creature goes through several stages of growth, and will develop differently depending on the care the player provides, with better care resulting in an adult creature that is smarter, happier, and requires less attention. Gameplay can vary widely between models, and some models, such as [[List of Tamagotchi releases#TamagoChu|TamagoChu]], require little to no care from the player.\n\n[[Bandai]] released the Tamagotchi in Japan in November 1996, initially marketing them exclusively to teenage girls.<ref name=NGen34>{{cite magazine|title=Finding Companionship in a Digital Age |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=34|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=October 1997|pages=56-63}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nUpon activating the toy, an egg appears on the screen. After setting the clock on the device, the egg will wiggle for several minutes, and then hatch into a small [[pet]]. In later versions, inputting the player's name and birthday is also required when setting the clock, and at birth, the player can name the pet and learn of its family group and/or gender. The player can care for the pet as much or as little as they choose, and the outcome depends on the player's actions.  The first Tamagotchis could only be paused by going to set the clock, effectively stopping the passage of time in the game, but in later models a pause function was included.\n\nPets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet meter, and Discipline meter to determine how healthy and well behaved the pet is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of [[bread]] or [[hamburger]]) or a snack (usually a piece of [[candy]] or [[cake]]). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way the pet will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the \"scold\" option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave [[feces|droppings]] around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained.\n\nIf the pet gets sick, a skull icon appears next to the pet as it sits still at the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. The pet can become sick for a number of reasons, such as overfeeding of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. The pet can die if sickness is left unchecked. The pet can be cured by pressing the \"Medicine\" option, however it may need to be pressed more than once. Usually, a pet will not play or accept a meal when sick.\n\n===Life cycle===\nThe pet goes through several distinct stages of development throughout its life cycle. Each stage lasts a set amount of time, depending on the model of the toy, and when it reaches a new stage, the toy plays a jingle, and the pet's appearance changes.  The pet can \"die\" due to poor care, old age, sickness, and in a few versions, predators. The pet's life cycle stages are '''Baby''', '''Child''', '''Teenager''', and '''Adult'''. Later Tamagotchi models have added a '''Senior''' model.  Usually the pet's age will increase once it has awakened from its sleep time.\n\nPoor care can cause a pet to die, but it can also die of old age. If an old pet dies without producing offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when the pet dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death, or simply a floating [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to indicate its return to its home planet. Pressing the right button shows the age at which the pet died. After the pet dies, a player can restart the game.\n\n===New mechanics===\nIn recent models, the player earns currency called Gotchi Points while playing games, and can use the currency in an in-game shop to buy different foods, toys, accessories, or even room decorations for the pet.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Connectivity====\nUsing infrared communication, two players can link their toys and the pets may form friendships, play games, exchange gifts, and even marry. Infrared connection was introduced with the Plus/Connection, but the Japanese Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi was the first model to interact with a computer. Since then, many subsequent models have also been able to interact with the E-Tamago or Tamatown websites by using alphanumeric codes generated by the toy to log into the website's [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game.  After generating a code, the toy remains paused until the player either enters a logout code or cancels.  The player may play minigames in the town to earn Gotchi Points, or use Gotchi Points to buy items in the town shops.  To transfer points and items back to the toy, the player signs out of the Flash game and is given a code to input back into the toy. Newer models, such as the Tamagotchi 4U and the Tamagotchi 4U+ can connect to other Tamagotchi 4U units, as well as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]], using [[near-field communication]]. Unlike previous models, the Tamagotchi 4U does not have infrared, which consequently caused it to sell rather poorly.\n\n====Marriage and family====\nThe Mesutchi and Osutchi Tamagotchis were the first to introduce marriages and offspring, and the feature returned in the Plus/Connection and subsequent models.  Two players with a male and female pet may link their toys and allow the pets to develop a friendship and fall in love.  Once the pets have raised their relationship meter sufficiently, the pets may marry. The player can also choose to have their pet marry a random pet brought in by the \"Matchmaker.\"  Once married, the female will eventually produce two eggs, keeping one and leaving one with the male. Since the parent will automatically guide the baby's life, the only care it needs from the player is medicine in the case of sickness. After a few days the parent will leave, and the player is left to care for a new generation. This can continue for as long as the player manages to care for the pets.<br />\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced the idea of character \"families\" or \"groups.\"  These \"families\" are a kind of [[Taxonomy (general)|classification]] for characters obtainable in the game, grouped mainly by appearance, though they are also associated with certain skills. A character of one group cannot grow into an adult of a different group, and if two pets of different groups marry and have an egg, the baby will be of the female's group. ''Tamagotchi M!X'', the latest Japanese release, has a notable change to this feature; in this release, Tamagotchi offspring have merged traits from both of their parents.\n\n====Other====\nWith the many different versions of the toy, there are other less common mechanics that influence the pet's growth, including but not limited to friendship with the player, varying types of skills, and career.\nThe Chou Jinsei Enjoy Tamagotchi also introduced Skills, which can be built by playing certain games with the pet, or using certain toys or foods bought from the E-Tamago or in-game shops.  Having certain skills can help the pet obtain a career, and if built up high enough, can unlock special characters.\n\n==Releases==\n{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | text=When we were stuck on talk of the spectacular 3D graphics of ''[[Super Mario 64|Mario 64]]'' and racing games, we saw a huge hit in the form of Tamagotchi \u2014 a tiny key chain boasting pictures made up of no more than 10 or 20 dots.

The newer versions began in 2004 with the Tamagotchi Plus, and the most recent version is the Japanese ''Tamagotchi Meets'', which was released overseas in 2019 as ''Tamagotchi On''.\n\nIn early 2013, Bandai released an enhanced version of the original 1996 Tamagotchi as a free [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app named \"Tamagotchi L.i.f.e.\".

Stage set by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] (1781\u20131841) for an 1815 production]]\n\"'''O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn'''\" (\"Oh, don't tremble, my dear son\") is the first [[aria]] performed by the Queen of the Night (a famous [[coloratura soprano]] role) in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[singspiel]] ''[[The Magic Flute]] (Die Zauberfl\u00f6te)''. It is not as well known as the Queen's second aria, \"[[Queen of the Night aria|Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen]]\", though no less demanding; the aria requires a soprano coloratura with extremely high [[tessitura]] and great vocal flexibility.\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe role of Queen of the Night demands a range that until Mozart's time was almost never called for, and this opened the door for later composers to call for specific kind of singers ([[Lyric soprano|lyric]], [[Dramatic soprano|dramatic]], [[Coloratura soprano|coloratura]] etc.), rather than just \"soprano\", \"tenor\" etc.<ref name=Coffin>{{cite book\n|title= Coloratura, Lyric and Dramatic Soprano, Vol. 1\n|last= Coffin\n|first= Berton\n|year= 1960\n|publisher= Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.\n|isbn= 978-0-8108-0188-2\n|url-access= registration\n|url= https://archive.org/details/singersrepertoir0000coff\n}}</ref>\n\nThe part, in whole, includes two arias, ''O zittre nicht'' and ''Der H\u00f6lle Rache''. The first calls for a rather lyric and flexible voice while the second requires a dramatic and powerful voice. Originally, the part was written for [[Josepha Weber|Josepha Hofer]], the composer's sister-in-law, whose voice possessed both of these qualities. Most modern performers are specialists in either lyric or dramatic style. This, along with the difficulty of the two arias, makes the role of the Queen of the Night one of the most demanding in operatic repertoire.\n\n==Context in the opera==\n\nIn the preceding scene, Prince Tamino was shown a portrait of the Queen's daughter Pamina and fell instantly in love with her, singing of his feelings in the aria \"[[Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch\u00f6n]]\". The Queen then makes a dramatic entrance, preceded by the Three Ladies calling to Tamino \"Sie kommt! Sie kommt!\" (\"[Here] she comes!\"). The grand entrance music for the Queen is in [[B-flat major|B-flat]], marked ''Allegro maestoso'', with the following stage direction:\n\n:''The mountains [in the scenery] are parted, and the stage is transformed into a magnificent chamber. The Queen is seated on a throne adorned with shining stars.''<ref>Dover edition (1985, 41).  Original German:  \"Die Berge teilen sich auseinander, und das Theater verwandelt sich in ein pr\u00e4chtiges Gemach. DIE K\u00d6NIGIN sitzt auf einem Thron, welcher mit transparenten Sternen geziert ist.\"  (Source:  NMA edition, linked below)</ref>\n\nNot all modern productions adhere to this prescription.\n\nIn the aria, the Queen first quiets Tamino's fears and attempts to befriend him, then tells the sad, although misleading, tale of Pamina's abduction by Sarastro, and finally makes a stirring plea to Tamino to rescue her daughter. As the aria ends, the Queen and the Three Ladies leave the stage, leaving the astonished Tamino to ponder his task and gather his resolve. A performance takes about five minutes.\n\n==Libretto==\nThe verse to which the aria was set was written by the opera's [[libretto|librettist]] [[Emanuel Schikaneder]]. Schikaneder was the [[impresario]] for whom the opera was written as well as the first performer of the role of Papageno.\n\n<poem lang=\"de\" style=\"float:left;\">\nO zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn,\ndu bist unschuldig, weise, fromm\nEin J\u00fcngling so wie du, vermag am besten,\ndies tiefbetr\u00fcbte Mutterherz zu tr\u00f6sten.\n\nZum Leiden bin ich auserkoren,\ndenn meine Tochter fehlet mir.\nDurch sie ging all mein Gl\u00fcck verloren,\nein B\u00f6sewicht, ein B\u00f6sewicht entfloh mit ihr.\nNoch seh' ich ihr Zittern\nmit bangem Ersch\u00fcttern,\nihr \u00e4ngstliches Beben,\nihr sch\u00fcchternes Streben.\nIch mu\u00dfte sie mir rauben sehen.\n\"Ach helft! Ach helft!\" \u2013 war alles was sie sprach\nallein vergebens war ihr Flehen,\ndenn meine Hilfe war zu schwach.\n\nDu, du, du wirst sie zu befreien gehen,\ndu wirst der Tochter Retter sein!\nja! du wirst der Tochter Retter sein.\nUnd werd' ich dich als Sieger sehen,\nso sei sie dann auf ewig dein.</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\">\nOh, don't tremble, my dear son!\nYou are innocent, wise, pious;\nA youth like you is best able\nto console this deeply troubled mother's heart.\n\nI am chosen for suffering\nFor my daughter is gone from me;\nThrough her all my happiness has been lost,\nA villain, a villain fled with her.\nI can still see her trembling\nwith fearful shaking,\nher frightened quaking,\nher timid effort.\nI had to see her stolen from me.\n\"Oh help! Oh help!\" \u2013 was all that she said\nBut in vain was her pleading,\nFor my powers of help were too weak.\n\nYou, you, you will go to free her,\nYou will be my daughter's savior.\nYes, you will be the rescuer of my daughter.\nAnd if I see you return in triumph,\nLet her then be yours forever.</poem>{{Clear|left}}\n\nThere are five [[quatrain]]s, of which the third is written in [[amphibrach]]ic [[dimeter]] and the remaining ones in [[iambic tetrameter]], which is the normal meter for ''The Magic Flute''. Mozart repeats the words \"ach helft!\" (\"Oh, help!\") and \"Du\" (\"you\", three times), so the lines with these words are not iambic tetrameters as they are actually sung. The rhyme scheme is [AABB][CDCD][EEFF][GHGH][IJIJ].\n\n==Music==\nThe soprano soloist (vocal range: D4 to F6) performs with an orchestra consisting of pairs of [[oboe]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[French horn|horns]], and [[string section|strings]]. The three parts of the Queen's discourse are set as musically separate items, each marked by a change in key:\n\n# Recitative (B-flat major) \u2013 continues the ''Allegro maestoso'' tempo marking of the entrance music, but often performed in free tempo\n# First part of the aria ([[G minor]]) \u2013 ''Andante''\n# Second part of the aria (back to B-flat major) \u2013 ''Allegro moderato''\n\nIt is in the third part that the music reaches a high level of virtuosity for the soloist, including the following very difficult coloratura:\n\n[[File:QueenOfTheNightColoraturaInOZittreNicht.PNG|center|500px]]\n\nIt can be seen that Mozart aligned the text (''dann'') to give the singer the most sonorous and singable vowel \"a\" for most of the passage.\n\nThe highest note, [[F (musical note)|F<sub>6</sub>]] in [[scientific pitch notation]], is claimed by a posthumous witness to have been mentioned by Mozart on his deathbed; the composer was (if the story is true) imagining his sister-in-law's performance. See [[Death of Mozart]].\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=W. A. Mozart - Die Zauberfl\u00f6te - 05.

It is not intended as a display of a singer's vocal prowess but of the Queen's character and as [in] ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung]]'' ... coloratura is often synonymous in Mozart's mind with resolution and anger.<ref>Hughes, Spike (1972) ''Famous Mozart operas''.

A performance takes about five minutes.\n\n==Libretto==\nThe verse to which the aria was set was written by the opera's [[libretto|librettist]] [[Emanuel Schikaneder]]. Schikaneder was the [[impresario]] for whom the opera was written as well as the first performer of the role of Papageno.\n\n<poem lang=\"de\" style=\"float:left;\">\nO zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn,\ndu bist unschuldig, weise, fromm\nEin J\u00fcngling so wie du, vermag am besten,\ndies tiefbetr\u00fcbte Mutterherz zu tr\u00f6sten.\n\nZum Leiden bin ich auserkoren,\ndenn meine Tochter fehlet mir.\nDurch sie ging all mein Gl\u00fcck verloren,\nein B\u00f6sewicht, ein B\u00f6sewicht entfloh mit ihr.\nNoch seh' ich ihr Zittern\nmit bangem Ersch\u00fcttern,\nihr \u00e4ngstliches Beben,\nihr sch\u00fcchternes Streben.\nIch mu\u00dfte sie mir rauben sehen.\n\"Ach helft! Ach helft!\" \u2013 war alles was sie sprach\nallein vergebens war ihr Flehen,\ndenn meine Hilfe war zu schwach.\n\nDu, du, du wirst sie zu befreien gehen,\ndu wirst der Tochter Retter sein!\nja! du wirst der Tochter Retter sein.\nUnd werd' ich dich als Sieger sehen,\nso sei sie dann auf ewig dein.</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\">\nOh, don't tremble, my dear son!\nYou are innocent, wise, pious;\nA youth like you is best able\nto console this deeply troubled mother's heart.\n\nI am chosen for suffering\nFor my daughter is gone from me;\nThrough her all my happiness has been lost,\nA villain, a villain fled with her.\nI can still see her trembling\nwith fearful shaking,\nher frightened quaking,\nher timid effort.\nI had to see her stolen from me.\n\"Oh help!

Mozart repeats the words \"ach helft!\" (\"Oh, help!\") and \"Du\" (\"you\", three times), so the lines with these words are not iambic tetrameters as they are actually sung. The rhyme scheme is [AABB][CDCD][EEFF][GHGH][IJIJ].\n\n==Music==\nThe soprano soloist (vocal range: D4 to F6) performs with an orchestra consisting of pairs of [[oboe]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[French horn|horns]], and [[string section|strings]]. The three parts of the Queen's discourse are set as musically separate items, each marked by a change in key:\n\n# Recitative (B-flat major) \u2013 continues the ''Allegro maestoso'' tempo marking of the entrance music, but often performed in free tempo\n# First part of the aria ([[G minor]]) \u2013 ''Andante''\n# Second part of the aria (back to B-flat major) \u2013 ''Allegro moderato''\n\nIt is in the third part that the music reaches a high level of virtuosity for the soloist, including the following very difficult coloratura:\n\n[[File:QueenOfTheNightColoraturaInOZittreNicht.PNG|center|500px]]\n\nIt can be seen that Mozart aligned the text (''dann'') to give the singer the most sonorous and singable vowel \"a\" for most of the passage.\n\nThe highest note, [[F (musical note)|F<sub>6</sub>]] in [[scientific pitch notation]], is claimed by a posthumous witness to have been mentioned by Mozart on his deathbed; the composer was (if the story is true) imagining his sister-in-law's performance. See [[Death of Mozart]].\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=W. A. Mozart - Die Zauberfl\u00f6te - 05.

It is not intended as a display of a singer's vocal prowess but of the Queen's character and as [in] ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung]]'' ... coloratura is often synonymous in Mozart's mind with resolution and anger.<ref>Hughes, Spike (1972) ''Famous Mozart operas''.

The tour was announced in October 2010 and included dates in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, the Caribbean and South America. In February 2011, Mars and [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] announced joint, co-headlining concerts in North America called \"Hooligans in Wondaland\"; it was Mars' second tour leg in North America. \n\nThe setlist featured most of the songs from ''Doo-Wops & Hooligans'', and covers of [[Barrett Strong]]'s \"[[Money (That's What I Want)]]\" (1959), [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" (1983) and [[The White Stripes]]' \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\" (2003). Mars also performed his featured singles \"[[Nothin' on You]]\" (2009) and \"[[Billionaire (song)|Billionaire]]\" (2010). Mars performed \"[[Grenade (song)|Grenade]]\" (2010) or \"[[Lighters (song)|Lighters]]\" (2011) interpolated with \"[[Talking to the Moon]]\" (2011) as the show's encore.\n\nThe Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour received a generally positive-to-mixed reception from music critics. They praised Mars' energy in his performances and his ability on the drums and guitar solos, as well as his showmanship. Others criticized the various covers he performed. The tour was nominated for a ''[[Pollstar]]'' award.\n\n==Background and development==\nOn September 9, 2010, it was announced that Mars would promote his debut album ''[[Doo-Wops & Hooligans]]'' (2010) as the opening act for [[Maroon 5]] and [[One Republic]] on the fall leg of the [[Hands All Over Tour]] (2010\u201311) in North America. He later joined [[Travis McCoy]] to co-headline a European tour. On the same day, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour to support Mars' album was announced and the first North American tour dates were disclosed.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/bruno-mars-hits-1-on-itunes-with-just-the-way-you-are-sets-first-ever-us-headline-tour-nyse-via.b-1316461.htm|title=Bruno Mars Hits #1 on iTunes With \"Just The Way You Are\"; Sets First-Ever U.S. Headline Tour; Live Performance at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, September 12th; Video Hits MTV & VH1 Networks This Week, With Mars Named VH1's \"You Oughta Know\" Artist; MySpace Music Album Debut Set for September 24th; \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans,\" Arrives October 5th|date=September 9, 2010|publisher=[[Marketwire]]|accessdate=September 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803005203/http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/bruno-mars-hits-1-on-itunes-with-just-the-way-you-are-sets-first-ever-us-headline-tour-nyse-via.b-1316461.htm|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Dates were announced for Europe and Oceania in January 2011.<ref name=\"SCD&HTE\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bruno-mars-tours-australia-for-the-first-time-20110120-19xcr.html|title=Bruno Mars tours Australia for the first time|last=Pepper|first=Daile|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=May 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509075857/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bruno-mars-tours-australia-for-the-first-time-20110120-19xcr.html|archive-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On November 11, 2010, tickets for additional dates added to the North America leg of the tour went on sale and Paradigm was later announced as the tour's producer.<ref name=\"BMIOTM\"/><ref name=Tour>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/5687294/wmes-john-marx-on-bruno-mars-super-bowl-gig-sold-out-arena-tour-strategy|title=WME's John Marx on Bruno Mars' Super Bowl Gig, Sold-Out Arena Tour Strategy, Not Having Presales (Q&A)|last=Peters|first=Mitchell|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912234529/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/5687294/wmes-john-marx-on-bruno-mars-super-bowl-gig-sold-out-arena-tour-strategy|archive-date=September 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The 2010 setlist included seven songs from ''Doo-Wops & Hooligans'', an unreleased track and three covers.<ref name=\"TPTNE\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Mars rejected several requests to open shows for other artists and instead decided to co-headline a tour with [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] called \"Hooligans in Wondaland\", which was produced by [[AEG]].<ref name=\"MAGOM\"/> The announcement of the tour coincided with their performances at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name=\"JLUpdate\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/473034/update-bruno-mars-and-janelle-monae-announce-joint-tour-dates|title=Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae Announce Joint Tour|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|work=Billboard|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328203829/http://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/473034/update-bruno-mars-and-janelle-monae-announce-joint-tour-dates|archive-date=March 28, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This strategy meant lower earnings in the short term but allowed Mars to build a fan base by performing shows at smaller, more intimate venues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/01/06/from-cereal-to-super-bowl-the-evolution-of-bruno-mars/|title=From Cereal To Super Bowl: The Evolution of Bruno Mars|last=Greenburg|first=Zack O'Malley|work=[[Forbes]]|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=March 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209080747/http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/01/06/from-cereal-to-super-bowl-the-evolution-of-bruno-mars/|archive-date=February 9, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nDuring the Hooligans in Wondaland tour, Mars' and Mon\u00e1e's engineers shared the consoles, with technician Ben Rothstein handling the sound gear. In addition, Derek Brener, Mars' [[front of house]] (FOH) engineer controlled several inputs and outputs, including the Stereo Auxiliar Output for [[Subwoofers]]. Brener also controlled the distressors on Mars' vocals and bass. Hall Verb was employed for drums and horns, delay and R-Verb for vocals, and compression of guitar's sound. Mars had two pairs of [[Stage monitor system|speaker wedges]] downstage center. The inner pair was mixed with Mars' voice and a couple of background vocals, while the outer pair had the band mix along with his guitar on top, according to Mars' monitor engineer, Mike Graham. Alex McCloud, Moane's monitor engineer, affirmed the setup was very close to that used by Mars, with Mon\u00e1e having a wedge mix and sidefill speakers in front. Reggie Griffith, Mon\u00e1e's FOH assistant, was in charge of the singer's vocals, removing some of the pitch when she leaned into the microphone.  Griffith and Nate \"Rocket\" Wonder were responsible for mixing Mon\u00e1e's tracks.<ref name=\"BMJMFH\"/>\n\n==Concert synopsis==\n[[File:Bruno Mars Doowops.jpg|thumb|left|Mars performing in Houston, Texas.]]\n\nAmerican rapper [[Donnis]] opened for the first leg of the North American tour.<ref name=\"Donnis\"/> [[Alex Hepburn]] appeared at some of the European shows, while hip-hop duo [[Diafrix]] supported Mars in Australia.<ref name=\"AHNET\"/><ref name=\"Diafrix\"/> A second leg in North America, called \"Hooligans in Wondaland\", was announced; supporting acts included [[Mayer Hawthorne]] & The County, [[Patrick Stump]] and [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]].<ref name=\"HooligansinWondaland\"/> The band consisted of [[Philip Lawrence (songwriter)|Phillip Lawrence]] (backup vocals), Phredley Brown (keyboard), [[Jamareo Artis]] (bass), Eric Hernandez (drums), Kameron Whalum, Dwayne Dugger and James King (horns), Kenji Chan (guitar) and Mars.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|Mars' band references can be seen in the Personnel section under Band}}<ref name=\"GWHF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/65968/bruno-mars-brings-doo-wops-&-hooligans-to-london-on-uk-tour|title=Bruno Mars Brings 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans' To London on UK Tour|last=Frith|first=Holly|work=[[Gigwise]]|date=August 17, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424215600/http://www.gigwise.com/news/65968/bruno-mars-brings-doo-wops-%26-hooligans-to-london-on-uk-tour|archivedate=April 24, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During the tour, Bruno Mars usually wore a [[fedora]] with a \"plaid flannel-turned-vest\" or a sleeveless denim jacket on top of a teeshirt\u2014sometimes with a [[Harley-Davidson]] design\u2014and black jeans.<ref name=\"THRLS\"/><ref name=\"MHJL\"/><ref name=\"OVRH\"/> Mars wore a black suit and tie at some shows in the United Kingdom.

However, the reviewer said the set had too many covers.<ref name=\"NZNZ\"/> Neil McCormick of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' praised Mars' showmanship and called him versatile in his musicality like Prince. McCormick found the mashup of \"Billie Jean\" and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" \"comical\" and was impressed by it. He criticized \"Grenade\" for its lyrical content, calling it \"whiny\".<ref name=\"TTNM\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Gareth Grundy also complemented Mars' stage presence, comparing him to Michael Jackson and Prince.

album ''[[Doo-Wops & Hooligans]]'' (2010). The tour was announced in October 2010 and included dates in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, the Caribbean and South America. In February 2011, Mars and [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] announced a joint, co-headlining concerts in North America called \"Hooligans in Wondaland\"; it was Mars' second tour leg in North America. \n\nThe setlist featured most of the songs from ''Doo-Wops & Hooligans'', and covers of [[Barrett Strong]]'s \"[[Money (That's What I Want)]]\" (1959), [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" (1983) and [[The White Stripes]]' \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\" (2003). Mars also performed his featured singles \"[[Nothin' on You]]\" (2009) and \"[[Billionaire (song)|Billionaire]]\" (2010). Mars performed \"[[Grenade (song)|Grenade]]\" (2010) or \"[[Lighters (song)|Lighters]]\" (2011) interpolated with \"[[Talking to the Moon]]\" (2011) as the show's encore.\n\nThe Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour received a generally positive-to-mixed reception from music critics. They praised Mars' energy in his performances and his ability on the drums and guitar solos, as well as his showmanship. Others criticized the various covers he performed. The tour was nominated for a ''[[Pollstar]]'' award.\n\n==Background and development==\nOn September 9, 2010, it was announced that Mars would promote his debut album ''[[Doo-Wops & Hooligans]]'' (2010) as the opening act for [[Maroon 5]] and [[One Republic]] on the fall leg of the [[Hands All Over Tour]] (2010\u201311) in North America. He later joined [[Travis McCoy]] to co-headline a European tour. On the same day, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour to support Mars' album was announced and the first North American tour dates were disclosed.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/bruno-mars-hits-1-on-itunes-with-just-the-way-you-are-sets-first-ever-us-headline-tour-nyse-via.b-1316461.htm|title=Bruno Mars Hits #1 on iTunes With \"Just The Way You Are\"; Sets First-Ever U.S. Headline Tour; Live Performance at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, September 12th; Video Hits MTV & VH1 Networks This Week, With Mars Named VH1's \"You Oughta Know\" Artist; MySpace Music Album Debut Set for September 24th; \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans,\" Arrives October 5th|date=September 9, 2010|publisher=[[Marketwire]]|accessdate=September 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803005203/http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/bruno-mars-hits-1-on-itunes-with-just-the-way-you-are-sets-first-ever-us-headline-tour-nyse-via.b-1316461.htm|archive-date=August 3, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Dates were announced for Europe and Oceania in January 2011.<ref name=\"SCD&HTE\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bruno-mars-tours-australia-for-the-first-time-20110120-19xcr.html|title=Bruno Mars tours Australia for the first time|last=Pepper|first=Daile|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=May 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509075857/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bruno-mars-tours-australia-for-the-first-time-20110120-19xcr.html|archive-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On November 11, 2010, tickets for additional dates added to the North America leg of the tour went on sale and Paradigm was later announced as the tour's producer.<ref name=\"BMIOTM\"/><ref name=Tour>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/5687294/wmes-john-marx-on-bruno-mars-super-bowl-gig-sold-out-arena-tour-strategy|title=WME's John Marx on Bruno Mars' Super Bowl Gig, Sold-Out Arena Tour Strategy, Not Having Presales (Q&A)|last=Peters|first=Mitchell|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912234529/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/5687294/wmes-john-marx-on-bruno-mars-super-bowl-gig-sold-out-arena-tour-strategy|archive-date=September 12, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The 2010 setlist included seven songs from ''Doo-Wops & Hooligans'', an unreleased track and three covers.<ref name=\"TPTNE\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Mars rejected several requests to open shows for other artists and instead decided to co-headline a tour with [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] called \"Hooligans in Wondaland\", which was produced by [[AEG]].<ref name=\"MAGOM\"/> The announcement of the tour coincided with their performances at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref name=\"JLUpdate\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/473034/update-bruno-mars-and-janelle-monae-announce-joint-tour-dates|title=Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae Announce Joint Tour|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|work=Billboard|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328203829/http://www.billboard.com/articles/photos/live/473034/update-bruno-mars-and-janelle-monae-announce-joint-tour-dates|archive-date=March 28, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This strategy meant lower earnings in the short term but allowed Mars to build a fan base by performing shows at smaller, more intimate venues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/01/06/from-cereal-to-super-bowl-the-evolution-of-bruno-mars/|title=From Cereal To Super Bowl: The Evolution of Bruno Mars|last=Greenburg|first=Zack O'Malley|work=[[Forbes]]|date=January 6, 2014|accessdate=March 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209080747/http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/01/06/from-cereal-to-super-bowl-the-evolution-of-bruno-mars/|archive-date=February 9, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nDuring the Hooligans in Wondaland tour, Mars' and Mon\u00e1e's engineers shared the consoles, with technician Ben Rothstein handling the sound gear. In addition, Derek Brener, Mars' [[front of house]] (FOH) engineer controlled several inputs and outputs, including the Stereo Auxiliar Output for [[Subwoofers]]. Brener also controlled the distressors on Mars' vocals and bass. Hall Verb was employed for drums and horns, delay and R-Verb for vocals, and compression of guitar's sound. Mars had two pairs of [[Stage monitor system|speaker wedges]] downstage center. The inner pair was mixed with Mars' voice and a couple of background vocals, while the outer pair had the band mix along with his guitar on top, according to Mars' monitor engineer, Mike Graham. Alex McCloud, Moane's monitor engineer, affirmed the setup was very close to that used by Mars, with Mon\u00e1e having a wedge mix and sidefill speakers in front. Reggie Griffith, Mon\u00e1e's FOH assistant, was in charge of the singer's vocals, removing some of the pitch when she leaned into the microphone.
