Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 3,400 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind five companies, around 80 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and approximately 200 local mounted irregulars. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John.

These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to be the overall commander of the British forces, and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n===British perspective===\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311.

''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979.

He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval.

Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 3,400 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind five companies, around 80 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and approximately 200 local mounted irregulars. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311. Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979. Details and diagrams of squares used by British</ref>\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{more citations needed|date = January 2013}}\nChelmsford realised that he would need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last= Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.
