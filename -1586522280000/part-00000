[[Kyide Nyimagon]], Langdarma's great grandson, fled to West Tibet {{circa|900 AD}}, and founded a new West Tibetan kingdom at the heart of the old Zhangzhung, now called [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]] in the Tibetan language.\n\nNyimagon's eldest son, [[Lhachen Palgyigon]], is believed to have conquered the regions to the north, including Ladakh and [[Rutog County|Rutog]]. After the death of Nyimagon, his kingdom was divided among his three sons, Palgyigon receiving Ladakh, Rutog, [[Thok Jalung]] and an area referred to as \"Demchok\" (possibly centred around the present day [[Demchok]]). The second son received [[Guge-Purang Kingdom|Guge\u2013Purang]] (called \"Ngari Korsum\") and the third son received [[Zanskar]] and [[Spiti]] (to the southwest of Ladakh). This three-way division of Nyimagon's empire was recognised as historic and remembered in the chronicles of all the three regions as a founding narrative.\n<blockquote>He gave to each of his sons a separate kingdom, viz., to the eldest ''Dpal-gyi-gon'', ''Maryul'' of ''Mngah-ris'', the inhabitants using black bows; ''ru-thogs'' [Rutog] of the east and the Gold-mine of ''Hgog'' [possibly Thok Jalung]; nearer this way ''Lde-mchog-dkar-po'' [Demchok Karpo]; ...</blockquote>\n\nThe first West Tibetan dynasty of [[Maryul]] founded by Palgyigon lasted five centuries, being weakened towards its end by the conquests of the Mongol/Mughal noble [[Mirza Haidar Dughlat]]. Throughout this period the region was called \"Maryul\", possibly from the original proper name ''*Mrasa'' (Xuangzhang's, ''Mo-lo-so''), but in the Tibetan language it was interpreted to mean \"lowland\" (the lowland of Ngari).

Extensive operations were launched in high altitudes by the Indian Army with considerable artillery and air force support. Pakistani troops were evicted from the Indian side of the [[Line of Control]] which the Indian government ordered was to be respected and which was not crossed by Indian troops.

The historic but imprecise divide between Ladakh and the Tibetan Plateau commences in the north in the intricate maze of ridges east of [[Rudok]] including Aling Kangri and Mavang Kangri, and continues southeastward toward northwestern [[Nepal]]. Before partition, [[Baltistan]], now under Pakistani control, was a district in Ladakh. [[Skardu|Skardo]] was the winter capital of Ladakh while Leh was the summer capital.\n\nThe mountain ranges in this region were formed over 45 million years by the folding of the [[Indian Plate]] into the more stationary [[Eurasian Plate]].

[[Rangdum]] is the highest inhabited region in the Suru valley, after which the valley rises to {{convert|4400|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[Pensi-la]], the gateway to Zanskar. Kargil, the only town in the Suru valley, is the second most important town in Ladakh. It was an important staging post on the routes of the trade [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] before 1947, being more or less equidistant, at about 230 kilometres from [[Srinagar]], [[Leh]], [[Skardu]] and [[Padum]]. The Zangskar valley lies in the troughs of the Stod and the Lungnak rivers. The region experiences heavy snowfall; the Pensi-la is open only between June and mid-October. [[Dras]] and the [[Mushkoh Valley]] form the western extremity of Ladakh.\n\nThe Indus River is the backbone of Ladakh. Most major historical and current towns&nbsp;\u2013 [[Shey]], [[Leh]], [[Basgo]] and [[Tingmosgang]] (but not Kargil), are close to the Indus River. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the stretch of the Indus flowing through Ladakh became the only part of this river, which is greatly venerated in the Hindu religion and culture, that still flows through India.\n\nThe [[Siachen Glacier]] is in the eastern Karakoram Range in the Himalaya Mountains along the disputed India-Pakistan border. The Karakoram Range forms a great watershed that separates China from the Indian subcontinent and is sometimes called the \"Third Pole.\"  The glacier lies between the Saltoro Ridge immediately to the west and the main Karakoram Range to the east. At 76&nbsp;km long, it is the longest glacier in the Karakoram and second-longest in the world's non-polar areas. It falls from an altitude of {{convert|5753|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level at its source at [[Indira Col]] on the China border down to {{convert|3620|m|ft|abbr=on}} at its snout.

The [[Pangong range]] runs parallel to the Ladakh Range for about 100&nbsp;km northwest from [[Chushul]] along the southern shore of the [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Lake]]. Its highest point is about {{convert|6700|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the northern slopes are heavily glaciated. The region comprising the valley of the Shayok and Nubra rivers is known as Nubra. The Karakoram Range in Ladakh is not as mighty as in Baltistan. The massifs to the north and east of the Nubra\u2013Siachen line include the [[Apsarasas Kangri|Apsarasas Group]] (highest point {{convert|7245|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}) the [[Rimo Muztagh]] (highest point {{convert|7385|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}) and the [[Teram Kangri|Teram Kangri Group]] (highest point {{convert|7464|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}) together with [[Mamostong Kangri]] ({{convert|7526|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}) and [[Singhi Kangri]] ({{convert|7202|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|; }}). North of the Karakoram lies the Kunlun. Thus, between Leh and eastern Central Asia there is a triple barrier&nbsp;\u2013 the Ladakh Range, Karakoram Range, and Kunlun. Nevertheless, a major trade route was established between Leh and [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]].\n\nLadakh is a high altitude desert as the Himalayas create a [[rain shadow]], generally denying entry to monsoon clouds. The main source of water is the winter snowfall on the mountains. Recent flooding in the region (e.g., the [[2010 Leh floods|2010 floods]]) has been attributed to abnormal rain patterns and retreating glaciers, both of which have been found to be linked to global climate change.<ref>{{cite book |title=As Climate Changes: International Impacts and Implications |last=Strzepek |first=Kenneth M. |author2=Joel B.

This order met with great resistance from the local people who feared that the children would be forced to convert to Christianity. The school taught Tibetan, Urdu, English, Geography, Sciences, Nature study, Arithmetic, Geometry and Bible study.<ref name =Ray/> It is still in existence today. The first local school to provide western education was opened by a local Society called \"Lamdon Social Welfare Society\" in 1973. Later, with support from [[Dalai Lama]] and some international organisations, the school, now known as Lamdon Model Senior Secondary School, has grown to accommodate approximately two thousand pupils in several branches.

[[Kyide Nyimagon]], Langdarma's great grandson, fled to West Tibet {{circa|900 AD}}, and founded a new West Tibetan kingdom at the heart of the old Zhangzhung, now called [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]] in the Tibetan language.\n\nNyimagon's eldest son, [[Lhachen Palgyigon]], is believed to have conquered the regions to the north, including Ladakh and [[Rutog County|Rutog]]. After the death of Nyimagon, his kingdom was divided among his three sons, Palgyigon receiving Ladakh, Rutog, [[Thok Jalung]] and an area referred to as \"Demchok\" (possibly centred around the present day [[Demchok]]). The second son received [[Guge-Purang Kingdom|Guge\u2013Purang]] (called \"Ngari Korsum\") and the third son received [[Zanskar]] and [[Spiti]] (to the southwest of Ladakh). This three-way division of Nyimagon's empire was recognised as historic and remembered in the chronicles of all the three regions as a founding narrative.\n<blockquote>He gave to each of his sons a separate kingdom, viz., to the eldest ''Dpal-gyi-gon'', ''Maryul'' of ''Mngah-ris'', the inhabitants using black bows; ''ru-thogs'' [Rutog] of the east and the Gold-mine of ''Hgog'' [possibly Thok Jalung]; nearer this way ''Lde-mchog-dkar-po'' [Demchok Karpo]; ...</blockquote>\n\nThe first West Tibetan dynasty of [[Maryul]] founded by Palgyigon lasted five centuries, being weakened towards its end by the conquests of the Mongol/Mughal noble [[Mirza Haidar Dughlat]]. Throughout this period the region was called \"Maryul\", possibly from the original proper name ''*Mrasa'' (Xuangzhang's, ''Mo-lo-so''), but in the Tibetan language it was interpreted to mean \"lowland\" (the lowland of Ngari). Maryul remained staunchly Buddhist during this period, having participated in the second diffusion of Buddhism from India to Tibet via Kashmir and Zanskar. \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:The 9 Stupas.jpg|The nine stupas at [[Thiksey Monastery]]\nFile:Likir Buddha.jpg|Statue of [[Maitreya]] at [[Likir Monastery]], [[Leh district]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n[[File:Leh Palace and Jama Masjid minarets.jpg|thumb|right|Jama Masjid of Leh next to the Leh Palace]]\n\nFaced with the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]] in the 13th century, Ladakh chose to seek and accept guidance in religious matters from Tibet. For nearly two centuries till about 1600, Ladakh was subject to raids and invasions from neighbouring Muslim states.

Legends show that the Balti army obsessed with success advanced as far as [[Burang County|Purang]], in the valley of Mansarwar Lake, and won the admiration of their enemies and friends. The Raja of Ladakh sued for peace and, since Ali Sher Khan's intention was not to annexe Ladakh, he agreed subject to the condition that the village of Ganokh and Gagra Nullah should be ceded to [[Skardu]] and he (the Ladakhi Raja) should pay annual tribute.

Brokpas had the highest TBR at 27.17 and Arghuns had the lowest at 14.25. TFR was 2.69 with 1.3 in Leh and 3.4 in Kargil. For Buddhists it was 2.79 and for Muslims it was 2.66. Baltis had a TFR of 3.12 and Arghuns had a TFR of 1.66. The total death rate was 15.69, with Muslims having 16.37 and Buddhists having 14.32.

Edible without cooking, ''tsampa'' makes useful trekking food. A dish that is strictly Ladakhi is ''skyu'', a heavy pasta dish with root vegetables.

These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals.  ''Yang'' chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Religious mask dances are an important part of Ladakh's cultural life. [[Hemis monastery]], a leading centre of the [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa]] tradition of Buddhism, holds an annual masked dance festival, as do all major Ladakhi monasteries.

However, a dissenting group claims this is an [[urban legend]], and that Jourgensen did record new vocals for the EP\u2014albeit in a similar style to Reznor's initial performance. Statements made by both Reznor and Jourgensen seem to confirm the latter view. In a 1992 [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] post regarding \"Supernaut\", Reznor said, <blockquote>[I] finally told Al to redo it without me. The version that Wax Trax put out is Al, the version on the NIN [bootleg] single is me.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Trent Reznor's Posts on Prodigy\n  | publisher = The Nine Inch Nails Article Archive\n  | url = http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=327\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071113143803/http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=327| archivedate= 13 November 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref></blockquote> Reznor referred to the two-track ''Suck'' [[bootleg recording|bootleg]], which contained the recording of \"Supernaut\" that later appeared on ''Black Box''. Jourgensen made a similar statement in a 2003 interview. When asked whose vocals appear on \"Supernaut,\" Jourgensen replied, referring to the WaxTrax! EP, ''Black Box'', and ''[[Greatest Fits]]'' versions, respectively (and corroborating that only the \"Trent Reznor Vocal Version\" contained Reznor's performance, and that Jourgensen in fact sang on most versions of the song): <blockquote>That would be me on the original, on WaxTrax!
