It is a remote, elongated, triangular [[coral]] [[atoll]] with profuse vegetation and a large central marine [[lagoon]]. Nikumaroro is about {{convert|7.5|km|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2.5|km|abbr=on}} wide. The rim has two narrow entrances, both of which are blocked by a wide [[reef]], which is dry at low tide. The ocean beyond the reef is very deep, and the only anchorage is at the island's west end, across the reef from the ruins of a mid-20th-century British colonial village, but this is safe only with the southeast [[trade wind]]s. Landing has always been difficult and is most often done south of the anchorage. Although occupied at various times during the past, the island is uninhabited today.\n\nKiribati declared the [[Phoenix Islands Protected Area]] in 2006, with the park being expanded in 2008.

The first record of a European sighting was made by Capt. C. Kemiss (or Kemin, Kemish) from the [[History of whaling#Britain|British whaling ship]] ''Eliza Ann'' in 1824. On 19 August 1840, the [[USS Vincennes (1826)|USS ''Vincennes'']] of the [[U.S. Exploring Expedition]] confirmed its position and recorded the atoll's name as Gardner Island, originally given in 1825 by [[Coffin (whaling family)#Joshua Coffin|Joshua Coffin]] of the [[Nantucket]] whaler ''[[Ganges (1809 whaler)|Ganges]]''.

The first record of a European sighting was made by Capt. C. Kemiss (or Kemin, Kemish) from the [[History of whaling#Britain|British whaling ship]] ''Eliza Ann'' in 1824. On 19 August 1840, the [[USS Vincennes (1826)|USS ''Vincennes'']] of the [[U.S. Exploring Expedition]] confirmed its position and recorded the atoll's name as Gardner Island, originally given in 1825 by [[Coffin (whaling family)#Joshua Coffin|Joshua Coffin]] of the [[Nantucket]] whaler ''[[Ganges (1809 whaler)|Ganges]]''.

[[Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged'' (1961)]] defines it as \"characterized chiefly by opposition to elements held to be subversive and by the use of tactics involving personal attacks on individuals by means of widely publicized indiscriminate allegations especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges\".</ref><ref>Onion, Rebecca, ''[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/that-have-you-no-sense-of-decency-sir-moment-from-the-1954-army-mccarthy-hearings-isnt-quite-what-we-remember.html We're Never Going to Get Our \u201cHave You No Sense of Decency, Sir?\u201d Moment]'', Slate, July 26, 2018</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Grand Chute, Wisconsin]], McCarthy commissioned in to the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1942, where he served as an [[military intelligence|intelligence]] briefing officer for a [[dive bomber]] squadron.

After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate [[Primary election|primary]] nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin.

La Follette|Robert M. La Follette Sr.]]\n\n===Senate campaign===\nIn his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when [[Pearl Harbor]] was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery.

In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in \"recommendation against permanent employment\" for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll.

Throughout the hearings, McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric, but produced no substantial evidence, to support his accusations.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax\", and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves\".

Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term \"McCarthyism\" was coined by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' cartoonist [[Herblock|Herbert Block]]. Block and others used the word as a synonym for [[demagogy|demagoguery]], baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,\" McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled ''McCarthyism: The Fight For America.''\n\nMcCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for [[John Marshall Butler]] in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of \"protecting Communists\" and \"shielding traitors.\" McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign, and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader [[Earl Russell Browder]].<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Oshinsky\n  |first = David M.\n  |title = A Conspiracy So Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year=  2005\n  |page = 175\n  |isbn = 0-19-515424-X\n  |origyear= 1983}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The Official United States Congressional Daily Digest Records\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |pages = 8', 79th Congress, 3rd Session, Date August 2, 1946, Congressional Records&nbsp;\u2013 House, p. 10749\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1946}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The United States Constitution\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |page = 10\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1782}}\n</ref>\nA Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as \"a despicable, back-street type of campaign,\" as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Cook\n  |first = Fred J.\n  |title = The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Random House\n  |year=  1971\n  |pages = 150\u2013151\n  |isbn = 0-394-46270-X}}</ref> The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite.

Lucas]]. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner.

Marshall had been [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] during World War II and was also Truman's former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the [[Marshall Plan]] for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled ''America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall''. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the [[loss of China]] to Communism.

After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that \"Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal.&nbsp;...

In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing \"1,456 Truman holdovers who were&nbsp;... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.\" He then went on to complain that [[John Paton Davies Jr.]] was still \"on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration,\" even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to \"put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].\" In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War.<ref>All quotes in this paragraph: {{cite book|last = Fried\n |first = Albert\n |year = 1997\n |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |pages = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182 182\u2013184]\n |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182\n }}</ref> By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the \"twenty years of treason\" catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to \"twenty-''one'' years of treason\" to include Eisenhower's first year in office.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fried\n  |first = Albert\n  |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year = 1996\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179 179]\n  |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179\n  }}</ref>\n\nAs McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly.

According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Internal Security Subcommittee]]\u2014the committee normally involved with investigating Communists\u2014thus putting McCarthy \"where he can't do any harm,\" in the words of Senate Majority Leader [[Robert A. Taft]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Fried\n |first = Richard M.\n |year = 1990\n |title = Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |page = 134\n |isbn = 0-19-504361-8\n}}</ref> However, the Committee on Government Operations included the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed [[Roy Cohn]] as chief counsel and 27-year-old [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Cohn brought with him, as his assistant, [[G. David Schine|Gerard David Schine]], heir to a hotel-chain fortune, who would bear much responsibility for triggering McCarthy's eventual downfall.\n\nThis subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003\u201304,<ref>See \"Transcripts, Executive Sessions ...\" under Primary sources, below.</ref> Senators [[Susan Collins]] and [[Carl Levin]] wrote the following in their preface to the documents:\n\n<blockquote>Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.&nbsp;...

Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations.<ref name=\"VOA\">{{cite book\n |last = Heil\n |first = Alan L.\n |year = 2003\n |title = Voice of America: A History\n |publisher = Columbia University Press\n |page = 53\n |isbn = 0-231-12674-3\n}}</ref> A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's \"darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.\"<ref name=\"VOA\" />\n\nThe subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries went as far as [[Book burning|burning]] the newly forbidden books.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

B. Matthews]] as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled \"Reds and Our Churches\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20and%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds and Our Churches\" Matthews \u2013 Google Search|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20in%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds in Our Churches\" Matthews |via=Google Search|publisher=}}</ref> which opened with the sentence, \"The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.\" A group of senators denounced this \"shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy\" and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] laboratory at [[Fort Monmouth]]. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations.<ref>{{cite book|last = Stone|title = Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism|isbn = 0-393-05880-8|url = https://archive.org/details/periloustimesfre00ston|publisher = W.W. Norton & Co.|year = 2004}}</ref> Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of [[Irving Peress]], a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing [[American Labor Party]], had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McCarthy responded by sending a message to [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[Robert T. Stevens]], demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ralph Wise Zwicker|Ralph W. Zwicker]], his commanding officer at [[Camp Kilmer]] in [[New Jersey]], gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy's encouragement, \"Who promoted Peress?\" became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Bart |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Irving Peress, dentist who was subject of Sen.

After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in \"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\", and that Adams \"made vigorous and diligent efforts\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\".<ref>Karl E.

It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men\u2014not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.\n\nThis is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.\n\nThe actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it\u2014and rather successfully.

[[Constitution of Wisconsin|Wisconsin's constitution]] stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from [[organized labor]] or the [[Democratic Party (Wisconsin)|state Democratic Party]], the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nFollowing the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from the [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk County]] district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act.

Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to [[censure in the United States|censure]] McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, \"It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,\" but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a \"bill of particulars\" listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator [[Arthur Vivian Watkins]], was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

HUAC was a House committee, and as such it had no formal connection to McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938\u20131975).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/house-un-american-activities-committee.html |title=House Un-American Activities Committee |publisher=infoplease.com |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\nFrom the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. [[Herblock]]'s cartoon that coined the term ''McCarthyism'' appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].\n\nIn 1951, [[Ray Bradbury]] published ''The Fireman'', an allegory on suppression of ideas.

After a worried [[Rhode Island]] newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator [[Walt Kelly]] began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features.

He was impersonated by nightclub and radio [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and was satirized in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including \"Point of Order\" by [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]], \"Senator McCarthy Blues\" by [[Hal Block]], and unionist folk singer [[Joe Glazer]]'s \"Joe McCarthy's Band\", sung to the tune of \"[[McNamara's Band]]\". Also in 1954, the radio comedy team [[Bob and Ray]] parodied McCarthy with the character \"Commissioner Carstairs\" in their soap opera spoof \"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\". That same year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio network broadcast a satire, ''[[The Investigator]]'', whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = Thomas\n| last = Doherty\n| title= Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture\n| url = https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher= Columbia University Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe/page/213 213]\n| year= 2005\n| isbn= 978-0-231-12953-4}}</ref>\n\nThe 1953 short story ''Mr. Costello, Hero'' by [[Theodore Sturgeon]] was described by noted journalist and author [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]] as \"the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoresturgeontrust.com/williams.html|title=Theodore Sturgeon, Storyteller|last=Williams|first=Paul|date=1976|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Post-censure reaction====\n''Mr. Costello, Hero'' was adapted in 1958 by [[X Minus One]] into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956.<ref>https://archive.org/download/OTRR_X_Minus_One_Singles/XMinusOne56-07-03058MrCostelloHero.mp3</ref> While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably.

[[Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged'' (1961)]] defines it as \"characterized chiefly by opposition to elements held to be subversive and by the use of tactics involving personal attacks on individuals by means of widely publicized indiscriminate allegations especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges\".</ref><ref>Onion, Rebecca, ''[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/that-have-you-no-sense-of-decency-sir-moment-from-the-1954-army-mccarthy-hearings-isnt-quite-what-we-remember.html We're Never Going to Get Our \u201cHave You No Sense of Decency, Sir?\u201d Moment]'', Slate, July 26, 2018</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Grand Chute, Wisconsin]], McCarthy commissioned in to the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1942, where he served as an [[military intelligence|intelligence]] briefing officer for a [[dive bomber]] squadron.

After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate [[Primary election|primary]] nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator [[Robert M. La Follette Jr.]], founder of the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator [[Robert M. La Follette|Robert M. La Follette Sr.]]\n\n===Senate campaign===\nIn his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when [[Pearl Harbor]] was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery. La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Rovere\n  |first = Richard H.\n  |title = Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = University of California Press\n  |year=  1959\n  |pages = 97, 102\n  |isbn = 0-520-20472-7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jack Anderson and Ronald W.

It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war-time nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\", using the slogan, \"Congress needs a tail-gunner\".

In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in \"recommendation against permanent employment\" for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll.

Service]], and [[Philip Jessup]]. Some of them no longer worked for the State Department, or never had; all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy's, who at one point described him as a \"top Russian spy\". Throughout the hearings, McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric, but produced no substantial evidence, to support his accusations.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax\", and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves\". Republicans responded in kind, with [[William E.

Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: \"While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I am certain that if [[Josef Stalin]] or a member of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations ... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business.\"<ref>Hillenkoetter Testimony, 7-14-50, ''CIS Unpublished'' ''U.S. Senate Committee Hearings on Microfiche ''(Washington D.C.: Congressional Information Service); quoted in David M.

Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term \"McCarthyism\" was coined by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' cartoonist [[Herblock|Herbert Block]]. Block and others used the word as a synonym for [[demagogy|demagoguery]], baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,\" McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled ''McCarthyism: The Fight For America.''\n\nMcCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for [[John Marshall Butler]] in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of \"protecting Communists\" and \"shielding traitors.\" McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign, and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader [[Earl Russell Browder]].<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Oshinsky\n  |first = David M.\n  |title = A Conspiracy So Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year=  2005\n  |page = 175\n  |isbn = 0-19-515424-X\n  |origyear= 1983}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The Official United States Congressional Daily Digest Records\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |pages = 8', 79th Congress, 3rd Session, Date August 2, 1946, Congressional Records&nbsp;\u2013 House, p. 10749\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1946}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The United States Constitution\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |page = 10\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1782}}\n</ref>\nA Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as \"a despicable, back-street type of campaign,\" as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Cook\n  |first = Fred J.\n  |title = The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Random House\n  |year=  1971\n  |pages = 150\u2013151\n  |isbn = 0-394-46270-X}}</ref> The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite.

After he lost the election by almost 40,000 votes, Tydings claimed foul play.\n\nIn addition to the Tydings\u2013Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the [[1950 United States Senate elections|1950 elections]], including [[Everett Dirksen]] against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader [[Scott W. Lucas]]. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Cook\n  |first = Fred J.\n  |title = The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Random House\n  |year=  1971\n  |page = 316\n  |isbn = 0-394-46270-X}}</ref>\nIn the 1952 Senate elections McCarthy was returned to his Senate seat with 54.2% of the vote, compared to Democrat Thomas Fairchild's 45.6%.\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n| title=1952 Wisconsin U.S. Senate election}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n  |party      = Republican Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Joseph McCarthy\n  |votes      = 870,444\n  |percentage = 54.2\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n  |party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = [[Thomas E.

Truman|President Truman]] clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats' \"twenty years of treason\". Truman, in turn, once referred to McCarthy as \"the best asset the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] has\", calling McCarthy's actions an attempt to \"sabotage the [[foreign policy of the United States]]\" in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war.<ref>\n{{cite book|last = Herman\n  |first = Arthur\n  |title = Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator\n  |publisher = Free Press\n  |year = 2000\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/josephmccarthyre00herm/page/131 131]\n  |isbn = 0-684-83625-4\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/josephmccarthyre00herm/page/131\n  }}</ref>\nIt was the Truman Administration's State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 (or 57 or 81) \"known Communists\". Truman's [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[George Marshall|George Catlett Marshall]], was the target of some of McCarthy's most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] during World War II and was also Truman's former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the [[Marshall Plan]] for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled ''America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall''. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the [[loss of China]] to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;<ref name=\"Retreat\">\n{{cite book\n  |last = McCarthy\n  |first = Joseph\n  |title = Major Speeches and Debates of Senator Joe McCarthy Delivered in the United States Senate, 1950\u20131951\n  |publisher = Gordon Press\n  |year=  1951\n  |pages = 264, 307, 215\n  |isbn = 0-87968-308-2}}</ref>\ndeclared that \"if Marshall were merely stupid, the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country's interest\";<ref name=\"Retreat\"/> and most famously, accused him of being part of \"a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man\".<ref name=\"Retreat\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], when President Truman dismissed General [[Douglas MacArthur]], McCarthy charged that Truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during late-night sessions when \"they've had time to get the President cheerful\" on bourbon and [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine]].

The Republican party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that \"Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal.&nbsp;...

In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing \"1,456 Truman holdovers who were&nbsp;... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.\" He then went on to complain that [[John Paton Davies Jr.]] was still \"on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration,\" even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to \"put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].\" In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War.<ref>All quotes in this paragraph: {{cite book|last = Fried\n |first = Albert\n |year = 1997\n |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |pages = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182 182\u2013184]\n |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182\n }}</ref> By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the \"twenty years of treason\" catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to \"twenty-''one'' years of treason\" to include Eisenhower's first year in office.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fried\n  |first = Albert\n  |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year = 1996\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179 179]\n  |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179\n  }}</ref>\n\nAs McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly.

According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Internal Security Subcommittee]]\u2014the committee normally involved with investigating Communists\u2014thus putting McCarthy \"where he can't do any harm,\" in the words of Senate Majority Leader [[Robert A. Taft]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Fried\n |first = Richard M.\n |year = 1990\n |title = Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |page = 134\n |isbn = 0-19-504361-8\n}}</ref> However, the Committee on Government Operations included the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed [[Roy Cohn]] as chief counsel and 27-year-old [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Cohn brought with him, as his assistant, [[G. David Schine|Gerard David Schine]], heir to a hotel-chain fortune, who would bear much responsibility for triggering McCarthy's eventual downfall.\n\nThis subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003\u201304,<ref>See \"Transcripts, Executive Sessions ...\" under Primary sources, below.</ref> Senators [[Susan Collins]] and [[Carl Levin]] wrote the following in their preface to the documents:\n\n<blockquote>Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.&nbsp;...

Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations.<ref name=\"VOA\">{{cite book\n |last = Heil\n |first = Alan L.\n |year = 2003\n |title = Voice of America: A History\n |publisher = Columbia University Press\n |page = 53\n |isbn = 0-231-12674-3\n}}</ref> A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's \"darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.\"<ref name=\"VOA\" />\n\nThe subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries went as far as [[Book burning|burning]] the newly forbidden books.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

B. Matthews]] as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled \"Reds and Our Churches\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20and%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds and Our Churches\" Matthews \u2013 Google Search|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20in%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds in Our Churches\" Matthews |via=Google Search|publisher=}}</ref> which opened with the sentence, \"The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.\" A group of senators denounced this \"shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy\" and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] laboratory at [[Fort Monmouth]]. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations.<ref>{{cite book|last = Stone|title = Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism|isbn = 0-393-05880-8|url = https://archive.org/details/periloustimesfre00ston|publisher = W.W. Norton & Co.|year = 2004}}</ref> Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of [[Irving Peress]], a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing [[American Labor Party]], had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McCarthy responded by sending a message to [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[Robert T. Stevens]], demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ralph Wise Zwicker|Ralph W. Zwicker]], his commanding officer at [[Camp Kilmer]] in [[New Jersey]], gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy's encouragement, \"Who promoted Peress?\" became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Bart |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Irving Peress, dentist who was subject of Sen.

After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in \"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\", and that Adams \"made vigorous and diligent efforts\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\".<ref>Karl E.

It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men\u2014not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.\n\nThis is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.\n\nThe actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it\u2014and rather successfully.

[[Constitution of Wisconsin|Wisconsin's constitution]] stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from [[organized labor]] or the [[Democratic Party (Wisconsin)|state Democratic Party]], the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nFollowing the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from the [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk County]] district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act.

Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to [[censure in the United States|censure]] McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, \"It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,\" but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a \"bill of particulars\" listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator [[Arthur Vivian Watkins]], was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

HUAC was a House committee, and as such it had no formal connection to McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938\u20131975).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/house-un-american-activities-committee.html |title=House Un-American Activities Committee |publisher=infoplease.com |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\nFrom the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. [[Herblock]]'s cartoon that coined the term ''McCarthyism'' appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].\n\nIn 1951, [[Ray Bradbury]] published ''The Fireman'', an allegory on suppression of ideas.

After a worried [[Rhode Island]] newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator [[Walt Kelly]] began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features.

He was impersonated by nightclub and radio [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and was satirized in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including \"Point of Order\" by [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]], \"Senator McCarthy Blues\" by [[Hal Block]], and unionist folk singer [[Joe Glazer]]'s \"Joe McCarthy's Band\", sung to the tune of \"[[McNamara's Band]]\". Also in 1954, the radio comedy team [[Bob and Ray]] parodied McCarthy with the character \"Commissioner Carstairs\" in their soap opera spoof \"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\". That same year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio network broadcast a satire, ''[[The Investigator]]'', whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = Thomas\n| last = Doherty\n| title= Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture\n| url = https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher= Columbia University Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe/page/213 213]\n| year= 2005\n| isbn= 978-0-231-12953-4}}</ref>\n\nThe 1953 short story ''Mr. Costello, Hero'' by [[Theodore Sturgeon]] was described by noted journalist and author [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]] as \"the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoresturgeontrust.com/williams.html|title=Theodore Sturgeon, Storyteller|last=Williams|first=Paul|date=1976|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Post-censure reaction====\n''Mr. Costello, Hero'' was adapted in 1958 by [[X Minus One]] into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956.<ref>https://archive.org/download/OTRR_X_Minus_One_Singles/XMinusOne56-07-03058MrCostelloHero.mp3</ref> While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably.

On September 11, 2001, when Clark saw a giant fireball in his [[peripheral vision]], coming from the adjacent [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] at 8:46&nbsp;a.m., he quickly picked up his issued gear and began evacuation procedures for the staff on his floor of the [[Two World Trade Center|South Tower]]. Clark went to his company's [[trading floor]], which stood at the east side of his tower. When he arrived, he saw his co-workers peering out the windows, and heard them describe the sight of people jumping to their deaths from the adjacent tower. One of Clark's co-workers screamed as she witnessed this and turned away, overwhelmed by the horrific sight. She sought comfort in Clark's arms. He took her to the women's restroom so she could regain her composure. Clark would later credit this act with saving his own life, because it took him away from the east side of his building. At 9:03&nbsp;a.m., United Airlines [[Flight 175]] crashed into the south side of his tower, only a few floors below the spot on the trading floor where Clark had been standing only moments before.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Rescue of Stanley Praimnath===\n\nAfter Flight 175 struck the South Tower, Clark and seven other employees of his floor who had survived the impact gathered together and started to descend Stairwell A. They only made it to the 81st floor when Clark and his group were met by a woman and a man coming up the stairs. The woman blocked their paths and warned them there were flames and smoke further down, and their only option was to try and go up to the roof in hope of being rescued from there.\n\nClark and his coworkers stopped and debated on the stairwell landing about what to do next; whether to listen to the woman and go up the stairs or to ignore her warnings and go down the stairs. As the group stood there debating their next move, a faint scream for help coming from inside the 81st floor caught Clark's attention. While his group continued to debate what to do, Clark grabbed coworker Ron DiFrancesco and entered the 81st floor to look for the person screaming for help. As Clark and DiFrancesco entered the floor, Clark turned around to observe his coworkers as they started to go up the stairs to the roof instead of down. That group would all lose their lives that day, as access doors to the roof were locked, and there were no plans for helicopter rescues from the roof, as the [[NYPD]] deemed it too unsafe to attempt due to dense clouds of smoke and rooftop antennas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1003784754436648720|title=Could Helicopters Have Saved People From the Top of the Trade Center?|last=Paltrow|first=Scot J.|date=2001-10-23|last2=Journal|first2=Queena Sook Kim Staff Reporters of The Wall Street|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-14}}</ref>\n\nAs Clark and DiFrancesco made their way to the voice screaming for help, DiFrancesco became overcome with smoke and returned to the stairs, which he would also ascend. Unlike the rest of his coworkers who went up the stairs, however, DiFrancesco reversed course and survived. Clark made his way to find [[Fuji Bank]] employee [[Stanley Praimnath]], who was pinned underneath some debris behind a wall that had stood firm.\n\nPraimnath had initially evacuated the building after the first plane had hit the North Tower but was told to go back inside. Once he had arrived back at his office on the 81st floor, he was on the phone when he noticed the second plane coming right at him. He screamed and jumped under his desk as the plane was hitting the building. After the impact, Praimnath found himself alive under his desk with only minor injuries. When Clark found Praimnath, there was a wall standing between the two, and the only way for Praimnath to escape was to jump up and go over the wall.\n\nPraimnath was unsure he would be able to get over the wall but tried due to Clark's urging. Praimnath made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the wall, on one occasion injuring his hand, but he persisted, and on another attempt Clark was able to hook his arms around Praimnath and help pull him to the other side.<ref name=\"PbsASurvivorsStory\"/><ref>\n{{cite book\n| isbn        = 978-1-902636-66-5\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=das43hsInVIC&pg=PR5&dq=%22Brian+Clark%22+%22september+11%22+OR+WTC+OR+%22World+Trade+Center%22#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Clark&f=false\n| title       = Reality, truth and evil: facts, questions and perspectives on September 11, 2001\n| publisher   = [[Temple Lodge Publishing]]\n| author      = Thomas Meyer, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Morales\n| year        = 2005\n| pages        = 118\u2013119\n| accessdate  = 2011-04-01\n}}  \n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n| isbn        = 978-0-8058-4935-6\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=1c0PXqKlx5UC&pg=PR9&dq=%22Brian+Clark%22+%22september+11%22+OR+WTC+OR+%22World+Trade+Center%22#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Clark&f=false\n| title       = The social psychology of prosocial behavior\n| publisher   = [[Routledge]]\n| author      = John F.

These panels were fractured by the initial impacts and explosions, and their twisting and shaking blocked fire doors and stairwells and then shattered to make much of the dust after the buildings collapsed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe airliner that struck the North Tower struck it perpendicular to the north face. The impact severed all the elevators and all three stairwells.  The airliner that struck the South Tower struck at an angle, severing two stairwells, but it left Stairway A, the one they were using, more or less intact. A few floors below the impact, Clark and Praimnath encountered one of Clark's colleagues, Jos\u00e9 Marrero, ascending and using a [[walkie-talkie]].  Marrero had received a call from another of Clark's colleagues above, David Vera, saying his party needed help.  Clark tried to convince his colleague not to ascend, but Marrero insisted on going higher to help Vera and the others. At the [[Skylobby]] on the 44th floor, Clark and Praimnath encountered a [[Port Authority]] employee who was tending to a severely injured tenant.  The P.A. employee told them that all the phones were out on that floor.  He asked them, when they had access to a working phone, to have someone send an [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] to care for this injured tenant.\n\nThe phones were working in Oppenheimer's offices on the 31st floor.  Clark was on the telephone for over three minutes and talked to three different people before his [[9-1-1|911]] call was understood. This call might have been the only chance for rescue workers to learn that there was a clear stairwell that the several hundred people trapped above the impact could try to use to escape. Clark described how he and Praimnath did not feel a sense of urgency, and before calling 911 they each made one brief personal call.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nytimes.com/2002/05/26/nyregion/accounts-from-the-south-tower.html|title=Accounts From the South Tower|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nAt 9:55 am, they got to the ground floor where there were rescue workers. One advised them to run once they exited onto Liberty Street, at the southeast corner of the complex. At 9:56 am, Clark and Praimnath ran out of the World Trade Center complex. Clark described how, when they had gotten about two blocks away, Praimnath told him he thought the buildings were going to go down. Clark was skeptical, repeating how solidly built the towers were, but he did not finish his sentence before the South Tower (Tower Two) started to collapse. Clark and Praimnath had left the South Tower just four minutes before it collapsed; they were two of the last 25 people to exit the building; Clark was number 22. Only two other people exited the South Tower after Clark and Praimnath.<ref name=\"9/11StoryClark\">{{cite news|title=9/11 stories: Stanley Praimnath and Brian Clark|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-14766882|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=BBC|date=5 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n\nPraimnath thanked Clark for saving his life.<ref name=\"PbsASurvivorsStory\"/> Clark, in turn, also thanked Praimnath since he felt that the act of leaving his group and freeing Praimnath drew him out of a debate that might have ended with his joining the others who went up to their deaths.

On September 11, 2001, when Clark saw a giant fireball in his [[peripheral vision]], coming from the adjacent [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] at 8:46&nbsp;a.m., he quickly picked up his issued gear and began evacuation procedures for the staff on his floor of the [[Two World Trade Center|South Tower]]. Clark went to his company's [[trading floor]], which stood at the east side of his tower. When he arrived, he saw his co-workers peering out the windows, and heard them describe the sight of people jumping to their deaths from the adjacent tower. One of Clark's co-workers screamed as she witnessed this and turned away, overwhelmed by the horrific sight. She sought comfort in Clark's arms. He took her to the women's restroom so she could regain her composure. Clark would later credit this act with saving his own life, because it took him away from the east side of his building. At 9:03&nbsp;a.m., United Airlines [[Flight 175]] crashed into the south side of his tower, only a few floors below the spot on the trading floor where Clark had been standing only moments before.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Rescue of Stanley Praimnath===\n\nAfter Flight 175 struck the South Tower, Clark and seven other employees of his floor who had survived the impact gathered together and started to descend Stairwell A. They only made it to the 81st floor when Clark and his group were met by a woman and a man coming up the stairs. The woman blocked their paths and warned them there were flames and smoke further down, and their only option was to try and go up to the roof in hope of being rescued from there.\n\nClark and his coworkers stopped and debated on the stairwell landing about what to do next; whether to listen to the woman and go up the stairs or to ignore her warnings and go down the stairs. As the group stood there debating their next move, a faint scream for help coming from inside the 81st floor caught Clark's attention. While his group continued to debate what to do, Clark grabbed coworker Ron DiFrancesco and entered the 81st floor to look for the person screaming for help. As Clark and DiFrancesco entered the floor, Clark turned around to observe his coworkers as they started to go up the stairs to the roof instead of down. That group would all lose their lives that day, as access doors to the roof were locked, and there were no plans for helicopter rescues from the roof, as the [[NYPD]] deemed it too unsafe to attempt due to dense clouds of smoke and rooftop antennas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1003784754436648720|title=Could Helicopters Have Saved People From the Top of the Trade Center?|last=Paltrow|first=Scot J.|date=2001-10-23|last2=Journal|first2=Queena Sook Kim Staff Reporters of The Wall Street|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-07-14}}</ref>\n\nAs Clark and DiFrancesco made their way to the voice screaming for help, DiFrancesco became overcome with smoke and returned to the stairs, which he would also ascend. Unlike the rest of his coworkers who went up the stairs, however, DiFrancesco reversed course and survived. Clark made his way to find [[Fuji Bank]] employee [[Stanley Praimnath]], who was pinned underneath some debris behind a wall that had stood firm.\n\nPraimnath had initially evacuated the building after the first plane had hit the North Tower but was told to go back inside. Once he had arrived back at his office on the 81st floor, he was on the phone when he noticed the second plane coming right at him. He screamed and jumped under his desk as the plane was hitting the building. After the impact, Praimnath found himself alive under his desk with only minor injuries. When Clark found Praimnath, there was a wall standing between the two, and the only way for Praimnath to escape was to jump up and go over the wall.\n\nPraimnath was unsure he would be able to get over the wall but tried due to Clark's urging. Praimnath made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the wall, on one occasion injuring his hand, but he persisted, and on another attempt Clark was able to hook his arms around Praimnath and help pull him to the other side.<ref name=\"PbsASurvivorsStory\"/><ref>\n{{cite book\n| isbn        = 978-1-902636-66-5\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=das43hsInVIC&pg=PR5&dq=%22Brian+Clark%22+%22september+11%22+OR+WTC+OR+%22World+Trade+Center%22#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Clark&f=false\n| title       = Reality, truth and evil: facts, questions and perspectives on September 11, 2001\n| publisher   = [[Temple Lodge Publishing]]\n| author      = Thomas Meyer, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Morales\n| year        = 2005\n| pages        = 118\u2013119\n| accessdate  = 2011-04-01\n}}  \n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n| isbn        = 978-0-8058-4935-6\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=1c0PXqKlx5UC&pg=PR9&dq=%22Brian+Clark%22+%22september+11%22+OR+WTC+OR+%22World+Trade+Center%22#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Clark&f=false\n| title       = The social psychology of prosocial behavior\n| publisher   = [[Routledge]]\n| author      = John F.

These panels were fractured by the initial impacts and explosions, and their twisting and shaking blocked fire doors and stairwells and then shattered to make much of the dust after the buildings collapsed.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe airliner that struck the North Tower struck it perpendicular to the north face. The impact severed all the elevators and all three stairwells.  The airliner that struck the South Tower struck at an angle, severing two stairwells, but it left Stairway A, the one they were using, more or less intact. A few floors below the impact, Clark and Praimnath encountered one of Clark's colleagues, Jos\u00e9 Marrero, ascending and using a [[walkie-talkie]].  Marrero had received a call from another of Clark's colleagues above, David Vera, saying his party needed help.  Clark tried to convince his colleague not to ascend, but Marrero insisted on going higher to help Vera and the others. At the [[Skylobby]] on the 44th floor, Clark and Praimnath encountered a [[Port Authority]] employee who was tending to a severely injured tenant.  The P.A. employee told them that all the phones were out on that floor.  He asked them, when they had access to a working phone, to have someone send an [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] to care for this injured tenant.\n\nThe phones were working in Oppenheimer's offices on the 31st floor.  Clark was on the telephone for over three minutes and talked to three different people before his [[9-1-1|911]] call was understood. This call might have been the only chance for rescue workers to learn that there was a clear stairwell that the several hundred people trapped above the impact could try to use to escape. Clark described how he and Praimnath did not feel a sense of urgency, and before calling 911 they each made one brief personal call.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nytimes.com/2002/05/26/nyregion/accounts-from-the-south-tower.html|title=Accounts From the South Tower|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nAt 9:55 am, they got to the ground floor where there were rescue workers. One advised them to run once they exited onto Liberty Street, at the southeast corner of the complex. At 9:56 am, Clark and Praimnath ran out of the World Trade Center complex. Clark described how, when they had gotten about two blocks away, Praimnath told him he thought the buildings were going to go down. Clark was skeptical, repeating how solidly built the towers were, but he did not finish his sentence before the South Tower (Tower Two) started to collapse. Clark and Praimnath had left the South Tower just four minutes before it collapsed; they were two of the last 25 people to exit the building; Clark was number 22. Only two other people exited the South Tower after Clark and Praimnath.<ref name=\"9/11StoryClark\">{{cite news|title=9/11 stories: Stanley Praimnath and Brian Clark|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-14766882|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=BBC|date=5 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n\nPraimnath thanked Clark for saving his life.<ref name=\"PbsASurvivorsStory\"/> Clark, in turn, also thanked Praimnath since he felt that the act of leaving his group and freeing Praimnath drew him out of a debate that might have ended with his joining the others who went up to their deaths.

During the voyage, ''Triton'' crossed the Equator four times while maintaining an average speed of {{convert|18|kn}}.  ''Triton''{{'s}} overall navigational track during Operation Sandblast generally followed that of the first circumnavigation of the world led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] from 1519 to 1522.\n\nThe initial impetus for Operation Sandblast was to increase American technological and scientific prestige before the May [[1960 Paris Summit]] between President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  It also provided a high-profile public demonstration of the capability of U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarines to carry out long-range submerged operations independent of external support and undetected by hostile forces, presaging the initial deployment of the Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[George Washington-class submarine|ballistic missile submarines]] later in 1960.  Finally, Operation Sandblast gathered extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, geophysical, and psychological data during ''Triton''{{'s}} circumnavigation.\n\nOfficial celebrations were cancelled for Operation Sandblast following the diplomatic furor arising from the [[1960 U-2 incident]] in which a U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in early May. However, ''Triton'' did receive the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe in recognition of the successful completion of its mission, and Captain Beach received the [[Legion of Merit]] for his role as ''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer.  In 1961, Beach received the [[Magellanic Premium]] from the [[American Philosophical Society]], the United States' oldest and most prestigious scientific award in \"recognition of his navigation of the U.S. submarine ''Triton'' around the globe.\"\n\n==Mission overview\u2014Project Magellan==\n{{Quotation|There is no doubt that sooner or later the USSR will put some nuclear submarine to sea.

We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If you take a look at a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go.  So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking\u2014that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.<ref name=WellAroundtheWorld>{{cite journal |last= Schultz |first= Fred |authorlink= |date=February 2003 |title= We'll Go Around the World: An Interview with Captain Edward L.

''Triton'' would depart as scheduled on 16 February, and the submarine would arrive back home no later than 10 May 1960.  The mission objectives for Operation Sandblast were summarized below:\n\n<blockquote>For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress \u2013 all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] \u2013 it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.<ref name=FirstB5/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Captain Beach, the Navy came up with the [[code name]] of ''Sandblast'' because it was judged that taking his ship around the world submerged would \"take a lot of sand\" on the crew's part to be successful.  Also, ''Sand'' served as Beach's personal code name during the mission.  As the captain noted:  \"Most beaches are full of sand, I was informed.\"<ref>Beach.

''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 84\u201387.</ref>\n\nCaptain Beach announced the true nature of their shakedown cruise ''(pictured)'':\n\n<blockquote>Men, I know you\u2019ve all been waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we\u2019re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I can tell you that we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We\u2019re going around the world, nonstop. And we\u2019re going to do it entirely submerged.<ref>Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 89\u201392.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegarding the upcoming voyage, Beach adopted a decidedly non-traditional command style:\n\n<blockquote>Early on, I realized that what this particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch.  Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction.  Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications was not a problem \u2014 submariners are used to that \u2014 but bearing down too much on the job might be.  My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us.  It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up.  This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.<ref>Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. p. xii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor the shakedown cruise, Beach adopted a specific weekly shipboard routine.  Mondays and Tuesdays involved regular activities, with drills, lectures, school of the ship, and class programs from the noon to 1600 watch.  Wednesdays had the crew on reduced activities that is traditionally known as Rope Yarn Sunday.  Thursdays saw a schedule of regular drills, and Fridays involved upkeep and general maintenance activities known as Field Day.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p.

Since ''Triton'' did not have a generator to extract oxygen from sea water, these nightly snorkeling activities were crucial to maintaining a suitable atmosphere.\n\nLater that same day, 17 February 1960, ''Triton'' experienced a serious leak with a main condenser circulating water pump, and a reactor warning alarm tripped because of a defective electrical connection. Both incidents were handled successfully and did not affect the ship's performance.<ref>Beach.

It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I had a field day every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object.\"  To remove trash without surfacing, ''Triton'' had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship.  However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.<ref name=WellAroundtheWorld/><ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-10 to B-12.</ref><ref>Beach.

The first was when Chief Radarman (RDC) John R. Poole began suffering from a series of [[kidney stone]]s.  The second was when the ship's fathometer went out of commission, with its loss meaning ''Triton'' could no longer echo-sound the sea floor, increasing the danger of grounding or collision as the ship traveled through poorly charted waters.  Captain Beach observed:\n\n<blockquote>Fortunately at the present time we are in an area where the water is deeper than normal for the Atlantic and for a number of hours there is [no] worry about unexpectedly scraping the top of any unsuspected submerged peak.  But we will want that fathometer badly as we approach Cape Horn.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-22.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPerhaps most critically, the third problem involved the readings on one of the reactors indicating a serious malfunction which required its shutdown.<ref group=Note>\"In late February (1960) in the Atlantic, the USS ''Triton'' (SSN-586), shortly after departure for a submerged global circumnavigation, suffers a leak in a main condenser circulating water pump, necessitating the shutdown of the port reactor for five hours to effect repairs.\" ''Neptune Paper No. 3: Naval Accidents 1945\u20131988'' by William M.

On that day we were to have them in threes.\"<ref>Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 128.</ref>\n\nLater that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his electronics technician team returned the fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and ''Triton''{{'}}s engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, ''Triton'' continued south, although there was a detour to the [[Golfo Nuevo]] region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the [[Argentine Navy]] had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but ''Triton''{{'}}s contact turned out to be a school of fish.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-22 to B-23.</ref><ref name=\"Beach. p. 116-140\">Beach.

She subsequently passed west of the Falklands, and rounded Cape Horn ''(pictured)'' through [[Estrecho de le Maire]] ([[Drake Passage]]) on 7 March.

''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 171\u2013175.</ref> On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's [[Submarine hull#Pressure hull|pressure hull]], it could not be repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, ''Triton'' could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to ''Triton''{{'}}s fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.<ref name=Beach291/>\n\nAn alternative to the fathometer was devised involving the use of the ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the combat intelligence center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the fathometer to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor.<ref name=Beach17579>Beach.

The northeastern coast of the island was photographed for two and a half hours before the statue that [[Thor Heyerdahl]] had erected was spotted. The entire crew was invited to observe through the periscope before ''Triton'' departed for her next visual landfall\u2013[[Guam]], some {{convert|6734|nmi|km mi}} distant.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-33 to B-35.</ref><ref>Beach.

The repair required the complete re-wiring of the compressor's armature, a task ordinarily done aboard a [[submarine tender]] or in a shipyard. Captain Beach was deeply impressed by \"this spirit and outlook [that] permeated our crew.\"  He was also \"astonished\" by two different makeshift fathometer sound transmitters created by the electronics and engineering crewmen. One was based on a general announcing speaker, while the other used a stainless steel cooking pot from the galley, with stainless steel rods and copper wiring. Beach noted in the ship's log: \"I could only marvel at the ingenuity of the American sailor.\"<ref>Beach.

The helm was shifted to direct gyro input, the synchro amplifiers were checked out, and the gyroscopic repeaters appeared to return to normal function.  Later, while transiting the Pearl Bank Passage, a narrow channel lined with [[coral reefs]], a periscope observation determined that ''Triton'' was off course, indicating a potentially hazardous helm error.  Steering control was immediately shifted to the control room, with the helm using the master gyroscopic repeater. While the malfunction was detected in time and the ship was not in any immediate danger, the loss of navigational bearing could have been catastrophic, with Captain Beach noting that \"the episode had a sobering effect.\"<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-57 to B-59.</ref><ref>Beach.

The change in [[salinity]] and density of the seawater caused her to dive abruptly from periscope depth to {{convert|125|ft|m}} in about 40&nbsp;seconds. Captain Beach noted, \"I had experienced changes in water density many times before, but never one of this magnitude.\" ''Triton'' returned to periscope depth and subsequently entered the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-60 to B-64.</ref><ref>Beach.

Beginning 10 April, rather than refreshing the air in the ship by snorkeling each night, she remained sealed, using compressed air to make up for consumed [[oxygen]], as well as burning \"[[oxygen candle]]s\" to replenish the ship's atmosphere. Also, starting on 15 April, the smoking lamp was extinguished, with no [[tobacco smoking]] permitted anywhere aboard the ship.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-64 to B-68.</ref><ref>Beach.

However, there was no significant difference in [[blood pressure]] between smokers and non-smokers.  Finally, smokers experienced \"debilitative performance decrements\" during the smoking prohibition, and as a consequence, this also affected the morale of non-smokers, both among the participants in the experiment as well as non-participants.  Dr. Weybrew concluded smoking should be avoided because of its attendant health and relational issues, and not smoking enhances one's overall stress coping capacity (SCC).<ref>Weybrew.

Like the voyage of Magellan, that of the ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that thru the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven thru the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.<ref>Dibner.

''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 55\u201356, 290.</ref> The plaque's eventual design consisted of a [[brass]] disk about {{convert|23|in|cm}} in diameter, bearing a sailing ship reminiscent of Magellan's carrack, ''Trinidad'', above the [[Submarine Warfare insignia|submarine dolphin insignia]] with the years 1519 and 1960 between them, all within a [[laurel wreath]]. Outside the wreath is the motto <tt>AVE NOBILIS DUX, ITERUM FACTUM EST</tt> (\"Hail Noble Captain, It Is Done Again\").<ref name=Beach5556/>\n\nCommodore Tom Henry, commanding Submarine Squadron 10, supervised the completion of the plaque. The carving of the wooden form was done by retired Chief Electrician's Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.<ref name=Beach5556/>\n\nDuring the homeward leg of her around-the-world voyage, ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} on 2 May 1960 off [[Cadiz]], Spain, the departure point for Magellan's earlier voyage. ''Triton'' broached, and ''Weeks'' transferred the finished plaque to ''Triton'' for transport back to the United States. The plaque was subsequently presented to the Spanish government by [[John Davis Lodge]], the United States Ambassador to Spain. This plaque is located at the City Hall in [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], Spain, and it is mounted on the wall of the city hall with a marble slab memorializing the 1960 ''Triton'' submerged circumnavigation.<ref name=\"Beach. pp. 263\"/>\n\nDuplicates of the Triton Plaque were also presented to the [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in [[Mystic, Connecticut]], and the [[Naval Historical Association]] in Washington, D.C., as well as the [[U.S. Navy Submarine School]] and the U.S. Navy [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]], both located in Groton, Connecticut.<ref name=\"Beach. pp. 263\"/>\n\n===Triton memorials===\n{{See also|Triton Light}}\n[[File:021201-N-0000B-001 Beach Hall 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Captain Edward L.

The route began and ended at the [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago|St. Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean near the Equator.  During the voyage, ''Triton'' crossed the Equator four times while maintaining an average speed of {{convert|18|kn}}.  ''Triton''{{'s}} overall navigational track during Operation Sandblast generally followed that of the first circumnavigation of the world led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] from 1519 to 1522.\n\nThe initial impetus for Operation Sandblast was to increase American technological and scientific prestige before the May [[1960 Paris Summit]] between President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].  It also provided a high-profile public demonstration of the capability of U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarines to carry out long-range submerged operations independent of external support and undetected by hostile forces, presaging the initial deployment of the Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[George Washington-class submarine|ballistic missile submarines]] later in 1960.  Finally, Operation Sandblast gathered extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, geophysical, and psychological data during ''Triton''{{'s}} circumnavigation.\n\nOfficial celebrations were cancelled for Operation Sandblast following the diplomatic furor arising from the [[1960 U-2 incident]] in which a U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in early May. However, ''Triton'' did receive the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe in recognition of the successful completion of its mission, and Captain Beach received the [[Legion of Merit]] for his role as ''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer.  In 1961, Beach received the [[Magellanic Premium]] from the [[American Philosophical Society]], the United States' oldest and most prestigious scientific award in \"recognition of his navigation of the U.S. submarine ''Triton'' around the globe.\"\n\n==Mission overview\u2014Project Magellan==\n{{Quotation|There is no doubt that sooner or later the USSR will put some nuclear submarine to sea.  It would be a shame if we permit them to announce this to the world by virtue of some dramatic feat which we could have done ourselves.

''Triton'' would depart as scheduled on 16 February, and the submarine would arrive back home no later than 10 May 1960.  The mission objectives for Operation Sandblast were summarized below:\n\n<blockquote>For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress \u2013 all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] \u2013 it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.<ref name=FirstB5/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Captain Beach, the Navy came up with the [[code name]] of ''Sandblast'' because it was judged that taking his ship around the world submerged would \"take a lot of sand\" on the crew's part to be successful.  Also, ''Sand'' served as Beach's personal code name during the mission.  As the captain noted:  \"Most beaches are full of sand, I was informed.\"<ref>Beach.

Now, at last, I can tell you that we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We\u2019re going around the world, nonstop. And we\u2019re going to do it entirely submerged.<ref>Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 89\u201392.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegarding the upcoming voyage, Beach adopted a decidedly non-traditional command style:\n\n<blockquote>Early on, I realized that what this particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch.  Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction.  Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications was not a problem \u2014 submariners are used to that \u2014 but bearing down too much on the job might be.  My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us.  It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up.  This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.<ref>Weybrew. ''The ABC's of Stress''. p. xii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor the shakedown cruise, Beach adopted a specific weekly shipboard routine.  Mondays and Tuesdays involved regular activities, with drills, lectures, school of the ship, and class programs from the noon to 1600 watch.  Wednesdays had the crew on reduced activities that is traditionally known as Rope Yarn Sunday.  Thursdays saw a schedule of regular drills, and Fridays involved upkeep and general maintenance activities known as Field Day.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p.

Since ''Triton'' did not have a generator to extract oxygen from sea water, these nightly snorkeling activities were crucial to maintaining a suitable atmosphere.\n\nLater that same day, 17 February 1960, ''Triton'' experienced a serious leak with a main condenser circulating water pump, and a reactor warning alarm tripped because of a defective electrical connection. Both incidents were handled successfully and did not affect the ship's performance.<ref>Beach.

It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I had a field day every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object.\"  To remove trash without surfacing, ''Triton'' had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship.  However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.<ref name=WellAroundtheWorld/><ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-10 to B-12.</ref><ref>Beach.

The first was when Chief Radarman (RDC) John R. Poole began suffering from a series of [[kidney stone]]s.  The second was when the ship's fathometer went out of commission, with its loss meaning ''Triton'' could no longer echo-sound the sea floor, increasing the danger of grounding or collision as the ship traveled through poorly charted waters.  Captain Beach observed:\n\n<blockquote>Fortunately at the present time we are in an area where the water is deeper than normal for the Atlantic and for a number of hours there is [no] worry about unexpectedly scraping the top of any unsuspected submerged peak.  But we will want that fathometer badly as we approach Cape Horn.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, p. B-22.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPerhaps most critically, the third problem involved the readings on one of the reactors indicating a serious malfunction which required its shutdown.<ref group=Note>\"In late February (1960) in the Atlantic, the USS ''Triton'' (SSN-586), shortly after departure for a submerged global circumnavigation, suffers a leak in a main condenser circulating water pump, necessitating the shutdown of the port reactor for five hours to effect repairs.\" ''Neptune Paper No. 3: Naval Accidents 1945\u20131988'' by William M. Arkin and Joshua Handler, p. 27.</ref> As Captain Beach noted, \"So far as ''Triton'' and the first of March were concerned, it seemed that troubles were not confined to pairs. On that day we were to have them in threes.\"<ref>Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. 128.</ref>\n\nLater that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his electronics technician team returned the fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and ''Triton''{{'}}s engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, ''Triton'' continued south, although there was a detour to the [[Golfo Nuevo]] region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the [[Argentine Navy]] had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but ''Triton''{{'}}s contact turned out to be a school of fish.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-22 to B-23.</ref><ref name=\"Beach. p. 116-140\">Beach.

''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 171\u2013175.</ref> On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's [[Submarine hull#Pressure hull|pressure hull]], it could not be repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, ''Triton'' could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to ''Triton''{{'}}s fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.<ref name=Beach291/>\n\nAn alternative to the fathometer was devised involving the use of the ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the combat intelligence center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the fathometer to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor.<ref name=Beach17579>Beach.

The repair required the complete re-wiring of the compressor's armature, a task ordinarily done aboard a [[submarine tender]] or in a shipyard. Captain Beach was deeply impressed by \"this spirit and outlook [that] permeated our crew.\"  He was also \"astonished\" by two different makeshift fathometer sound transmitters created by the electronics and engineering crewmen. One was based on a general announcing speaker, while the other used a stainless steel cooking pot from the galley, with stainless steel rods and copper wiring.

The helm was shifted to direct gyro input, the synchro amplifiers were checked out, and the gyroscopic repeaters appeared to return to normal function.  Later, while transiting the Pearl Bank Passage, a narrow channel lined with [[coral reefs]], a periscope observation determined that ''Triton'' was off course, indicating a potentially hazardous helm error.  Steering control was immediately shifted to the control room, with the helm using the master gyroscopic repeater. While the malfunction was detected in time and the ship was not in any immediate danger, the loss of navigational bearing could have been catastrophic, with Captain Beach noting that \"the episode had a sobering effect.\"<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-57 to B-59.</ref><ref>Beach.

The change in [[salinity]] and density of the seawater caused her to dive abruptly from periscope depth to {{convert|125|ft|m}} in about 40&nbsp;seconds. Captain Beach noted, \"I had experienced changes in water density many times before, but never one of this magnitude.\" ''Triton'' returned to periscope depth and subsequently entered the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-60 to B-64.</ref><ref>Beach.

Beginning 10 April, rather than refreshing the air in the ship by snorkeling each night, she remained sealed, using compressed air to make up for consumed [[oxygen]], as well as burning \"[[oxygen candle]]s\" to replenish the ship's atmosphere. Also, starting on 15 April, the smoking lamp was extinguished, with no [[tobacco smoking]] permitted anywhere aboard the ship.<ref>First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, pp. B-64 to B-68.</ref><ref>Beach.

However, there was no significant difference in [[blood pressure]] between smokers and non-smokers.  Finally, smokers experienced \"debilitative performance decrements\" during the smoking prohibition, and as a consequence, this also affected the morale of non-smokers, both among the participants in the experiment as well as non-participants.  Dr. Weybrew concluded smoking should be avoided because of its attendant health and relational issues, and not smoking enhances one's overall stress coping capacity (SCC).<ref>Weybrew.

Like the voyage of Magellan, that of the ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that thru the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven thru the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.<ref>Dibner.

''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 55\u201356, 290.</ref> The plaque's eventual design consisted of a [[brass]] disk about {{convert|23|in|cm}} in diameter, bearing a sailing ship reminiscent of Magellan's carrack, ''Trinidad'', above the [[Submarine Warfare insignia|submarine dolphin insignia]] with the years 1519 and 1960 between them, all within a [[laurel wreath]]. Outside the wreath is the motto <tt>AVE NOBILIS DUX, ITERUM FACTUM EST</tt> (\"Hail Noble Captain, It Is Done Again\").<ref name=Beach5556/>\n\nCommodore Tom Henry, commanding Submarine Squadron 10, supervised the completion of the plaque. The carving of the wooden form was done by retired Chief Electrician's Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.<ref name=Beach5556/>\n\nDuring the homeward leg of her around-the-world voyage, ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} on 2 May 1960 off [[Cadiz]], Spain, the departure point for Magellan's earlier voyage. ''Triton'' broached, and ''Weeks'' transferred the finished plaque to ''Triton'' for transport back to the United States. The plaque was subsequently presented to the Spanish government by [[John Davis Lodge]], the United States Ambassador to Spain. This plaque is located at the City Hall in [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], Spain, and it is mounted on the wall of the city hall with a marble slab memorializing the 1960 ''Triton'' submerged circumnavigation.<ref name=\"Beach. pp. 263\"/>\n\nDuplicates of the Triton Plaque were also presented to the [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in [[Mystic, Connecticut]], and the [[Naval Historical Association]] in Washington, D.C., as well as the [[U.S. Navy Submarine School]] and the U.S. Navy [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]], both located in Groton, Connecticut.<ref name=\"Beach. pp. 263\"/>\n\n===Triton memorials===\n{{See also|Triton Light}}\n[[File:021201-N-0000B-001 Beach Hall 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Captain Edward L.

Hay, who had served on ''Triton'' during its historic submerged around-the-world voyage.  On the editorial page of the April 2010 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:\n\n<blockquote>It is truly a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved [[Edward L. Beach Jr.|the skipper's]] ''tenacity''.  More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at anytime, and do what ever was required.  It's a good [[Nautical fiction|sea story]] about doing what had to be done.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's a good thing to do to re-read about one of the forerunners of all we've done since.<ref>{{cite journal |author= James C.
