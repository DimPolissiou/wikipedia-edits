The most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] way of decoupling water use from economic growth, according to the scientific panel, is for [[government]]s to create [[Systems ecology|holistic]] water [[Integrated water resources management|management plans]] that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, economic use, [[Water treatment|treatment]], [[Reclaimed water|recycling]], reuse and return to the environment.<ref name=\"decoupling\" />\n\n==Supply and demand==\n[[File:GlobalWaterWithdrawals.jpg|thumb|Global use of freshwater, 2016 FAO data]]\n[[File:Annualglobalwaterconsumption.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Global water consumption 1900\u20132025, by region, in billions m3 per year]]\nThe total amount of easily accessible freshwater on Earth, in the form of [[surface water]] ([[river]]s and [[lake]]s) or [[groundwater]] (in [[aquifer]]s, for example), is 14.000 cubic kilometres (nearly 3359 cubic miles).

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.<ref name=\":1\">United Nations Development Programme (2006).

It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|title = Water scarcity, risk and vulnerability|accessdate = 2 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Economic water scarcity]] is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One-quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, which is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could, therefore, help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in an already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita: in most developed countries the average amount is around 200\u2013300 liters daily. In underdeveloped countries (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique), average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organizations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1&nbsp; km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.<ref>{{cite journal| first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|journal=Journal of Modern Science|date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|location= J\u00f3zef\u00f3w|pages= 235\u2013250|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Human right to water==\n[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|In [[Meatu district]], [[Simiyu Region]], Tanzania (Africa), water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated.

During this time, they drafted the Millennium Development Goals and all 189 UN members agreed on eight goals. MDG 7 sets a target for reducing the proportion of the population without sustainable safe drinking water access by half by 2015. This would mean that more than 600 million people would gain access to a safe source of drinking water. In 2016, the  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] replaced the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n==Effects on environment==\nWater scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment, such as adverse effects on lakes, rivers, ponds, wetlands and other fresh water resources. The resulting water overuse that is related to water scarcity, often located in areas of irrigation agriculture, harms the environment in several ways including increased [[salinity]], [[nutrient pollution]], and the loss of [[floodplains]] and wetlands.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article77.html|title = Water Scarcity Index \u2013 Vital Water Graphics|accessdate = 20 October 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, water scarcity makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=J.E.

The [[U.S. Geological Survey]] estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 U.S. states, 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage.

[[Groundwater]] is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers. [[Glaciers]] provide freshwater in the form [[meltwater]], or freshwater melted from snow or ice, that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise. More and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources' usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes.

[[Natural resource extraction|Extracting]] from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed.<ref>Foster, S. and Loucks, D. 2006. ''Non-renewable Groundwater Resources''. UNESCO-IHP Groundwater series No. 10. Paris, UNESCO.</ref> Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.\n\nTo set up a big plant near a water abundant area, bottled water companies need to extract groundwater from a source at a rate more than the replenishment rate leading to the persistent decline in the groundwater levels. The groundwater is taken out, bottled, and then shipped all over the country or world and this water never goes back. When the water table depletes beyond a critical limit, bottling companies just move from that area leaving a grave water scarcity. Groundwater depletion impacts everyone and everything in the area that uses the water: farmers, businesses, animals, ecosystems, tourism and other users e.g. people reliant on a local well for potable water. Millions of gallons of water out of the ground leaves the water table depleted uniformly and not just in that area because the water table is connected across the landmass. Bottling Plants generate water scarcity and impact ecological balance. They lead to water stressed areas which bring in droughts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gasson |first1=Christopher |title=Don't waste a drop |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/dont-waste-drop-water-mining/ |website=www.globalwaterintel.com |publisher=Mining Magazine |accessdate=30 August 2018 |ref=www.globalwaterintel.com}}</ref>\n\n===Glaciers===\nGlaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to [[stream flow]].

This is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm\n |title       = Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\n |publisher   = [[UNEP]]\n |author      = Falkenmark and Lindh 1976, quoted in UNEP/WMO\n |accessdate  = 3 February 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113733/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm\n |archivedate = 26 June 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> a country or region is said to experience \"water stress\" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces \"water scarcity\".<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/LARSENST/\n  |title=Lack of Freshwater Throughout the World\n  |publisher=[[Evergreen State College]]\n  |author=Larsen, Samuel T.

This method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it. Others have related water availability to population.\n\nAnother measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007,<ref>Molden, D. (Ed). (2007) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Assessment/ ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.''] Earthscan/IWMI.</ref> aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.\n\n===Renewable freshwater resources===\nRenewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults in that it is an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIt can be observed that tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low availability of freshwater resources.\n\nThe following table is an average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies.<ref

estimate for 2025, 25 African countries are expected to suffer from water shortage or water stress.<ref>{{cite web|title=GEO-2000 overview overview|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO2000/pdfs/ov-e.pdf|website=unep.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>]]\nThe [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that, of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (1 quadrillion acre-feet) of water on [[Earth]], just 200,000 cubic kilometers (162.1 billion acre-feet) represent fresh water available for human consumption.<ref>[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution]. Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.</ref>\n\nMore than one in every six people in the world is water stressed, meaning that they do not have sufficient access to potable water.<ref name=\":1\" /> Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,<ref name=\":0\" /> a country or region is said to experience \"water stress\" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity . In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold.<ref name=\":1\" /> Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country.<ref name=\":1\" /> The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person.<ref name=\":1\" /> In China, more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.\n\n===Changes in climate===\nAnother popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of [[climate change]]. Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World\u2019s Water Problems'' FT Press (USA), 2010</ref>\n\nA New York Times article, \"Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not Global Warming\", summarizes the findings of Columbia University researcher on the subject of the droughts in the American Southeast between 2005 and 2007. The findings published in the ''Journal of Climate'' say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall. Census figures show that Georgia's population rose from 6.48 to 9.54 million between 1990 and 2007.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">Dean, Cornelia (2 October 2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/02/science/earth/02drought.html Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not Global Warming]. ''NY Times''.</ref> After studying data from weather instruments, computer models, and tree ring measurements, they found that the droughts were not unprecedented and result from normal climate patterns and random weather events. \"Similar droughts unfolded over the last thousand years\", the researchers wrote, \"Regardless of [[climate change]], they added, similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future, with similar results.\"<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> As the temperature increases, rainfall in the Southeast will increase but because of [[evaporation]] the area may get even drier. The researchers concluded with a statement saying that any rainfall comes from complicated internal processes in the atmosphere and are very hard to predict because of the large amount of variables.\n\n==Water crisis==\nWhen there is not enough [[potable water]] for a given population, the threat of a ''water crisis'' is realized.<ref name=\"Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet\">[http://c-faculty.chuo-u.ac.jp/~mikenix1/tlr/rsch/iss/water/Water%20Reading%20X.pdf Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet].

[[Marsh]]es, [[bog]]s and [[riparian zone]]s are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[wetland]]s were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a \"[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]\" of wetlands.\n\nIn [[Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. For example, many bogs in [[Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[Portlethen Moss]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].\n\n[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Madagascar Highland Plateau]] has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western rivers.]]\n\nOn [[Madagascar]]'s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that \"run red\" decades after the [[deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[coral reef]] formations in the [[Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.\nIn October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.\n\n===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===\nThere are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[human]] [[health]] and inadequate drinking water.

Wastewater treatment is highly [[capital intensive]], restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed.\n\nReducing groundwater overdrafting is generally politically unpopular, and can have major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, which has been argued to be impractical given the current population.\n\nAt more realistic levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure [[septic system]]s, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimize impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in [[hydrological transport model]]ing. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce over consumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. There measures will not only conserve [[biota (ecology)|biota]], but also render more effective the natural [[water cycle]] flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.\n\nA range of local, low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, Bedouins from the town of [[Dahab]] in Egypt have installed Aqua Danial's Water Stellar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square meters to distill from 40 to 60 liters per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mansfield |first=Barry |date=1 December 2012 |title=THE MAN WHO CAN CHANGE FIRE INTO WATER |url=http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf |work=easy Jet Traveler |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211221853/http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Managing water crises==\n[[File:Water Crisis.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Cape Town water crisis]] warning]]\nIt is alleged{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} that the likelihood of [[water conflict|conflict]] rises if the rate of change within a basin exceeds the capacity of institutions to absorb that change.<ref name=\"sciencedaily.com\" />{{failed verification|date=September 2019}} Although water crises can relate closely to regional tensions, history has shown that cases of cooperation far outnumber acute conflicts over water.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nHowever, lack of cooperation may give rise to regional conflicts in many parts of the world, specially in the global south, largely because of the disputes regarding the availability, use and management of water.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe key, therefore, lies in strong institutions and cooperation.{{cn|date=September 2019}} The [[Permanent Indus Commission |Indus River Commission]] and the 1960 [[Indus Water Treaty]] have survived two [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts| wars between India and Pakistan]] despite the two countries' mutual hostility, proving a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation, inspection and exchange of data. The [[Mekong Committee]] has functioned since 1957 and outlived the [[Vietnam War]] of 1955\u20131975. In contrast, regional instability results when countries lack institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like [[Water politics in the Nile Basin | Egypt's plan for a high dam]] on the [[Nile]]. However, {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}} no global institution supervises the management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ''ad hoc'' collaboration between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which formed due to an alliance between [[UNICEF]] and the [[US Bureau of Reclamation]]. Formation of strong international institutions seems{{or|date=September 2019}} to provide a way forward \u2013 they encourage early intervention and management,{{cn|date=September 2019}} avoiding costly [[Dispute resolution processes | dispute-resolution processes]].\n\nOne common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a \"need-based\" instead of a \"right\u2013based\" paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, and technicalities of [[project]]s define \"needs\". The success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the [[Water politics in the Jordan River basin | Jordan River Basin]], which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, the irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of the Ganges River.{{cn|date=September 2019}} A need-based, regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are  met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national-interest point-of-view and move away from a zero-sum approach to a positive-sum, integrative approach that equitably allocates water and its benefits.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[Blue Peace]] framework developed by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] in partnership with the governments of Switzerland and Sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace.

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]], the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity, as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household, industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs, but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner.<ref name=\":1\">United Nations Development Programme (2006).

It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|title = Water scarcity, risk and vulnerability|accessdate = 2 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Economic water scarcity]] is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. One-quarter of the world's population is affected by economic water scarcity. Economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure, causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water, which is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Large parts of Africa suffer from economic water scarcity; developing water infrastructure in those areas could, therefore, help to reduce poverty. Critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in an already dry environment. Consumption increases with GDP per capita: in most developed countries the average amount is around 200\u2013300 liters daily. In underdeveloped countries (e.g. African countries such as Mozambique), average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 L. This is against the backdrop of international organizations, which recommend a minimum of 20 L of water (not including the water needed for washing clothes), available at most 1&nbsp; km from the household. Increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income, as measured by GDP per capita. In countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation.<ref>{{cite journal| first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Drought and water shortages in Asia as a threat and economic problem|journal=Journal of Modern Science|date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|location= J\u00f3zef\u00f3w|pages= 235\u2013250|url= http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-95d2a7ec-8c5f-474d-84ed-8b8baed8f8c0/c/235_PDFsam_Joms_3_26_2015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Human right to water==\n[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|In [[Meatu district]], [[Simiyu Region]], Tanzania (Africa), water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated.

[[Groundwater]] is water that has pooled below the surface of the Earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells. These areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers. [[Glaciers]] provide freshwater in the form [[meltwater]], or freshwater melted from snow or ice, that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise. More and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources' usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes.

[[Natural resource extraction|Extracting]] from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed.<ref>Foster, S. and Loucks, D. 2006. ''Non-renewable Groundwater Resources''. UNESCO-IHP Groundwater series No. 10. Paris, UNESCO.</ref> Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.\n\nTo set up a big plant near a water abundant area, bottled water companies need to extract groundwater from a source at a rate more than the replenishment rate leading to the persistent decline in the groundwater levels. The groundwater is taken out, bottled, and then shipped all over the country or world and this water never goes back. When the water table depletes beyond a critical limit, bottling companies just move from that area leaving a grave water scarcity. Groundwater depletion impacts everyone and everything in the area that uses the water: farmers, businesses, animals, ecosystems, tourism and other users e.g. people reliant on a local well for potable water. Millions of gallons of water out of the ground leaves the water table depleted uniformly and not just in that area because the water table is connected across the landmass. Bottling Plants generate water scarcity and impact ecological balance. They lead to water stressed areas which bring in droughts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gasson |first1=Christopher |title=Don't waste a drop |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/dont-waste-drop-water-mining/ |website=www.globalwaterintel.com |publisher=Mining Magazine |accessdate=30 August 2018 |ref=www.globalwaterintel.com}}</ref>\n\n===Glaciers===\nGlaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to [[stream flow]].

This is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region. A popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person. For example, according to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm\n |title       = Climate Change 2001: Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability\n |publisher   = [[UNEP]]\n |author      = Falkenmark and Lindh 1976, quoted in UNEP/WMO\n |accessdate  = 3 February 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113733/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/180.htm\n |archivedate = 26 June 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> a country or region is said to experience \"water stress\" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year, the country faces \"water scarcity\".<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/LARSENST/\n  |title=Lack of Freshwater Throughout the World\n  |publisher=[[Evergreen State College]]\n  |author=Larsen, Samuel T.

This method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it. Others have related water availability to population.\n\nAnother measurement, calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007,<ref>Molden, D. (Ed). (2007) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Assessment/ ''Water for food, Water for life: A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture.''] Earthscan/IWMI.</ref> aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.\n\n===Renewable freshwater resources===\nRenewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity. This metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains. By knowing the total available water source, an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity. This metric has its faults in that it is an average; precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year. This metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals, households, industries, or the government. Lastly, as this metric is a description of a whole country, it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity. Canada and Brazil both have very high levels of available water supply, but still experience various water related problems.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIt can be observed that tropical countries in Asia and Africa have low availability of freshwater resources.\n\nThe following table is an average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies.<ref

overview|url=http://www.unep.org/geo/GEO2000/pdfs/ov-e.pdf|website=unep.org|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>]]\nThe [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that, of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (1 quadrillion acre-feet) of water on [[Earth]], just 200,000 cubic kilometers (162.1 billion acre-feet) represent fresh water available for human consumption.<ref>[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution]. Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.</ref>\n\nMore than one in every six people in the world is water stressed, meaning that they do not have sufficient access to potable water.<ref name=\":1\" /> Those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries. According to the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator,<ref name=\":0\" /> a country or region is said to experience \"water stress\" when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year. At levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, periodic or limited water shortages can be expected. When a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, the country then faces water scarcity . In 2006, about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold.<ref name=\":1\" /> Water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country.<ref name=\":1\" /> The world's most water stressed region is the Middle East with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person.<ref name=\":1\" /> In China, more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region. Much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source.\n\n===Changes in climate===\nAnother popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of [[climate change]]. Climate change has caused receding glaciers, reduced stream and river flow, and shrinking lakes and ponds. Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

The findings published in the ''Journal of Climate'' say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall.

The researchers concluded with a statement saying that any rainfall comes from complicated internal processes in the atmosphere and are very hard to predict because of the large amount of variables.\n\n==Water crisis==\nWhen there is not enough [[potable water]] for a given population, the threat of a ''water crisis'' is realized.<ref name=\"Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet\">[http://c-faculty.chuo-u.ac.jp/~mikenix1/tlr/rsch/iss/water/Water%20Reading%20X.pdf Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet].

[[Marsh]]es, [[bog]]s and [[riparian zone]]s are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply, but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished. In the case of wetlands, considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population. But other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow, as upstream sources are diverted for human use. In seven states of the U.S. over 80 percent of all historic [[wetland]]s were filled by the 1980s, when Congress acted to create a \"[[no net loss (wetlands)|no net loss]]\" of wetlands.\n\nIn [[Europe]] extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. For example, many bogs in [[Scotland]] have been developed or diminished through human population expansion. One example is the [[Portlethen Moss]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].\n\n[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Madagascar|Deforestation of the Madagascar Highland Plateau]] has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western rivers.]]\n\nOn [[Madagascar]]'s highland plateau, a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000. The [[slash and burn]] agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country's native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland. These effects were from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples, but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that \"run red\" decades after the [[deforestation]]. This eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers. Several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some, such as the disturbed Tokios [[coral reef]] formations in the [[Indian Ocean]], are effectively lost.\nIn October 2008, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and former chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world's water supply.\n\n===Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts===\nThere are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to [[human]] [[health]] and inadequate drinking water.

Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward.

Wastewater treatment is highly [[capital intensive]], restricting access to this technology in some regions; furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win. As if those factors are not daunting enough, one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed.\n\nReducing groundwater overdrafting is generally politically unpopular, and can have major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, which has been argued to be impractical given the current population.\n\nAt more realistic levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure [[septic system]]s, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimize impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in [[hydrological transport model]]ing. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce over consumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. There measures will not only conserve [[biota (ecology)|biota]], but also render more effective the natural [[water cycle]] flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.\n\nA range of local, low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, Bedouins from the town of [[Dahab]] in Egypt have installed Aqua Danial's Water Stellar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square meters to distill from 40 to 60 liters per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mansfield |first=Barry |date=1 December 2012 |title=THE MAN WHO CAN CHANGE FIRE INTO WATER |url=http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf |work=easy Jet Traveler |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211221853/http://www.barrymansfield.com/pdf/easyJet%20Traveller%20December%202012%20Egypt%20edition.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Managing water crises==\n[[File:Water Crisis.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Cape Town water crisis]] warning]]\nIt is alleged{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} that the likelihood of [[water conflict|conflict]] rises if the rate of change within a basin exceeds the capacity of institutions to absorb that change.<ref name=\"sciencedaily.com\" />{{failed verification|date=September 2019}} Although water crises can relate closely to regional tensions, history has shown that cases of cooperation far outnumber acute conflicts over water.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nHowever, lack of cooperation may give rise to regional conflicts in many parts of the world, specially in the global south, largely because of the disputes regarding the availability, use and management of water.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe key, therefore, lies in strong institutions and cooperation.{{cn|date=September 2019}} The [[Permanent Indus Commission |Indus River Commission]] and the 1960 [[Indus Water Treaty]] have survived two [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts| wars between India and Pakistan]] despite the two countries' mutual hostility, proving a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation, inspection and exchange of data. The [[Mekong Committee]] has functioned since 1957 and outlived the [[Vietnam War]] of 1955\u20131975. In contrast, regional instability results when countries lack institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like [[Water politics in the Nile Basin | Egypt's plan for a high dam]] on the [[Nile]]. However, {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}} no global institution supervises the management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ''ad hoc'' collaboration between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which formed due to an alliance between [[UNICEF]] and the [[US Bureau of Reclamation]]. Formation of strong international institutions seems{{or|date=September 2019}} to provide a way forward \u2013 they encourage early intervention and management,{{cn|date=September 2019}} avoiding costly [[Dispute resolution processes | dispute-resolution processes]].\n\nOne common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a \"need-based\" instead of a \"right\u2013based\" paradigm. Irrigable lands, population, and technicalities of [[project]]s define \"needs\". The success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the [[Water politics in the Jordan River basin | Jordan River Basin]], which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians. In the Indian subcontinent, the irrigation requirements of Bangladesh determine water allocations of the Ganges River.{{cn|date=September 2019}} A need-based, regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water, ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are  met. It removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national-interest point-of-view and move away from a zero-sum approach to a positive-sum, integrative approach that equitably allocates water and its benefits.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[Blue Peace]] framework developed by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] in partnership with the governments of Switzerland and Sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace. By making the most of shared water-resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries, the chances for peace can increase.<ref>''Turkish Review'', March 2013</ref>{{qn|date=September 2019}} The Blue Peace approach has proven effective in (for example) the Middle East<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue+Peace_Middle+East.pdf|title= Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|website= www.strategicforesight.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.deza.admin.ch/en/Home/Projects/Selected_projects/Water_management_and_peace_promotion_in_the_Middle_East eda.base.components.templates.base.accessKeys].

{"title_page": "List of battles involving the Sikh Empire", "text_new": "The [[Sikh Empire]] (1799 \u2013 1849 CE) was established by Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]. Throughout its history, it fought various adversaries including the [[Durrani Empire]] of [[Afghanistan]] and the [[British East India Company]]. The Sikhs very commonly fought battles in which they had much less force than their foes. However, they had an impressive success rate.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Sikh]]s first raised their weapons against the [[Mughals|Mughal Empire]] under [[Guru Hargobind]]. The tenth and the last Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] organized Sikhs into a military sect called [[Khalsa]] (means \"pure\"), in 1699, against the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]]. Before his death in 1708, he sent [[Banda Bahadur]] to lead the Sikhs of [[Punjab]]. Banda Bahadur through his outstanding leadership skills weakened the Mughal grasp over the eastern Punjab. But he was later captured and beheaded in Delhi in 1716, during the reign of [[Farrukhsiyar]].\n\nThereafter, Sikhs became leaderless and were divided into [[Misl]]s. Although their martial skills were enormous, their political disunity made them vulnerable to foreign attacks. In 1738, [[Nadir Shah]] of [[Afsharid Dynasty|Iran]], [[Nadir Shah's invasion of India|attacked India]] , looted [[Delhi]] and Mughals were never able to recover their power in Punjab. Later, Punjab was subject to constant invasions of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali|Ahmad Shah Durrani]] of [[Durrani Empire|Afghanistan]], who upon hearing of the persecution of Muslims of Punjab by the invading Sikhs, took it as his duty to protect the Muslims. During every invasion of Abdali, defeated the Sikhs. According to some the scene outside the holy shrine of [[Harmandir Sahib]] was the scene of one of these battles.\n\nAbdali tried many times to recover Lahore but ultimately had to return to [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] territories. After his final invasion of Punjab in 1767, he left Lahore which was when it was re-captured by the Sikhs. For more than three decades, Sikhs consolidated their power in areas of Punjab. But the decisive moment came in 1790, when [[Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sukerchakia]] misl became misldar. He started uniting misls and finally took Lahore in 1799. His coronation on 12 April 1801 marked the beginning of the [[Sikh Empire]], which went on to conquer the whole Punjab, Kangra, parts of Kashmir and briefly, the city of Peshawar.\n\n==Battles fought by Sikhs==\n# [[Battle of Rohilla]] (1621)\n# [[Battle of Kartarpur]] (1635)\n# [[Battle of Amritsar (1634)]]\n# [[Battle of Lahira]] (1634)\n# [[Battle of Bhangani]] (1688)\n# [[Battle of Nadaun]] (1691)\n# [[Battle of Guler (1696)]]\n# [[Battle of Basoli]] (1702)\n# [[Battle of Anandpur (1700)]]\n# [[Battle of Nirmohgarh (1702)]]\n# [[Battle of Anandpur (1701)]]\n# [[First Battle of Chamkaur (1702)]]\n# [[First Battle of Anandpur (1704)]]\n# [[Second Battle of Anandpur|Second Battle of Anandpur (1704)]]\n# [[Battle of Sarsa|Battle of Sarsa (1704)]]\n# [[Second Battle of Chamkaur (1704)]]\n# [[Battle of Muktsar]]<ref>{{cite book |last=McLeod |first=W.

Throughout its history, it fought various adversaries including the [[Durrani Empire]] of [[Afghanistan]] and the [[British East India Company]]. The Sikhs very commonly fought battles in which they had much less force than their foes. However, they had an impressive success rate.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Sikh]]s first raised their weapons against the [[Mughals|Mughal Empire]] under [[Guru Hargobind]]. The tenth and the last Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] organized Sikhs into a military sect called [[Khalsa]] (means \"pure\"), in 1699, against the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]]. Before his death in 1708, he sent [[Banda Bahadur]] to lead the Sikhs of [[Punjab]]. Banda Bahadur through his outstanding leadership skills weakened the Mughal grasp over the eastern Punjab. But he was later captured and beheaded in Delhi in 1716, during the reign of [[Farrukhsiyar]].\n\nThereafter, Sikhs became leaderless and were divided into [[Misl]]s. Although their martial skills were enormous, their political disunity made them vulnerable to foreign attacks. In 1738, [[Nadir Shah]] of [[Afsharid Dynasty|Iran]], [[Nadir Shah's invasion of India|attacked India]] , looted [[Delhi]] and Mughals were never able to recover their power in Punjab. Later, Punjab was subject to constant invasions of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali|Ahmad Shah Durrani]] of [[Durrani Empire|Afghanistan]], who upon hearing of the persecution of Muslims of Punjab by the invading Sikhs, took it as his duty to protect the Muslims. During every invasion of Abdali, defeated the Sikhs. According to some the scene outside the holy shrine of [[Harmandir Sahib]] was the scene of one of these battles.\n\nAbdali tried many times to recover Lahore but ultimately had to return to [[Pashtun]] territories. After his final invasion of Punjab in 1767, he left Lahore which was when it was re-captured by the Sikhs. For more than three decades, Sikhs consolidated their power in areas of Punjab. But the decisive moment came in 1790, when [[Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sukerchakia]] misl became misldar. He started uniting misls and finally took Lahore in 1799. His coronation on 12 April 1801 marked the beginning of the [[Sikh Empire]], which went on to conquer the whole Punjab, Kangra, parts of Kashmir and briefly, the city of Peshawar.\n\n==Battles fought by Sikhs==\n# [[Battle of Rohilla]] (1621)\n# [[Battle of Kartarpur]] (1635)\n# [[Battle of Amritsar (1634)]]\n# [[Battle of Lahira]] (1634)\n# [[Battle of Bhangani]] (1688)\n# [[Battle of Nadaun]] (1691)\n# [[Battle of Guler (1696)]]\n# [[Battle of Basoli]] (1702)\n# [[Battle of Anandpur (1700)]]\n# [[Battle of Nirmohgarh (1702)]]\n# [[Battle of Anandpur (1701)]]\n# [[First Battle of Chamkaur (1702)]]\n# [[First Battle of Anandpur (1704)]]\n# [[Second Battle of Anandpur|Second Battle of Anandpur (1704)]]\n# [[Battle of Sarsa|Battle of Sarsa (1704)]]\n# [[Second Battle of Chamkaur (1704)]]\n# [[Battle of Muktsar]]<ref>{{cite book |last=McLeod |first=W.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprising of kolis placed in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprising of kolis placed in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.
