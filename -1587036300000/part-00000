Initially designated '''engineer amphibian brigades''', they were redesignated engineer special brigades in 1943. The 1st, 5th, and 6th Engineer Special Brigades were assigned to the [[European Theater of Operations]]. The 1st Engineer Special Brigade participating in the landings in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]] before joining the 5th and 6th Engineer Special Brigades for the invasion of [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]].\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th Engineer Special Brigades were assigned to the [[Southwest Pacific Area]], and participated in the campaigns in the [[Operation Dexterity|Bismarck Archipelago]], [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]], [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Southern Philippines]] and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]]. The 1st Engineer Special Brigade fought in both theaters of the war, participating in the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]] near the end of the war. The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade remained active after the war, and served in the [[Korean War]] before being inactivated in 1955.\n\n== Concept ==\n\nAt the onset of direct American involvement in [[World War II]], it became apparent that the United States would need a large strategic and tactical [[amphibious warfare]] capability. In 1941, the amphibious forces were divided into two [[corps]]: one in the Atlantic, and one in the Pacific. Both were combined [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] commands, administered by the [[United States Navy]]. The Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet, consisted of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] and the [[1st Marine Division]], while the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, consisted of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Marine Division]].{{sfn|Becker|1946|p=1}}\n\nIn April 1942, the United States and United Kingdom agreed on plans for an emergency invasion of Northwest Europe in the late northern summer of 1942 ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]) that would be conducted in the event of signs that the [[Soviet Union]] was on the brink of collapse, or that the Germans were withdrawing from Western Europe, possibly due to an internal coup or collapse. This would be followed by a full-scale crossing of the English Channel in mid-1943 ([[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]]). These were envisaged as shore-to-shore operations. The US Navy's policy at this time of only taking volunteers meant that it was short of manpower, and those personnel it had available were mainly allocated warships and the amphibious ships required for ship-to-shore operations. This meant that the landing craft for Sledgehammer would have to be operated by the British and the US Army.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=360\u2013361}}\n\n== Amphibious Training Center ==\nThe [[Joint Staff]] then considered the issue of amphibious warfare training. Very large scale operations were contemplated in both Europe and the Pacific, which the Army would have to conduct. To have the Marines carry out all amphibious operations was impractical, as there were limitations on its size, and joint Army-Marine amphibious operations would involve problems of coordination in view of their different organization, doctrine and procedures. The Joint Staff planners therefore felt that the Army should conduct amphibious training. This meant that the Army would have to establish its own amphibious training establishment.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[File:Steeplechase2.jpg|thumb|left|Training at [[Camp Edwards]], Massachusetts]]\nThe Joint Staff hoped to have twelve Army [[Division (military)|divisions]] (eleven infantry and one armored) trained in amphibious warfare by 1 February 1943. Another two infantry divisions and one armored division would receive training overseas. This did not include the 1st, 3rd and [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Divisions]], which were already undergoing training, the 3rd on the West Coast and the 1st and 9th on the East coast. In addition, the Army would train enough boat crews to move eight divisions. These would also be available by 1 February 1943. The Joint Staff intended to create three amphibious training centers.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=2\u20133}} The plan was to train four divisions at [[Camp Edwards, Massachusetts]], six at [[Camp Gordon Johnston|Camp Carrabelle, Florida]] and two at [[Fort Lewis, Washington]]. It was intended that training at Camp Edwards would be conducted between July and November 1942. The [[Army Ground Forces]] was given responsibility for the development of amphibious warfare doctrine and the conduct of unit training.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nThe Army activated its Amphibious Training Center at Camp Edwards on 22 May 1942, with [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Frank A. Keating]], the chief of staff of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], assigned to command it. It became active on 15 June 1942.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=5\u20137}} The [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] underwent training at Camp Edwards from 15 July to 20 August 1942. Training concluded with major amphibious maneuvers from 17 to 19 August, during which the division conducted a shore-to-shore operation, embarking from [[Washburn Island, Massachusetts]], and crossing [[Vineyard Sound]] to land on [[Martha's Vineyard]], about {{convert|6|mi}} away. It was followed by the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]], which arrived on 22 August, and completed its training on 3 October. The final three days saw a repeat of the shore-to-shore exercise the 45th had conducted.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=10\u201312}}\n[[File:Amphibian engineers land 45th Division troops at Cape Cod.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Amphibian engineers land 45th Division troops at Cape Cod using the old LCPs]]\nThe Amphibious Training Center moved to Camp Carrabelle in October 1942. The first formation to undergo training there was the [[38th Infantry Division (United States)|38th Infantry Division]], which commenced its amphibious warfare training there on 23 November 1942. The final shore-to-shore amphibious maneuver was conducted on 17 to 19 December, but performance was not considered satisfactory by the Amphibious Training Center staff, and it was repeated on 28 to 30 December. Camp Carrabelle was renamed Camp Gordon Johnston 13 January 1943. The [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]] commenced training on 28 January 1943, and conducted its landing exercise on 7 to 9 March. This was the last division to be trained by the Amphibious Training Center, although three separate battalions, the 81st Chemical Battalion, 61st Medical Battalion and 462nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, received training there in May 1943.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=12\u201314}}\n\nOn 10 March 1943, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], General [[George Marshall]], and the Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Fleet]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], entered into an agreement that amphibious training would henceforth be a Navy responsibility. The Army Ground Forces was relieved of responsibility for the Amphibious Training Center on 16 March, and it was closed on 10 June.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=14\u201317}}\n\n== Engineer Amphibian Command ==\nIn addition to training combat units in amphibious warfare, the Army also had to train personnel in the operation and maintenance of landing craft.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=361}} Operating the necessary landing craft was estimated to require 48,000 men, organized into 18 boat operating regiments and seven boat maintenance battalions.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=361}} Each boat regiment had three battalions, each of three boat companies.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=365}} It was agreed with the British that boat units deploying to the UK would receive their initial training in the US, and final training in the UK. A consequence was the amphibian engineers' adoption of the British [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Combined Operations]] shoulder patch, but with the colors switched to gold on blue. The [[War Department]] also authorized the wearing of a pocket patch showing a scarlet seahorse on a white background, these being the colors of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Ogden, Sturdevant, Noce and Trudeau.jpg|thumb|left|Left to right: Brigadier Generals [[David Ayres Depue Ogden|David Ogden]], [[Clarence Sturdevant]], [[Daniel Noce]] and Colonel [[Arthur Trudeau]] at [[Camp Edwards, Massachusetts]] in October 1942.]]\nThe Engineer Amphibian Command was created on 10 June 1942 at Camp Edwards, under the command of Colonel [[Daniel Noce]], with [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Arthur Trudeau]] as his chief of staff. Noce was answerable to [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Clarence Sturdevant]],{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=361}} the Assistant Chief of Engineers for training.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=131}} Additional training facilities were established at [[Cape Cod]]. The beach south of [[Buzzards Bay]] was selected for shore facilities, and Washburn Island was leased as a training site. Some $1.6&nbsp;million was spent on dredging and the construction of roads, camps, piers and utilities.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=363\u2013364}}\n\nNoce and Trudeau considered how the boat units would operate in combat, and noted the importance of well-trained shore parties to load and unload the boats, and establish supply dumps on the far shore. Since combat engineers were not specifically trained for the task, and would in any case have their hands full dealing with obstacles and fortifications, they felt that a permanent organization was required. They drew up a structure for an engineer shore regiment that would combine the functions of a Navy beach party and the Marine Corps shore party. About half the size of a boat regiment, a shore regiment would consist of three battalions, each with a near shore company and two far shore companies. Each shore regiment would be grouped with a boat regiment, a boat maintenance battalion, and support units to form an engineer amphibian brigade capable of moving an entire infantry division. The proposed organization was approved, and authority was granted to form eight engineer amphibian brigades.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=362\u2013363}}\n\nThe [[table of organization and equipment]] for an engineer amphibian brigade provided for 349 officers, 20 warrant officers, and 6,814 enlisted men. The Army searched its personnel records for men with appropriate marine experience.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=365}} Arrangements were made to train ships' carpenters and marine mechanics at the [[Gray Marine Motor Company]] in Michigan, [[Higgins Industries]] in Louisiana, and [[Evinrude Outboard Motors]] and the [[Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company]] in Wisconsin. In all, 3,368 personnel were trained by these companies. Another 1,481 were trained at the Army Ordnance School at [[Aberdeen, Maryland]], the Naval Operating Base at [[Toledo, Ohio]], and the Army Motor School at [[Fort Holabird]], Maryland. The majority, some 33,627 men, were trained at schools run by the Engineer Amphibian Command.{{sfn|Heavey|1988|pp=10\u201311}} Instructors were obtained from the [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], and the [[United States Coast Guard]], Marine Corps and [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]].{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=368}} Of the 37,651 enlisted men assigned between 10 June 1942 and 31 December 1943, 20,244 came from replacement centers, 11,898 from reception centers and 5,509 from other units; of the 2,899 officers, 634 came from other units, 825 from the Officer Reserve Corps, 965 from Officer Candidate Schools, and 475 through direct commissioning from civilian life.{{sfn|Casey|1959|p=20}}\n\n[[File:A jeep comes ashore over Sommerfeld track in a training exercise at Camp Edwards.jpg|thumb|right|A jeep comes ashore over Sommerfeld track in a training exercise at Camp Edwards]]\nThe Engineer Amphibian Command estimated that it required 1,000 {{convert|36|ft|adj=on}} landing craft and 225 {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} tank lighters, but it was soon discovered that this exceeded the number available. The Navy agreed to turn over 300 36-foot craft from new production in June and July.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=363\u2013364}} Initially the Engineer Amphibian Command used whatever landing craft were available: the 36-foot landing craft, personnel (LCP); landing craft, ramp (LCR); landing craft, personnel (ramp) (LCP(R)); and landing craft, vehicle (LCV);{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=15}} and a small number of the 50-foot [[landing craft, mechanized]] (LCM). Some were petrol-, and some diesel-powered. The 36-foot boats were later superseded by the [[landing craft, vehicle, personnel]] (LCVP), which combined their attributes.{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=23}}\n\nThe shortage of landing craft meant that enough were available for only one boat battalion at a time. The practice of allocating the boats to one battalion at a time, while the only way that all battalions could be trained, annoyed the Amphibious Training Center, as it meant that its ground units were always training with inexperienced boat crews.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=373}} Tests were carried out with the newly-developed [[DUKW]], and it was decided that each brigade should be equipped with three of them.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=376}} An important organizational change as a result of experience with training occurred on 5 September, when Noce decided to group the boat and shore engineers into three boat and shore regiments, each with one boat and one shore battalion. Each boat and shore regiment could work with one of the three infantry regiments in an infantry division.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=376}}\n\nWhile the Navy was still willing to allow the Army to operate landing craft, it reserved the right to operate ocean-going landing ships. A dispute arose over which category the larger {{convert|105|ft|adj=on}} [[Landing craft, tank]] (LCT) belonged to. The LCT was powered by the same Gray [[marine diesel engine]] as the LCVP and LCM, so no special training was required operate or maintain it. The Engineer Amphibian Command was informed on 21 May 1942 that the Navy had agreed that the Army could operate LCTs, but the British then decided that the LCT was a landing ship after all, and on 29 June the Navy announced that it would be operating the LCTs. This came as a blow to the Engineer Amphibian Command, as it meant that it was dependent on the Navy to transport its larger pieces of equipment like the [[D8 bulldozer]].{{sfn|Casey|1959|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Engineer trainees Land a 75 mm gun.jpg|thumb|left|Engineer trainees land a 75 mm gun]]\nThe Navy also announced that it would take over the operation of all landing craft as soon as possible. The reason for this was that Sledgehammer had been abandoned in favor of an invasion of French Northwest Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), a ship-to-shore operation, and plans for the 1943 cross-Channel invasion operation were scaled back on 1 July from twelve to eight divisions. The number of engineer amphibian brigades was cut from eight to five; on 17 August it was reduced to just three.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=369\u2013372}} Given the additional time, the Navy now believed that it could train all boat crews, but the absorption of the engineer amphibian brigades into the Navy was precluded by the fact that they contained draftees, which the Navy was still refusing to take accept.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=376\u2013378}}\n\nUncertainty about the future became acute as the year wore on, as Camp Edwards was unsuitable for boat operations in winter. The Amphibious Training Center moved to Camp Carrabelle in October, taking the 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade with it, but left the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade at Camp Edwards. Up to this point, all plans had revolved around operations in Europe, as the war against Germany had priority, although in planning for amphibious training for twelve divisions, the War Department had also been providing for operations in the Pacific. In the wake of the US victory in the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, plans were advanced for offensive operations in the Pacific, particularly in the Solomon Islands.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=379\u2013380}}\n\n[[File:LCT-349 assists in a training exercise.jpg|thumb|right|LCT-349 assists in a training exercise]]\nAmphibious operations in the [[Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) depended on the availability of landing craft. The Navy intended to ship only 60 per month to the theater, as they had to be sent deckloaded on ships bound for Australia, as they were too large to fit into ships' holds. Trudeau proposed shipping them as components. In this way hundreds could be carried in a ship's hold. They could the assembled in Australia by the 411th Base Shop Battalion. The decision to ship the 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade to Australia freed accommodation at Camp Carrabelle for the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade, although it meant that yet another cycle of training would be conducted with inexperienced boat crews. On 27 November, MacArthur asked for two more brigades. He also recommended that their name be changed from \"amphibian\" to \"special\".{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=380\u2013386}}\n\nVoluntary enlistment in the Navy of men aged 18 to 37 ended on 5 December 1942; henceforth men in this age group could be obtained only through the draft.{{sfn|Furer|1959|p=279}} This cleared the way for absorption of the Army boat crews into the Navy. On 8 March 1943, the War and [[Navy Department]]s agreed that landing craft should be operated by the Navy, but exempted the three engineer special brigades allocated to SWPA. The 4th Engineer Special Brigade completed its training at Camp Edwards in August 1943, and then moved to Camp Gordon Johnston, where it conducted joint training with the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]]. After it departed for Australia in December 1943, the Engineer Amphibian Command provided instruction to replacement crews before being disbanded in April 1944.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=385\u2013389}}\n\n== 1st Engineer Special Brigade ==\nThe 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated at Camp Edwards on 15 June 1942.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=365\u2013368}} Some 2,269 men were transferred from existing unit, the 37th Engineer Combat Regiment providing the nucleus of the boat regiment, and the 87th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion that of the shore regiment.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=365\u2013368}} Brigadier General [[Henry C. Wolfe]] was assigned as commanding general on 7 July 1942.{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=16}} The brigade trained until 15 July, when it was assigned to the Amphibious Training Command.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=365\u2013368}}\n\n[[File:Monument for the 1st Engineer Special Brigade on Utah Beach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Monument for the 1st Engineer Special Brigade on Utah Beach]]\nThe brigade was pulled from the Amphibious Training Center early and sent to England to participate in Operation Sledgehammer, departing from the [[New York Port of Embarkation]] on 5 August, and arriving on 17 August.{{sfn|Stanton|1984|p=513}} Elements of the brigade participated in the Operation Torch.

The 1st Engineer Special Brigade participating in the landings in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]] before joining the 5th and 6th Engineer Special Brigades for the invasion of [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]].\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th Engineer Special Brigades were assigned to the [[Southwest Pacific Area]], and participated in the campaigns in the [[Operation Dexterity|Bismarck Archipelago]], [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]], [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], the [[Philippines campaign (1944\u20131945)|Southern Philippines]] and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaign]]. The 1st Engineer Special Brigade fought in both theaters of the war, participating in the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]] near the end of the war. The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade remained active after the war, and served in the [[Korean War]] before being inactivated in 1955.\n\n== Concept ==\n\nAt the onset of direct American involvement in [[World War II]], it became apparent that the United States would need a large strategic and tactical [[amphibious warfare]] capability. In 1941, the amphibious forces were divided into two [[corps]]: one in the Atlantic, and one in the Pacific. Both were combined [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] commands, administered by the [[United States Navy]]. The Amphibious Corps, Atlantic Fleet, consisted of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] and the [[1st Marine Division]], while the Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, consisted of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Marine Division]].{{sfn|Becker|1946|p=1}}\n\nIn April 1942, the United States and United Kingdom agreed on plans for an emergency invasion of Northwest Europe in the late northern summer of 1942 ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]) that would be conducted in the event of signs that the [[Soviet Union]] was on the brink of collapse, or that the Germans were withdrawing from Western Europe, possibly due to an internal coup or collapse. This would be followed by a full-scale crossing of the English Channel in mid-1943 ([[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]]). These were envisaged as shore-to-shore operations. The US Navy's policy at this time of only taking volunteers meant that it was short of manpower, and those personnel it had available were mainly allocated warships and the amphibious ships required for ship-to-shore operations. This meant that the landing craft for Sledgehammer would have to be operated by the British and the US Army.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=360\u2013361}}\n\n== Amphibious Training Center ==\nThe [[Joint Staff]] then considered the issue of amphibious warfare training. Very large scale operations were contemplated in both Europe and the Pacific, which the Army would have to conduct. To have the Marines carry out all amphibious operations was impractical, as there were limitations on its size, and joint Army-Marine amphibious operations would involve problems of coordination in view of their different organization, doctrine and procedures. The Joint Staff planners therefore felt that the Army should conduct amphibious training. This meant that the Army would have to establish its own amphibious training establishment.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[File:Steeplechase2.jpg|thumb|left|Training at [[Camp Edwards]], Massachusetts]]\nThe Joint Staff hoped to have twelve Army [[Division (military)|divisions]] (eleven infantry and one armored) trained in amphibious warfare by 1 February 1943. Another two infantry divisions and one armored division would receive training overseas. This did not include the 1st, 3rd and [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Divisions]], which were already undergoing training, the 3rd on the West Coast and the 1st and 9th on the East coast. In addition, the Army would train enough boat crews to move eight divisions. These would also be available by 1 February 1943. The Joint Staff intended to create three amphibious training centers.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=2\u20133}} The plan was to train four divisions at [[Camp Edwards, Massachusetts]], six at [[Camp Gordon Johnston|Camp Carrabelle, Florida]] and two at [[Fort Lewis, Washington]]. It was intended that training at Camp Edwards would be conducted between July and November 1942. The [[Army Ground Forces]] was given responsibility for the development of amphibious warfare doctrine and the conduct of unit training.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nThe Army activated its Amphibious Training Center at Camp Edwards on 22 May 1942, with [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Frank A. Keating]], the chief of staff of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], assigned to command it. It became active on 15 June 1942.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=5\u20137}} The [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] underwent training at Camp Edwards from 15 July to 20 August 1942. Training concluded with major amphibious maneuvers from 17 to 19 August, during which the division conducted a shore-to-shore operation, embarking from [[Washburn Island, Massachusetts]], and crossing [[Vineyard Sound]] to land on [[Martha's Vineyard]], about {{convert|6|mi}} away. It was followed by the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]], which arrived on 22 August, and completed its training on 3 October. The final three days saw a repeat of the shore-to-shore exercise the 45th had conducted.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=10\u201312}}\n[[File:Amphibian engineers land 45th Division troops at Cape Cod.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Amphibian engineers land 45th Division troops at Cape Cod using the old LCPs]]\nThe Amphibious Training Center moved to Camp Carrabelle in October 1942. The first formation to undergo training there was the [[38th Infantry Division (United States)|38th Infantry Division]], which commenced its amphibious warfare training there on 23 November 1942. The final shore-to-shore amphibious maneuver was conducted on 17 to 19 December, but performance was not considered satisfactory by the Amphibious Training Center staff, and it was repeated on 28 to 30 December. Camp Carrabelle was renamed Camp Gordon Johnston 13 January 1943. The [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]] commenced training on 28 January 1943, and conducted its landing exercise on 7 to 9 March. This was the last division to be trained by the Amphibious Training Center, although three separate battalions, the 81st Chemical Battalion, 61st Medical Battalion and 462nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, received training there in May 1943.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=12\u201314}}\n\nOn 10 March 1943, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], General [[George Marshall]], and the Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Fleet]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], entered into an agreement that amphibious training would henceforth be a Navy responsibility. The Army Ground Forces was relieved of responsibility for the Amphibious Training Center on 16 March, and it was closed on 10 June.{{sfn|Becker|1946|pp=14\u201317}}\n\n== Engineer Amphibian Command ==\nIn addition to training combat units in amphibious warfare, the Army also had to train personnel in the operation and maintenance of landing craft.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=361}} Operating the necessary landing craft was estimated to require 48,000 men, organized into 18 boat operating regiments and seven boat maintenance battalions.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=361}} Each boat regiment had three battalions, each of three boat companies.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=365}} It was agreed with the British that boat units deploying to the UK would receive their initial training in the US, and final training in the UK. A consequence was the amphibian engineers' adoption of the British [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Combined Operations]] shoulder patch, but with the colors switched to gold on blue. The [[War Department]] also authorized the wearing of a pocket patch showing a scarlet seahorse on a white background, these being the colors of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Ogden, Sturdevant, Noce and Trudeau.jpg|thumb|left|Left to right: Brigadier Generals [[David Ayres Depue Ogden|David Ogden]], [[Clarence Sturdevant]], [[Daniel Noce]] and Colonel [[Arthur Trudeau]] at [[Camp Edwards, Massachusetts]] in October 1942.]]\nThe Engineer Amphibian Command was created on 10 June 1942 at Camp Edwards, under the command of Colonel [[Daniel Noce]], with [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Arthur Trudeau]] as his chief of staff. Noce was answerable to [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Clarence Sturdevant]],{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=361}} the Assistant Chief of Engineers for training.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=131}} Additional training facilities were established at [[Cape Cod]]. The beach south of [[Buzzards Bay]] was selected for shore facilities, and Washburn Island was leased as a training site. Some $1.6&nbsp;million was spent on dredging and the construction of roads, camps, piers and utilities.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=363\u2013364}}\n\nNoce and Trudeau considered how the boat units would operate in combat, and noted the importance of well-trained shore parties to load and unload the boats, and establish supply dumps on the far shore. Since combat engineers were not specifically trained for the task, and would in any case have their hands full dealing with obstacles and fortifications, they felt that a permanent organization was required. They drew up a structure for an engineer shore regiment that would combine the functions of a Navy beach party and the Marine Corps shore party. About half the size of a boat regiment, a shore regiment would consist of three battalions, each with a near shore company and two far shore companies.  Each shore regiment would be grouped with a boat regiment, a boat maintenance battalion, and support units to form an engineer amphibian brigade capable of moving an entire infantry division. The proposed organization was approved, and authority was granted to form eight engineer amphibian brigades.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=362\u2013363}}\n\nThe [[table of organization and equipment]] for an engineer amphibian brigade provided for 349 officers, 20 warrant officers, and 6,814 enlisted men. The Army searched its personnel records for men with appropriate marine experience.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=365}} Arrangements were made to train ships' carpenters and marine mechanics at the [[Gray Marine Motor Company]] in Michigan, [[Higgins Industries]] in Louisiana, and [[Evinrude Outboard Motors]] and the [[Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company]] in Wisconsin. In all, 3,368 personnel were trained by these companies. Another 1,481 were trained at the Army Ordnance School at [[Aberdeen, Maryland]], the Naval Operating Base at [[Toledo, Ohio]], and the Army Motor School at [[Fort Holabird]], Maryland. The majority, some 33,627 men, were trained at schools run by the Engineer Amphibian Command.{{sfn|Heavey|1988|pp=10\u201311}} Instructors were obtained from the [[British Army]], [[Royal Navy]], and the [[United States Coast Guard]], Marine Corps and [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|Coast and Geodetic Survey]].{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=368}} Of the 37,651 enlisted men assigned between 10 June 1942 and 31 December 1943, 20,244 came from replacement centers, 11,898 from reception centers and 5,509 from other units; of the 2,899 officers, 634 came from other units, 825 from the Officer Reserve Corps, 965 from Officer Candidate Schools, and 475 through direct commissioning from civilian life.{{sfn|Casey|1959|p=20}}\n\n[[File:A jeep comes ashore over Sommerfeld track in a training exercise at Camp Edwards.jpg|thumb|right|A jeep comes ashore over Sommerfeld track in a training exercise at Camp Edwards]]\nThe Engineer Amphibian Command estimated that it required 1,000 {{convert|36|ft|adj=on}} landing craft and 225 {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}}  tank lighters, but it was soon discovered that this exceeded the number available. The Navy agreed to turn over 300 36-foot craft from new production in June and July.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=363\u2013364}} Initially the Engineer Amphibian Command used whatever landing craft were available: the 36-foot landing craft, personnel (LCP); landing craft, ramp (LCR); landing craft, personnel (ramp) (LCP(R)); and landing craft, vehicle (LCV);{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=15}} and a small number of the 50-foot [[landing craft, mechanized]] (LCM). Some were petrol-, and some diesel-powered. The 36-foot boats were later superseded by the [[landing craft, vehicle, personnel]] (LCVP), which combined their attributes.{{sfn|Heavey|1988|p=23}}\n\nThe shortage of landing craft meant that enough were available for only one boat battalion at a time. The practice of allocating the boats to one battalion at a time, while the only way that all battalions could be trained, annoyed the Amphibious Training Center, as it meant that its ground units were always training with inexperienced boat crews.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=373}} Tests were carried out with the newly-developed [[DUKW]], and it was decided that each brigade should be equipped with three of them.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=376}} An important organizational change as a result of experience with training occurred on 5 September, when Noce decided to group the boat and shore engineers into three boat and shore regiments, each with one boat and one shore battalion. Each boat and shore regiment could work with one of the three infantry regiments in an infantry division.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|p=376}}\n\nWhile the Navy was still willing to allow the Army to operate landing craft, it reserved the right to operate ocean-going landing ships. A dispute arose over which category the larger {{convert|105|ft|adj=on}} [[Landing craft, tank]] (LCT) belonged to. The LCT was powered by the same Gray [[marine diesel engine]] as the LCVP and LCM, so no special training was required operate or maintain it. The Engineer Amphibian Command was informed on 21 May 1942 that the Navy had agreed that the Army could operate LCTs, but the British then decided that the LCT was a landing ship after all, and on 29 June the Navy announced that it would be operating the LCTs. This came as a blow to the Engineer Amphibian Command, as it meant that it was dependent on the Navy to transport its larger pieces of equipment like the [[D8 bulldozer]].{{sfn|Casey|1959|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Engineer trainees Land a 75 mm gun.jpg|thumb|left|Engineer trainees land a 75 mm gun]]\nThe Navy also announced that it would take over the operation of all landing craft as soon as possible. The reason for this was that Sledgehammer had been abandoned in favor of an invasion of French Northwest Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), a ship-to-shore operation, and plans for the 1943 cross-Channel invasion operation were scaled back on 1 July from twelve to eight divisions. The number of engineer amphibian brigades was cut from eight to five; on 17 August it was reduced to just three.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=369\u2013372}} Given the additional time, the Navy now believed that it could train all boat crews, but the absorption of the engineer amphibian brigades into the Navy was precluded by the fact that they contained draftees, which the Navy was still refusing to take accept.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=376\u2013378}}\n\nUncertainty about the future became acute as the year wore on, as Camp Edwards was unsuitable for boat operations in winter. The Amphibious Training Center moved to Camp Carrabelle in October, taking the 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade with it, but left the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade at Camp Edwards. Up to this point, all plans had revolved around operations in Europe, as the war against Germany had priority, although in planning for amphibious training for twelve divisions, the War Department had also been providing for operations in the Pacific. In the wake of the US victory in the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, plans were advanced for offensive operations in the Pacific, particularly in the Solomon Islands.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=379\u2013380}}\n\n[[File:LCT-349 assists in a training exercise.jpg|thumb|right|LCT-349 assists in a training exercise]]\nAmphibious operations in the [[Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) depended on the availability of landing craft. The Navy intended to ship only 60 per month to the theater, as they had to be sent deckloaded on ships bound for Australia, as they were too large to fit into ships' holds. Trudeau proposed shipping them as components. In this way hundreds could be carried in a ship's hold. They could the assembled in Australia by the 411th Base Shop Battalion.  The decision to ship the 2nd Engineer Amphibian Brigade to Australia freed accommodation at Camp Carrabelle for the 3rd Engineer Amphibian Brigade, although it meant that yet another cycle of training would be conducted with inexperienced boat crews. On 27 November, MacArthur asked for two more brigades. He also recommended that their name be changed from \"amphibian\" to \"special\".{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=380\u2013386}}\n\nVoluntary enlistment in the Navy of men aged 18 to 37 ended on 5 December 1942; henceforth men in this age group could be obtained only through the draft.{{sfn|Furer|1959|p=279}} This cleared the way for absorption of the Army boat crews into the Navy. On 8 March 1943, the War and [[Navy Department]]s agreed that landing craft should be operated by the Navy, but exempted the three engineer special brigades allocated to SWPA. The 4th Engineer Special Brigade completed its training at Camp Edwards in August 1943, and then moved to Camp Gordon Johnston, where it conducted joint training with the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]]. After it departed for Australia in December 1943, the Engineer Amphibian Command provided instruction to replacement crews before being disbanded in April 1944.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=385\u2013389}}\n\n== 1st Engineer Special Brigade ==\nThe 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade was activated at Camp Edwards on 15 June 1942.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=365\u2013368}} Some 2,269 men were transferred from existing unit, the 37th Engineer Combat Regiment providing the nucleus of the boat regiment, and the 87th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion that of the shore regiment.{{sfn|Coll|Keith|Rosenthal|1958|pp=365\u2013368}} Brigadier General [[Henry C.

{"title_page": "Hegemonic masculinity", "text_new": "{{Technical|date=May 2017}}\n{{masculism sidebar}}\nIn [[gender studies]], '''hegemonic masculinity''' is part of [[Raewyn Connell|R.&nbsp;W. Connell]]'s [[Gender theory|gender order theory]], which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes [[Androcentrism|men's dominant]] position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.<ref name=Con2005/> Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant [[social role]]s over women, and other [[gender identities]], which are perceived as \"[[feminine]]\" in a given society.\n\nAs a [[sociology|sociological]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by [[Marxist theorist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a [[social group]] claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of [[social organization]] that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.<ref name=Don1993>{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&ndash;657 | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv| url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=artspapers }}</ref> However, many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity.\n\nProponents of the concept of hegemonic masculinity argue that it is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the [[Men's health|health of men]] and [[Women's health|women]], and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].<ref name=ConMes2005/> Critics argue that it is [[heteronormative]], is not self-reproducing, ignores positive aspects of masculinity, relies on a flawed underlying concept of masculinity, or is too ambiguous to have practical application.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]\nTerry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the \"real man\" is defined.

Stoller<ref name=Stoller1968>{{cite book | last = Stoller | first = Robert J. | title = Sex and gender: the development of masculinity and femininity | publisher = Karnac Books | location = London | year = 1984 |origyear = 1968 | isbn = 9780946439034 }}</ref> popularized the concept of [[gender identity]] and mapped its variation in boys' development.\n\n===Original framework===\nThe particular normative form of masculinity that is the most honoured way of being a man, which requires all other men to position themselves in relation to it, is known as hegemonic masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Originally, hegemonic masculinity was understood as the pattern of practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue. In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].<ref name=Don1993/> Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.<ref name=Con2005>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}</ref> Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up to them.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.<ref name=ConMes2005/> It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.<ref name=Con2005/> This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\n===Underlying concept of masculinity===\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,<ref name=Hearn>{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen,<ref name=Petersen>{{Cite journal | last = Petersen | first = Alan | title = Research on men and masculinities: Some implications of recent theory for future work | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&ndash;69 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X02250843 | date = July 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body.

Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.\n\n===Ambiguity and overlap===\nEarly criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Many men who hold great social power do not embody other aspects of ideal masculinity. Martin<ref name=Martin>{{Cite journal | last = Martin | first = Patricia Yancey | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman?

Wetherell and Edley<ref name=Weth>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wetherell | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Edley | first2 = Nigel | title = Negotiating hegemonic masculinity: Imaginary positions and psycho-discursive practices | journal = [[Feminism & Psychology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 335&ndash;356 | doi = 10.1177/0959353599009003012 | date = August 1999 | ref = harv| url = http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/4025/1/186657_4318%20Edley%20PostPrint.pdf }}</ref> contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead<ref name=White>{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}</ref> suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&ndash;304 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv}}</ref> has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\n===The problem of realness===\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Holter<ref name=Holter>{{cite book | last = Holter | first = \u00d8ystein Gullv\u00e5g | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}</ref> argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier<ref name=Collier>{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}</ref> remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional (see [[affect display]]), aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\n===The masculine subject===\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.<ref name=Weth/> To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.<ref name=White/> A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified [[essentialism]], wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&ndash;30 | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | ref = harv | hdl = 10453/44220 | hdl-access = free }} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]</ref>\n\n===The pattern of gender relations===\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.<ref name=Deme>{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&ndash;361 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\n==Reformulation==\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.<ref name=ConMes2005/> They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\n===Gender hierarchy===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences the other. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.<ref name=ConMes2005/> An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\n===Geography of masculinities===\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],<ref name=Hoop>{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}</ref> and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives.<ref name=Con2005/> Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.<ref name=ConMes2005/> The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\n===Social embodiment===\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. Marios Kostas writes in ''[[Gender and Education]]'' that \"hegemonic masculinity is also related to professional success in the labour market, which describes the social definition of tasks into as either 'men's work' or 'women\u2019s work' and the definition of some kinds of work as more masculine than others\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kostas |first=Marios |title=Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses |journal=Gender and Education |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=530\u2013548 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 |url=http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}</ref> The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.<ref name=Con2002>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | url = https://archive.org/details/gender0000conn | url-access = registration | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamics of masculinities===\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.<ref name=ConMes2005/> One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.<ref name=ConMes2005/> While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.<ref name=Deme/> This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.<ref name=Collier/> Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique.

The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy.

The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/> This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\"/> Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.<ref name=\"Spector-Mersel, G. 2006\"/> Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Adolescence===\nThe last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood.

In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality. This can lead to gay bashing and other forms of discrimination if young men seem not to perform the appropriate masculinity.\n\nThe male gender role is not biologically fixed, yet it is a result of the internalization of culturally defined gender norms and ideologies.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Oransky | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Celia | title = The development and validation of the meaning of adolescent masculinity scale | journal = [[Psychology of Men and Masculinity]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 57&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1037/a0013612 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> In this stage this is an important point as developmental psychologists recognize change in relations with parents, peers, and even their own self-identity.

Charlotte Hooper discusses how [[US foreign policy]], following the [[Vietnam War]], was seen as a way of bolstering America's manhood.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\">{{cite journal | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics | journal = [[Review of International Studies]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 475&ndash;480 | doi = 10.1017/s0260210599004751 | date = July 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref> It was believed that the Vietcong, often categorized \"as a bunch of women and children\", had humiliated and emasculated America.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> In order to regain its manhood \u2013 both domestically and internationally \u2013 America needed to develop a [[hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinized]] and aggressive breed of foreign policy. Hooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both \"the production and maintenance of masculinities.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity. Post-conflict Cyprus, presents one such example, as Stratis Andreas Efthymiou discusses, Greek Cypriot hegemonic masculinity is constructed into the post-conflict culture that supports the specific understanding of the national struggle for liberation and return <ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=Efthymiou|first=Stratis Andreas|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity After the Construction of the Border|date=2019|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14702-0_2|work=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|pages=23\u201353|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-030-14701-3|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>. Embodying bravery, determination, machismo, the subordination of women and a taste for guns were key aspects for achieving GC masculinity. In addition, proudly serving conscription in a difficult unit and showing attachment to the nationalist ideals were the pinnacle attributes of the post-war male<ref name=\":1\" />. In turn, hegemonic masculinity shaping and being shaped by nationalism and militarism places Greek Cypriot men who appeal to peace politics, cross the divide or interact with the \u2018other\u2019 at risk of failing the hegemonic model of masculinity. In other words, it is challenging for Greek Cypriot men to find a way to respectfully relate to their self, if they attempt to come closer to Turkish Cypriots, because of the nationalist militarist way that masculinity is shaped in Cyprus<ref name=\":1\" />. Therefore, masculinity is reproduced and adapted through a co-constitutive relationship with militarism and nationalism <ref>{{Cite book|last=Efthymiou, Stratis Andreas.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1106167576|title=Nationalism, Militarism and Masculinity in Post-Conflict Cyprus|isbn=978-3-030-14702-0|oclc=1106167576}}</ref>.\n\nHooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity \"symbolically, institutionally\", and culturally through body shape.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their \"enduring 'natural aggression'.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional \"exclusion of women from combat\", while furthering the myth \"that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a \"rite of passage\" for young men.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As such, \"war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities\" are formed and enshrined.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/>\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\",<ref name=\"Penn 2014\">{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\"<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.\n\n==Toxic masculinity==\n{{main|Toxic masculinity}}\nConnell argues that an important feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of \"toxic\" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''[[toxic masculinity]]'' to refer to stereotypically masculine [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s that can be expressed (see [[affect display]]) by boys and men, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the \"[[alpha male]]\").<ref name=\"Liu 2016\">{{cite news|url=http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083303/http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-date=12 October 2016|title=How Trump's 'Toxic Masculinity' Is Bad for Other Men|last=Liu|first=William Ming|date=14 April 2016|work=Motto (Time)|access-date=|url-status=live|location=New York}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAccording to Terry Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, \"such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination\".

Connell]]'s [[Gender theory|gender order theory]], which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes [[Androcentrism|men's dominant]] position in society and justifies the subordination of the common male population and women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.<ref name=Con2005/> Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant [[social role]]s over women, and other [[gender identities]], which are perceived as \"[[feminine]]\" in a given society.\n\nAs a [[sociology|sociological]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by [[Marxist theorist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a [[social group]] claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of [[social organization]] that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.<ref name=Don1993>{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&ndash;657 | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | ref = harv| url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=artspapers }}</ref> However, many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity.\n\nProponents of the concept of hegemonic masculinity argue that it is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the [[Men's health|health of men]] and [[Women's health|women]], and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].<ref name=ConMes2005/> Critics argue that it is [[heteronormative]], is not self-reproducing, ignores positive aspects of masculinity, relies on a flawed underlying concept of masculinity, or is too ambiguous to have practical application.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]\nTerry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the \"real man\" is defined. According to [R.&nbsp;W.] Connell, contemporary hegemonic masculinity is built on two legs, domination of women and a hierarchy of intermale dominance. It is also shaped to a significant extent by the stigmatization of homosexuality. Hegemonic masculinity is the stereotypic notion of masculinity that shapes the socialization and aspirations of young males. Today\u2019s hegemonic masculinity in the United States of America and Europe includes a high degree of ruthless competition, an inability to express emotions other than anger, an unwillingness to admit weakness or dependency, devaluation of women and all feminine attributes in men, homophobia, and so forth.{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}\n}}\n\n===History===\nConnell first proposed the concept of hegemonic masculinity in field reports from a study of [[social inequality]] in Australian high schools;<ref name=Kessler1982>{{cite book | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&nbsp;W. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Sandra J. | last3 = Ashenden | first3 = Dean | last4 = Dowsett | first4 = Gary | author-link1 = Raewyn Connell | title = Ockers & disco-maniacs: a discussion of sex, gender and secondary schooling | publisher = Inner City Education Centre | location = Stanmore, New South Wales | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780908274246 }}</ref> in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies;<ref name=Con1983>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Which way is up?

In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].<ref name=Don1993/> Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.<ref name=Con2005>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}</ref> Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"Con1987\" /> Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up to them.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.<ref name=ConMes2005/> It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.<ref name=Con2005/> This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\n==Criticisms==\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.<ref name=ConMes2005/>\n\n===Underlying concept of masculinity===\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,<ref name=Hearn>{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&ndash;72 | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen,<ref name=Petersen>{{Cite journal | last = Petersen | first = Alan | title = Research on men and masculinities: Some implications of recent theory for future work | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&ndash;69 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X02250843 | date = July 2003 | ref = harv }}</ref> the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body. Brod<ref name=Brod>{{cite book | last = Brod | first = Harry | author-link = Harry Brod | chapter = Some thoughts on some histories of some masculinities: Jews and other others | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXk5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA82 | editor-last1 = Brod | editor-first1 = Harry | editor-last2 = Kaufman | editor-first2 = Michael | editor-link1 = Harry Brod | editor-link2 = Michael Kaufman (author) | title = Theorizing masculinities | pages = [https://archive.org/details/theorizingmascul00brod/page/82 82&ndash;96] | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780803949041 | url = https://archive.org/details/theorizingmascul00brod/page/82 }}</ref> observes that there is a tendency in [[men's studies]] field to proceed as if women were not a relevant part of the analysis and therefore to analyse masculinities by looking only at men and relations among men. Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.\n\n===Ambiguity and overlap===\nEarly criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Many men who hold great social power do not embody other aspects of ideal masculinity. Martin<ref name=Martin>{{Cite journal | last = Martin | first = Patricia Yancey | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman? Reflections on Connell's ''Masculinities'' | journal = [[Gender & Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 472&ndash;474 | doi = 10.1177/089124398012004008 | date = August 1998 | ref = harv}}</ref> criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley<ref name=Weth>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wetherell | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Edley | first2 = Nigel | title = Negotiating hegemonic masculinity: Imaginary positions and psycho-discursive practices | journal = [[Feminism & Psychology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 335&ndash;356 | doi = 10.1177/0959353599009003012 | date = August 1999 | ref = harv| url = http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/4025/1/186657_4318%20Edley%20PostPrint.pdf }}</ref> contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead<ref name=White>{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}</ref> suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&ndash;304 | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv}}</ref> has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\n===The problem of realness===\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Holter<ref name=Holter>{{cite book | last = Holter | first = \u00d8ystein Gullv\u00e5g | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}</ref> argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier<ref name=Collier>{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}</ref> remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional (see [[affect display]]), aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\n===The masculine subject===\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.<ref name=ConMes2005/> Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.<ref name=Weth/> To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.<ref name=White/> A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified [[essentialism]], wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&ndash;30 | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | ref = harv | hdl = 10453/44220 | hdl-access = free }} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]</ref>\n\n===The pattern of gender relations===\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.<ref name=Deme>{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&ndash;361 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\n==Reformulation==\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.<ref name=ConMes2005/> They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\n===Gender hierarchy===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences the other. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.<ref name=ConMes2005/> An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\n===Geography of masculinities===\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],<ref name=Hoop>{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}</ref> and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives.<ref name=Con2005/> Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.<ref name=ConMes2005/> The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\n===Social embodiment===\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. Marios Kostas writes in ''[[Gender and Education]]'' that \"hegemonic masculinity is also related to professional success in the labour market, which describes the social definition of tasks into as either 'men's work' or 'women\u2019s work' and the definition of some kinds of work as more masculine than others\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kostas |first=Marios |title=Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses |journal=Gender and Education |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=530\u2013548 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 |url=http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}</ref> The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.<ref name=Con2002>{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | url = https://archive.org/details/gender0000conn | url-access = registration | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamics of masculinities===\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.<ref name=ConMes2005/> One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.<ref name=ConMes2005/> While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.<ref name=Deme/> This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.<ref name=Collier/> Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&ndash;111 | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Lifespan development==\n===Early childhood===\nChildren learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\">{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&ndash;307 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | ref = harv }}\n*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}</ref> This notion of \"doing\" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.<ref name=\"Bhana, D. 2009\">{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = \"Boys will be boys\": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&ndash;339 | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}</ref> The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity.

Gendered toys can play a large role in demonstrating the preferred actions and behaviour of young boys in [[early childhood]]. The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy.

[[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings.<ref name=\"Gelb, S. 1989\"/> A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents.

The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/> This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.<ref name=\"Oransky, M. 2009\"/> Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.<ref name=\"Spector-Mersel, G. 2006\"/> Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.<ref name=\"McGuffey, S. 2011\"/>\n\n===Adolescence===\nThe last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.<ref name=\"Laemmle, J. 2013\"/> [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less \"masculine\" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality.

Hooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both \"the production and maintenance of masculinities.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.\n\nHooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity \"symbolically, institutionally\", and culturally through body shape.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their \"enduring 'natural aggression'.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional \"exclusion of women from combat\", while furthering the myth \"that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity.\"<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a \"rite of passage\" for young men.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> As such, \"war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities\" are formed and enshrined.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/>\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch.<ref name=\"Hooper 1999 475\u2013480\"/> Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\",<ref name=\"Penn 2014\">{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\"<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,<ref name=\"Penn 2014\"/> which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.\n\n==Toxic masculinity==\n{{main|Toxic masculinity}}\nConnell argues that an important feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of \"toxic\" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''[[toxic masculinity]]'' to refer to stereotypically masculine [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s that can be expressed (see [[affect display]]) by boys and men, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the \"[[alpha male]]\").<ref name=\"Liu 2016\">{{cite news|url=http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012083303/http://motto.time.com/4273865/donald-trump-toxic-masculinity/|archive-date=12 October 2016|title=How Trump's 'Toxic Masculinity' Is Bad for Other Men|last=Liu|first=William Ming|date=14 April 2016|work=Motto (Time)|access-date=|url-status=live|location=New York}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nAccording to Terry Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, \"such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination\".

He clarifies that he has no interest in capturing humans, unlike Papyrus, who he describes as a \"human-hunting FANATIC.\" After helping the player hide from Papyrus, Sans follows his brother throughout most of the forest, commentating on his puzzles and even contributing a word search, much to Papyrus' dismay. As the story proceeds, Sans continues to be a regular source of comic relief, performing such antics as attempting to sell the player fried snow. Later in the game, Sans invites the player to go eat at a restaurant with him. As he talks, he explains how he befriended a woman behind the large door in Snowdin who shared an equal love for puns as he did. He explains how he made a promise not to kill any humans who come to the Underground and states if he didn't make that promise the player would have been dead where they stand.\n\nSans makes one more appearance in the \"Judgement Hall\", where he reveals the true meaning of the \"EXP\" and \"LOVE\" values that the player has accumulated through the game: 'Execution Points' and 'Level of Violence', respectively. He judges the player for how high their EXP and LOVE values are before disappearing and letting the player proceed to fight the king, Asgore. After the player defeats Asgore and leaves the Underground, Sans calls them to inform them of what occurred after their departure, having different dialogue depending on the player's actions in game. If the player finishes the game without killing any monsters, Sans appears after Asgore's defeat along with the other main characters, but his soul gets absorbed by [[Flowey]] along with most of the other monsters. He is restored after the player defeats Flowey and escapes the Underground with the rest of the monsters.\n\nIf the player opts to kill every monster they encounter, Sans' behavior will be very different. He threatens the player with a \"bad time\" if they proceed with their actions before the Papyrus boss fight. If the player ignores Sans' warning and continues slaughtering every monster they encounter, he eventually confronts the player in the Judgement Hall to prevent them from destroying the world, acting as the route's [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]. Sans puts up a fierce fight but is eventually slain by the player, allowing them to finish the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-the-kotaku-review-1739735669|title=Undertale: The Kotaku Review|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n===In ''Deltarune''===\nSans appears as a cameo in chapter one of ''[[Deltarune]]'', where he is found standing outside his shop.

He explains how he made a promise not to kill any humans who come to the Underground and states if he didn't make that promise the player would have been dead where they stand.\n\nSans makes one more appearance in the \"Judgement Hall\", where he reveals the true meaning of the \"EXP\" and \"LOVE\" values that the player has accumulated through the game: 'Execution Points' and 'Level of Violence', respectively. He judges the player for how high their EXP and LOVE values are before disappearing and letting the player proceed to fight the king, Asgore. After the player defeats Asgore and leaves the Underground, Sans calls them to inform them of what occurred after their departure, having different dialogue depending on the player's actions in game.\n\nIf the player finishes the game without killing any monsters, Sans appears after Asgore's defeat along with the other main characters, but his soul gets absorbed by [[Flowey]] along with most of the other monsters. He is restored after the player defeats Flowey and escapes the Underground with the rest of the monsters.\n\nIf the player opts to kill every monster they encounter, Sans' behavior will be very different. He threatens the player with a \"bad time\" if they proceed with their actions before the Papyrus boss fight. If the player ignores Sans' warning and continues slaughtering every monster they encounter, he eventually confronts the player in the Judgement Hall to prevent them from destroying the world, acting as the route's [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]. Sans puts up a fierce fight but is eventually slain by the player, allowing them to finish the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-the-kotaku-review-1739735669|title=Undertale: The Kotaku Review|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n===In ''Deltarune''===\nSans appears as a cameo in chapter one of ''[[Deltarune]]'', where he is found standing outside his shop. He informs the player he has already met their mother, [[Toriel]], and asks them if they would like to come over to his house and meet his brother.\n\n=== In other media ===\nIn ''[[Super Smash Bros.

All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1998. The sheriff and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, county commission or other county governing body. Communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.
