The last of the [[Littleton Baronets#The Littletons of Pillaton Hall|Littleton Baronets of Pillaton Hall]], he transferred the family seat from eponymous Pillaton to [[Teddesley Hall]], and died childless, leaving the estates to his great-nephew, Edward Walhouse, who became [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton]].\n\n==Background and early life==\nEdward Littleton, the 4th Baronet, was the son of Fisher Littleton' and Frances Whitehall.<ref>[http://histfam.familysearch.org/getperson.php?personID=I189562&tree=Nixon FamilySearch Community Trees: Sir Edward Littleton, Baronet 1725 \u2013 1812]</ref> Edward's year of birth is generally given as 1727, although occasionally as 1725. The later date seems more likely, as he was still considered a [[Minor (law)|minor]] as late as 1749.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53403 Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 5, East Cuttlestone Hundred \u2013 chapter 16, Penkridge \u2013 section 2, Manors.]</ref> His mother, Frances, was the daughter and coheir of James Whitehall of [[Pipe Ridware]], a village close to [[Rugeley]], Staffordshire. His father had not been a baronet or head of the family, and Edward's line of succession went back to [[Sir Edward Littleton, 2nd Baronet]].\n\nThe 3rd and 4th Baronets were cousins and both grandsons of the 2nd Baronet, who died in 1709. He had married twice and had at least 19 children. However, his eldest son, by his first marriage to Mary Wrottesley, naturally named Edward, predeceased him in 1706. The 3rd baronet was therefore a grandson, a son of the deceased Edward. The 3rd baronet died childless in 1742. This necessitated passing the title and estates to another line of descent from the second baronet. Fisher Littleton, his third son by his second wife, Joyce Littleton, was indubitably legitimate (unlike their earlier children), and had married relatively late in life. Fisher was actually a few years younger than his nephew, the Baronet. He had a young son, conveniently called Edward, who might succeed to the Littleton estates and titles.\n\nEdward's cousin, the 3rd Baronet, sent him to nearby [[Brewood Grammar School|Brewood School]], a clear sign that he regarded him as a likely heir. The school was at that time under the headship of the celebrated [[William Budworth]], who benefited considerably from the Baronet's generosity. During 1740 Fisher Littleton died and the young Edward, while still a schoolboy, inherited his father's land. In January 1742 he also inherited the much larger estates, as well as the titles, of his cousin, the 3rd Baronet.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/littleton-sir-edward-1725-1812 The History of Parliament: Members 1754\u20131790 \u2013 Littleton, Sir Edward, 4th Bt.

In that year he completed his family's dominance of the [[Penkridge]] area by buying the [[manor]] of Penkridge itself.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53403 Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 5, East Cuttlestone Hundred \u2013 chapter 16, Penkridge \u2013 section 2, Manors.]</ref> This had been divided into two by [[Henry de Loundres]], [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Dublin]] and dean of Penkridge in the 13th century. The smaller part, conferred on the Collegiate Church of St. Michael, Penkridge, and known as the [[deanery]] manor, had been leased to the Littletons even before the Reformation. The church lost it in the Dissolution of [[Chantry|Chantries]] in 1547, and the Littletons were able to purchase it in the 1580s. The larger part of the manor, conferred on [[Laity|lay]] landowners, had belonged to heads of the Greville family, later [[Baron Brooke|Barons Brooke]], since the early 16th century. However, the Grevilles had larger interests in Warwickshire, not least Warwick Castle itself. [[Francis Greville, 1st Earl of Warwick|Francis Greville]], who had recently been made [[Earl Brooke]] and was soon to become [[Earl of Warwick]], decided to sell Penkridge to Littleton, giving the family not only a larger but a more compact and manageable block of estates.\n\nOn 10 May 1752 Littleton married '''Frances Horton''', daughter of Christopher Horton of [[Catton Hall]], near [[Walton-on-Trent]], Derbyshire. The Hortons had just had their medieval manor house demolished to make way for a large [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building more in keeping with the times. [[Pillaton Hall]] was a 16th-century structure, originally conceived as simply a manor house for the small Littleton estate of Pillaton and Otherton. Littleton soon began work on a new and more impressive seat for the family. It was said that two large hoards of coins were discovered in 1742 and 1749 behind panels at Pillaton Hall, which raised the sum of \u00a315,000 on sale, and thus defrayed the costs of the new hall.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53410#s2 VCH Staffordshire: Volume 5: 23: s.2: The Hay]</ref>\n\n[[Teddesley Hall]] was built north-west of Penkridge, on Teddesley Hay. The Hay had been acquired about two centuries earlier, when the [[Tudor dynasty]] disposed of the old [[royal forest]] lands. It was [[heath]] and [[bog]] land, difficult to cultivate but potentially attractive. There the Littletons had Teddesley Lodge, a moated house that had accommodated junior members of the family, including an earlier Fisher Littleton, who had helped recover the family property after the [[English Civil War]].\n\nTeddesley Hall was constructed on a new site, about 200 metres from the Lodge. It was large but austere, a three-storied, square, brick structure, with seven windows on the upper storeys on all four faces. The main building was linked by curved screen walls to flanking ranges, one housing stables, the other kitchens, stores and servants' rooms. It was to remain the family seat until the 20th century, when it was demolished.\n\nLittleton now lived the life of a country gentleman, participating in county life to the full. He actively improved Teddesley Park, the area around his new home, creating gardens and hundreds of acres of grazing land beyond them. He did not seek to cultivate the land but developed his own strain of cattle to suit the conditions. He and his tenants also created an improved breed of sheep by crossing the hornless sheep of [[Cannock Chase]] with Ross rams.\n\nIn 1762-3 he was [[High Sheriff of Staffordshire]], an onerous and expensive post that was not universally welcomed but reflected his standing. In 1781 his wife Frances died. They had no children and he never remarried.\n\n==Political career==\nLittleton was returned unopposed, along with [[Sir John Wrottesley, 8th Baronet]], as MP for [[Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Staffordshire]] on 8 April 1784. The seat was dominated at this time by the Leveson-Gower family of [[Trentham Hall]]. They were traditionally [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] but [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford]] had accepted posts in [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] ministries. By general agreement among the county [[landed gentry]], one candidate should represent the Leveson Gower interest: this was Wrottesley, who had served in the [[American Revolutionary War]], but returned home to oppose the running of it \u2013 essentially Gower's own position. The second seat was for a country member: a gentlemen acceptable to the local landowning interest but essentially uncommitted to party. This was Littleton.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/constituencies/staffordshire The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1754\u20131790 \u2013 Staffordshire (Author: John Brooke])</ref> In fact, the [[Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge (second creation)|Earl of Uxbridge]] had designs on the seat forhis son, [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Lord Paget]], who was still only 16 years old. By proposing Littleton, now in his late 50s, he hoped the seat might become vacant at the next election. In reality, Littleton survived for a further 28 years, holding his seat until his death.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/littleton-sir-edward-1727-1812 The History of Parliament: Members 1790\u20131820 \u2013 Littleton, Sir Edward, 4th Bt. (Author: R. G. Thorne)]</ref> Wrottesley, however, died in 1787 and was replaced by [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|Lord Gower]], the Marquess's son. Gower was to remain an MP for Staffordshire until 1799, when his half-brother [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower]] took over, holding the seat until 1815. Thus Littleton's colleagues at Westminster were much grander than himself for most of his political career, and in his last years he was largely overawed by them. Because of the tacit agreement about the distribution of seats, all Littleton's elections were uncontested.\n\n<gallery caption=\"The Staffordshire landowning establishment\">\nFile:1stMarquessOfStafford.jpg |Granville Leveson-Gower, The Earl Gower (1721\u20131803) in 1784, later 1st Marquess of Stafford. Head of a traditionally Whig family based at [[Trentham Hall]], he joined the Tory ministry of [[Frederick North, Lord North]] in the 1770s. His acquiescence was essential for [[Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Staffordshire]] MPs. He put in his nephew, Wrottesley, alongside Littleton.\nFile:Henry William Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey by William Salter.jpg|Henry William Paget, son of the [[Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge (second creation)|Earl of Uxbridge]]. The Pagets were close neighbours of Littleton, with their Staffordshire seat at [[Beaudesert (house)|Beaudesert]]. Uxbridge approved Littleton's candidature, intending to keep the seat warm for Lord Paget. Littleton's longevity frustrated their plan, and Paget went on to win great fame as a soldier.\nFile:George Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland by Thomas Phillips.jpg|Lord Gower (1758\u20131833), Littleton's colleague as Staffordshire MP 1787\u20131799, pictured in later life as Duke of Sutherland. As the son of the 1st Marquess of Stafford, he was well placed to interpret and police the family's interests. Later his role in the [[Highland Clearances]] was to be controversial.\nFile:Thomas Lawrence, Portrait of Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, later 1st Earl Granville (c. 1804\u20131809).jpg|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower (1773\u20131846), Lord Gower's half-brother and Littleton's colleague as Staffordshire MP from 1799. He had considerably more liberal views and helped tip the family into opposition to [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Later he was to become a prominent Whig reformer.\n</gallery>\n\nLittleton was never a very active MP. He spoke only once in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]], shortly after he was first elected, against the [[brick tax]]. His party loyalties were vague. Often considered a Whig, he nevertheless voted most often with the Tory ministries that dominated the age, although this was not uncommon in times of war.  With the collapse of the [[Rockingham Whigs]], the Whig party in Parliament became fragmented and presented little opposition to the broadly Tory ministries of [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Littleton voted with Pitt's government on most issues. Whigs were distinguished at least as much by their support of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] against his father, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], as with any specific cause. Littleton did not support the Prince and the [[Foxite]] Whigs in the [[George IV of the United Kingdom#Regency crisis of 1788|Regency crisis of 1788]] but he did vote for their proposal to settle the Prince's debts in 1795. In 1791 he opposed the repeal of the [[Test Act]] in Scotland, an early move towards [[civil rights]] for [[Roman Catholics]], a cause that was to become an identifying mark of liberals in both Whig and Tory parties. On the other hand, in the very same year, he voted with the minority for [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of the slave trade]].\n\nOne problem faced by Littleton, very much a countryman, was his lack of metropolitan contacts and polish. In 1795, the cultivated, liberal Tory [[George Canning]] attended a dinner given by Littleton and wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Poor Sir Ed, who is a [[quiz#Etymology|quiz]] of the first magnitude, and who I believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during the whole of the entertainment. He informed us at the outset that he had been able to get but two bottles of champagne, and he seemed to take it much to heart when anybody showed a disposition to drink other wine in a much larger proportion.</blockquote>\n\nIn his later years, Littleton showed considerably more dissent from the ministerial position on key issues. This was probably because the Leveson Gowers were increasingly opposed to Pitt, while his colleague from 1799, [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower]] was personally sympathetic to the Whigs. From 1801 to 1804, Pitt's place as prime minister was taken by [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]], introduced as a caretaker for Pitt, but on increasingly strained terms with his former friend. This gave Pitt's opponents in both parties an opportunity to undermine him. The Leveson Gowers induced Littleton to join the opposition to Pitt's [[Additional Forces Act|Additional Forces Bill]] of 1803. The measure, to create a large Reserve Army, was highly controversial and its course through Parliament tortuous. Littleton voted with the minority against its final form on 11 June 1804. This was his last known vote. Thereafter he was considered a doubtful supporter of Tory ministries, but the Whigs too were doubtful of his support.\n\nFor much of the rest of his tenure of the Staffordshire seat, Littleton was either in default or on sick leave. He was considered still 'friendly' to the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, but was unable to vote for it. On his death in 1812, his nephew [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton|Edward Walhouse]] replaced him as MP, soon after changing his name to Littleton. He was a very different MP from the 4th Baronet: urbane, studious, a master of political detail and a determined debater, he first joined the [[Canningite]] Tories, but later became a Whig.\n\n==Family==\nLittleton married Frances Horton in 1752. She died childless in 1781. As a result, there was no heir to the baronetcy, which therefore lapsed.\n\nLittleton's sister, also called Frances, had married Moreton Walhouse, a member of a business dynasty with valuable investments in the [[Walsall]] area. Their grandson, [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton|Edward Walhouse]] was made heir to the Littleton estates, on condition that he change his name to Littleton, which he subsequently did. Heir to two fortunes, and thus a very rich man, he also became by far the most illustrious of the Littleton family politically, an important reformer and an active parliamentarian in both Houses for over fifty years, he served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] in the 1830s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Penkridge]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Littleton, Edward}}\n[[Category:1727 births]]\n[[Category:1812 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England]]\n[[Category:English landowners]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834)]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1801\u20131802]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1802\u20131806]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1806\u20131807]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1807\u20131812]]\n[[Category:Whig (British political party) MPs]]\n[[Category:People from Penkridge]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Penkridge St Michael - Sit Edward Littleton 1812 monument.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Sir Edward Littleton, the 4th and last baronet, in St Michael's church, [[Penkridge]].

Littleton's longevity frustrated their plan, and Paget went on to win great fame as a soldier.\nFile:George Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland by Thomas Phillips.jpg|Lord Gower (1758\u20131833), Littleton's colleague as Staffordshire MP 1787-1799, pictured in later life as Duke of Sutherland. As the son of the 1st Marquess of Stafford, he was well placed to interpret and police the family's interests. Later his role in the [[Highland Clearances]] was to be controversial.\nFile:Thomas Lawrence, Portrait of Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, later 1st Earl Granville (c. 1804\u20131809).jpg|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower (1773\u20131846), Lord Gower's half-brother and Littleton's colleague as Staffordshire MP from 1799. He had considerably more liberal views and helped tip the family into opposition to [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Later he was to become a prominent Whig reformer.\n</gallery>\n\nLittleton was never a very active MP. He spoke only once in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]], shortly after he was first elected, against the [[brick tax]]. His party loyalties were vague. Often considered a Whig, he nevertheless voted most often with the Tory ministries that dominated the age, although this was not uncommon in times of war.  With the collapse of the [[Rockingham Whigs]], the Whig party in Parliament became fragmented and presented little opposition to the broadly Tory ministries of [[William Pitt the Younger]]. Littleton voted with Pitt's government on most issues. Whigs were distinguished at least as much by their support of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] against his father, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], as with any specific cause. Littleton did not support the Prince and the [[Foxite]] Whigs in the [[George IV of the United Kingdom#Regency crisis of 1788|Regency crisis of 1788]] but he did vote for their proposal to settle the Prince's debts in 1795. In 1791 he opposed the repeal of the [[Test Act]] in Scotland, an early move towards [[civil rights]] for [[Roman Catholics]], a cause that was to become an identifying mark of liberals in both Whig and Tory parties. On the other hand, in the very same year, he voted with the minority for [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of the slave trade]].\n\nOne problem faced by Littleton, very much a countryman, was his lack of metropolitan contacts and polish. In 1795, the cultivated, liberal Tory [[George Canning]] attended a dinner given by Littleton and wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Poor Sir Ed, who is a [[quiz#Etymology|quiz]] of the first magnitude, and who I believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during the whole of the entertainment. He informed us at the outset that he had been able to get but two bottles of champagne, and he seemed to take it much to heart when anybody showed a disposition to drink other wine in a much larger proportion.</blockquote>\n\nIn his later years, Littleton showed considerably more dissent from the ministerial position on key issues. This was probably because the Leveson Gowers were increasingly opposed to Pitt, while his colleague from 1799, [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower]] was personally sympathetic to the Whigs. From 1801 to 1804, Pitt's place as prime minister was taken by [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]], introduced as a caretaker for Pitt, but on increasingly strained terms with his former friend. This gave Pitt's opponents in both parties an opportunity to undermine him. The Leveson Gowers induced Littleton to join the opposition to Pitt's [[Additional Forces Act|Additional Forces Bill]] of 1803. The measure, to create a large Reserve Army, was highly controversial and its course through Parliament tortuous. Littleton voted with the minority against its final form on 11 June 1804. This was his last known vote. Thereafter he was considered a doubtful supporter of Tory ministries, but the Whigs too were doubtful of his support.\n\nFor much of the rest of his tenure of the Staffordshire seat, Littleton was either in default or on sick leave. He was considered still 'friendly' to the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, but was unable to vote for it. On his death in 1812, his nephew [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton|Edward Walhouse]] replaced him as MP, soon after changing his name to Littleton. He was a very different MP from the 4th Baronet: urbane, studious, a master of political detail and a determined debater, he first joined the [[Canningite]] Tories, but later became a Whig.\n\n==Family==\nLittleton married Frances Horton in 1752. She died childless in 1781. As a result, there was no heir to the baronetcy, which therefore lapsed.\n\nLittleton's sister, also called Frances, had married Moreton Walhouse, a member of a business dynasty with valuable investments in the [[Walsall]] area. Their grandson, [[Edward Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton|Edward Walhouse]] was made heir to the Littleton estates, on condition that he change his name to Littleton, which he subsequently did. Heir to two fortunes, and thus a very rich man, he also became by far the most illustrious of the Littleton family politically, an important reformer and an active parliamentarian in both Houses for over fifty years, he served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] in the 1830s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Penkridge]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Littleton, Edward}}\n[[Category:1727 births]]\n[[Category:1812 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England]]\n[[Category:English landowners]]\n[[Category:High Sheriffs of Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834)]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1801\u20131802]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1802\u20131806]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1806\u20131807]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1807\u20131812]]\n[[Category:Whig (British political party) MPs]]\n[[Category:People from Penkridge]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePolitical career:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1787-1799 \u2192 1787\u20131799", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Edward_Littleton,_4th_Baronet"}

Knight (1840)==\nHe made his will on 3 June 1814, leaving the property to his brother, [[Thomas Andrew Knight]] and in [[tail male]] to his male descendants. But if there were none, the property was to pass to the \"next descendant in the direct male line of my late grandfather, Richard Knight of Downton\". However, he also stated:<br />\n:\"I trust to the liberality of my successors to reward any others of my old servants and tenants according to their deserts, and to their justice in continuing the estates in the male succession, according to the will of the founder of the family, my above-named grandfather\".\nWere it not for these last words, his will appeared to have created a [[trust (law)|trust]], which would have precluded Charlotte from inheriting, as her father Thomas Knight died [[Intestacy|intestate]] and without male progeny, having been  pre-deceased by his only son. One of his male Knight cousins (namely [[John Knight (Exmoor pioneer)|John Knight]] (1765-1850) of Lea Castle, [[Wolverley]], of 52 Portland Place and of [[Simonsbath House]], [[Exmoor]], [[Somerset]]) challenged Charlotte's right as a female to inherit under the terms of Payne's will, which resulted in the famous 1840 lawsuit [[Knight v Knight]]. The judge decided that due to these last words in Payne's will, it had not been his intention to create a trust and therefore Thomas had inherited from him an absolute title in his property, which thus passed by law to his daughter.\n\n==Books==\n[[File:Discourse on the worship of Priapus and its connection with the mystic theology of the ancients 4 figs.jpg|thumb|Four figures from ''Discourse on the worship of Priapus and its connection with the mystic theology of the ancients'' as republished by [[George Witt (collector)|George Witt]] in 1865]]\nNotoriously, Knight's first book, ''The Worship of [[Priapus]]'', sought to recover the importance of ancient phallic cults. Knight's apparent preference for ancient sacred [[eroticism]] over [[Judeo-Christian]] [[puritan]]ism led to many attacks on him as an infidel and as a scholarly apologist for libertinism. This ensured the persistent distrust of the religious establishment. The central claim of ''The Worship of Priapus'' was that an international religious impulse to worship 'the generative principle' was articulated through genital imagery, and that this imagery has persisted into the modern age.

Knight's views on the [[aesthetics]] of the picturesque are also formed in engagement with [[Edmund Burke]]'s emphasis on the importance of sensation, which Knight partly rejects in favour of a modified [[associationism]]. The philosophical basis of Knight's theories have implications for his account of the relationship between the 'beautiful' and the 'picturesque'. For Knight, aesthetic concepts cannot be formed directly from optical sensations, because these must be interpreted within the mind before they can be recognised as beautiful. Thus a [[Classical architecture]] [[Roman temple]] is beautiful because of the proportions of its parts, but these proportions can never be perceived directly by the senses, which will simply encounter a mass of confused impressions. 'Beauty' is thus a product of internal mental acts. It is therefore proper to speak of moral, mathematical and other non-sensuous forms of beauty, contrary to Burke, [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] and others who claimed such usages were metaphorical. In all cases 'the particular object [e.g. proportion] is an abstract idea.\u2019\n\n==Visual arts==\nFor Knight \"picturesque\" means simply \"after the manner of painting\", a point which is important to his further discussion of sensation, which in Knight's view is central to the understanding of painting and music which are \"addressed to the organs of sight and hearing\", while poetry and sculpture appeal \"entirely to the imagination and passions.\" The latter must be understood in terms of associations of ideas, while the former rely on the \"irritation\" or friction of sensitive parts of the body. Knight's view was that artists should seek to reproduce primal visual sensations, not the mental interpretative processes which give rise to abstract ideas.\n\nFor Knight, colour is experienced directly as pleasurable sensation. A pure blue is not pleasurable because it reminds us of clear skies, as Price supposed, but because of the experience itself. Interpretation of impressions follows chains of association following from this primal sensory experience. However, the pleasures of sense may be 'modified by habit', so that the pure stimulus of colour may be experienced as pleasurable when 'under the influence of mind' which perceives its meaningful use within a painting. Excess of pure colour is painful, like any other sensory excess. Variety and combination of colours is most pleasurable.\n\nKnight makes much of the need to fragment an image into tonal and colouristic \"masses\", a view that has been claimed to anticipate the late work of [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], or even [[Impressionism]]. However, it most directly justifies the practices of contemporary painters of picturesque landscapes, such as [[Girtin]], whose stippling effects are comparable to Knight's account of pleasing colour combinations.  Knight commissioned landscape artist, [[Thomas Hearne (1744-1817)|Thomas Hearne]] to produce several drawings of the grounds of his home, [[Downton Castle]] in Herefordshire.<ref>[[V&A]]: ''[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O74197/watercolour-the-river-teme-at-downton/ The River Teme at Downton, Herefordshire]''</ref>\n\nOn sculpture \u2013 typically for him, colourless form \u2013 generates in the mind the idea of shape which we must conceptualise, as with 'proportion'.  The literary arts, like sculpture, deal with thoughts and emotions, though in a more complex form. Knight's account of these arts therefore falls under the heading of 'association of ideas'. Here Knight shows the influence of the contemporary cult of sensibility, arguing that these arts engage our sympathies, and in so doing demonstrate the inadequacy of 'rules and systems' in both morality and aesthetics. These teach 'men to work by rule, instead of by feeling and observation.' Rule-based knowledge of wrong cannot prevent wrongdoing, because it is thought not felt. Therefore, 'it is impossible that tragedy should exhibit examples of pure and strict morality, without becoming dull and uninteresting.\u2019\n\nKnight's discussion of 'the passions' engages with both Classical and recent theorisations of sentiments. His discussion of the sublime is directed against Burke's emphasis on feelings of terror and powerlessness. Knight defends [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]'s original account of sublimity, which he summarises as the 'energetic exertion of great and commanding power.' Again he intertwines social and aesthetic reasoning, asserting that the power of a tyrant cannot be sublime if the tyrant inspires fear by mere arbitrary whim, like [[Nero]]. However, it may be sublime if his tyranny, like [[Napoleon]]'s, derives from the exercise of immense personal capacities. A Nero may be feared, but would also be despised. A Napoleon may be hated, but will nevertheless inspire awe. In art, the mind experiences the sublime as it experiences the exercise of its own powers, or sympathises with the exercises of the powers of others. Fear itself can never engender the sublime.\n\nKnight's emphasis on the roles of sensation and of emotion were constitutive of later [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] aesthetic thinking, as was his vexed struggle with the relation between moral feeling and sensuous pleasure. Though some contemporaries condemned the basis of his thought as an aestheticised libertinism, or devotion to physical sensation, they influenced [[John Ruskin]]'s attempts to theorise the Romantic aesthetic of Turner, and to integrate political and pictorial values.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Knight v Knight]]'' (1840) 3 Beav 148\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Rayment-hc|date=March 2012}}\n* George Sebastian Rousseau, Roy Porter, ''Sexual underworlds of the Enlightenment'', Manchester University Press ND, 1987, {{ISBN|0-7190-1961-3}}, pp.&nbsp;101\u2013155\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first1=Alicia |last1=Amherst |title=A History of Gardening in England |edition=3rd |year=2006 |origyear=1910 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Gardening_in_England.html?id=Fk4KTrvZ8nMC |location= Whitefish, Montana|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]}}\n*{{cite book |first1=Sir F.

He was a collector of ancient [[bronze]]s and [[coin]]s, and an author of numerous books and articles on ancient sculpture, coins and other artefacts.

Knight (1840)==\nHe made his will on 3 June 1814, leaving the property to his brother, [[Thomas Andrew Knight]] and in [[tail male]] to his male descendants. But if there were none, the property was to pass to the \"next descendant in the direct male line of my late grandfather, Richard Knight of Downton\". However, he also stated:<br />\n:\"I trust to the liberality of my successors to reward any others of my old servants and tenants according to their deserts, and to their justice in continuing the estates in the male succession, according to the will of the founder of the family, my above-named grandfather\".\nWere it not for these last words, his will appeared to have created a [[trust (law)|trust]], which would have precluded Charlotte from inheriting, as her father Thomas Knight died [[Intestacy|intestate]] and without male progeny, having been  pre-deceased by his only son. One of his male Knight cousins (namely [[John Knight (Exmoor pioneer)|John Knight]] (1765-1850) of Lea Castle, [[Wolverley]], of 52 Portland Place and of [[Simonsbath House]], [[Exmoor]], [[Somerset]]) challenged Charlotte's right as a female to inherit under the terms of Payne's will, which resulted in the famous 1840 law suit [[Knight v Knight]]. The judge decided that due to these last words in Payne's will, it had not been his intention to create a trust and therefore Thomas had inherited from him an absolute title in his property, which thus passed by law to his daughter.\n\n==Books==\n[[File:Discourse on the worship of Priapus and its connection with the mystic theology of the ancients 4 figs.jpg|thumb|Four figures from ''Discourse on the worship of Priapus and its connection with the mystic theology of the ancients'' as republished by [[George Witt (collector)|George Witt]] in 1865]]\nNotoriously, Knight's first book, ''The Worship of [[Priapus]]'', sought to recover the importance of ancient phallic cults.

It topped the album charts in the UK, Canada and [[Billboard 200|US]], and was listed at No. 40 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Soul Albums chart]].

They began to work out songs early in 1969, and in February and March the group was in London at [[Morgan Studios]], preparing for the beginnings of basic tracks for their album, although the first few almost-finished songs didn't show up until they were at [[Olympic Studios]] in April and May under the direction of producer [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]].<ref name=black>{{cite magazine|title=Born Under A Bad Sign|first=Johnny|last=Black|work=Mojo|date=June 1996|pp=47\u201352|url=http://www.gingerbaker.com/bands/blind-faith.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe recording of their album was interrupted by a tour of Scandinavia, then a US tour from 11 July (Newport) to 24 August (Hawaii), supported by [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Taste (band)|Taste]] and [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]]. Although a chart topper, the LP was recorded hurriedly and side two consisted of just two songs, one of them a 15-minute jam entitled \"Do What You Like\".

The spaceship would be the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge]] and the girl, the fruit of the tree of life.\n\nThe spaceship could be made by [[Mick Milligan]], a jeweller at the [[Royal College of Art]]. The girl was another matter. If she were too old it would be [[Pin-up model|cheesecake]], too young and it would be nothing.

The name was instead printed on the wrapper, when the wrapper came off, so did the type.\" This had been done previously for several other albums.\n\nIn America, [[Atco Records]] made a cover based on elements from a flyer for the band's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] concert of 7 June 1969 in London.\n\n== Release history ==\nThe album was released on vinyl in 1969 on [[Polydor Records]] in the UK and Europe, and on Atco Records in the US.

It topped the album charts in the UK, Canada and [[Billboard 200|US]], and was listed at No. 40 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Soul Albums chart]]. It has been certified [[platinum album|platinum]] by the [[RIAA]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe band contained two-thirds of the popular [[power trio]] [[Cream (band)|Cream]], in [[Ginger Baker]] and [[Eric Clapton]], working in collaboration with British star [[Steve Winwood]] of [[the Spencer Davis Group]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], along with [[Ric Grech]] of [[Family (band)|Family]]. They began to work out songs early in 1969, and in February and March the group was in London at [[Morgan Studios]], preparing for the beginnings of basic tracks for their album, although the first few almost-finished songs didn't show up until they were at [[Olympic Studios]] in April and May under the direction of producer [[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]].<ref name=black>{{cite magazine|title=Born Under A Bad Sign|first=Johnny|last=Black|work=Mojo|date=June 1996|pp=47\u201352|url=http://www.gingerbaker.com/bands/blind-faith.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe recording of their album was interrupted by a tour of Scandinavia, then a US tour from 11 July (Newport) to 24 August (Hawaii), supported by [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Taste (band)|Taste]] and [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]]. Although a chart topper, the LP was recorded hurriedly and side two consisted of just two songs, one of them a 15-minute jam entitled \"Do What You Like\". Nevertheless the band was able to produce two hits, Winwood's \"Can't Find My Way Home\" and Clapton's \"Presence of the Lord\".<ref name=black/><ref>{{cite book|last=Welch|first=Chris|title=Clapton - Updated Edition: The Ultimate Illustrated History|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=2016|isbn= 978-0-760-35019-5|pp=132\u2013141}}</ref>\n\n== Album cover controversy ==\nThe cover featured a topless pubescent girl holding what appears to be the [[hood ornament]] of a [[Chevrolet Bel Air]], which some perceived as phallic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=There's a Riot Going On: Revolutionaries, Rock Stars, and the Rise and Fall of the '60s|publisher=Canongate Books|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/theresriotgoingo00dogg/page/280 280\u2013281]|isbn=1-84767-180-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/theresriotgoingo00dogg/page/280}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|title=The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music|year=1992|pages=268|isbn=0-85112-939-0}}</ref> The American record company issued it with an alternative cover showing a photograph of the band on the front as well as the original cover.\n\nThe cover art was created by photographer [[Bob Seidemann]], a friend and former flatmate of Clapton's who is primarily known for his photos of [[Janis Joplin]] and the [[Grateful Dead]]. In the mid-1990s, in an advertising circular intended to help sell [[lithography|lithographic]] reprints of the famous album cover, he explained his thinking behind the image.\n\n{{quote|I could not get my hands on the image until out of the mist a concept began to emerge. To symbolize the achievement of human creativity and its expression through technology a spaceship was the material object. To carry this new spore into the universe, innocence would be the ideal bearer, a young girl, a girl as young as Shakespeare's [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. The spaceship would be the fruit of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge]] and the girl, the fruit of the tree of life.\n\nThe spaceship could be made by [[Mick Milligan]], a jeweller at the [[Royal College of Art]]. The girl was another matter. If she were too old it would be [[Pin-up model|cheesecake]], too young and it would be nothing. The beginning of the transition from girl to woman, that is what I was after. That temporal point, that singular flare of radiant innocence.

Instead, the model he used was her younger sister Mariora Goschen, who was reported to be 11 years old.<ref name=bestcovers /> Mariora initially requested a horse as a fee but was instead paid \u00a340.<ref name=bestcovers>{{cite book|title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves|last=Thorgerson|first= Storm|author2=Powell, Aubrey|year=1999|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=0-7513-0706-8|pages=29}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tonybarrell.com/cover-stories/ Barrell, Tony, \"Cover Stories\", ''Sunday Times'' (11 November 2007)]</ref>\n\nThe image, titled \"Blind Faith\" by Seidemann, became the inspiration for the name of the band itself, which had been unnamed when the artwork was commissioned. According to Seidemann: \"It was Eric who elected to not print the name of the band on the cover. The name was instead printed on the wrapper, when the wrapper came off, so did the type.\" This had been done previously for several other albums.\n\nIn America, [[Atco Records]] made a cover based on elements from a flyer for the band's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] concert of 7 June 1969 in London.\n\n== Release history ==\nThe album was released on vinyl in 1969 on [[Polydor Records]] in the UK and Europe, and on Atco Records in the US. Polydor released a [[compact disc]] in 1986, adding two previously unreleased tracks, \"Exchange and Mart\" and \"Spending All My Days\", recorded by Ric Grech for an unfinished solo album, supported by [[George Harrison]], [[Denny Laine]], and [[Trevor Burton]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjY3kg2umEQC&pg=PA43|page=43|title=The Music of George Harrison: While My Guitar Gently Weeps|author=Simon Leng|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|date= 2003}}</ref>\n\nAn expanded edition of the album was released on 9 January 2001, with previously unreleased tracks and 'jams' included. The studio electric version of \"Sleeping in the Ground\" had previously been released on the four-disc boxed set for Clapton, ''[[Crossroads (Eric Clapton album)|Crossroads]]'' (released 1988, recorded 1963\u20131987, including several previously unreleased live or alternate studio recordings). The bonus disc of jams does not include bassist Grech, who had yet to join the band, but includes a guest percussionist, Guy Warner. Two live tracks from the [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|1969 Hyde Park concert]] not included here, \"Sleeping in the Ground\" and a cover of \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", are also available on Winwood's four-disc retrospective ''[[The Finer Things]]''.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1=[[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/blind-faith-mw0000197076|title=Blind Faith \u2013 Blind Faith &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards &#124; AllMusic|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n|rev3 = ''[[The Great Rock Discography]]''\n|rev3Score = 7/10<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n|rev4 = ''[[Louder Sound|Louder]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Paul|date=16 August 2018|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/blind-faith-super-album-from-supergroup|title=Blind Faith: Blind Faith album review|website=[[Louder Sound|Louder]]|accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n|rev5=''[[MusicHound|MusicHound Rock]]''\n|rev5Score=3.5/5<ref name=\"AM\"/>\n| rev6 = [[Music Story]]\n| rev6Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AM2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/album/A1228.htm|title=Blind Faith|publisher=acclaimedmusic.net|accessdate=1 July 2018}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|title=Blind Faith|date=April 2001|page=116}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM2\"/>\n| rev9 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev9Score = B<ref name=\"CG\"/>\n}}\nCommercially, the album charted at number one in both the US<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6976282/blind-faith/chart|title=Blind Faith \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> and the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2618/blind-faith/|title=BLIND FAITH \u2013 full Official Chart History \u2013 Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nCritically, ''Blind Faith'' was met with a mixed response.

He was educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and was awarded BA in 1750.  He joined the army and was lieutenant in the [[5th Foot]] in 1754, captain in 1756 and major in 1762. He served as lieutenant colonel and then colonel in the Portuguese army. He then went to Paris, and attached himself to [[Stephen Fox, 2nd Baron Holland|Stephen Fox]] the brother of Charles James Fox. He soon became acquainted with [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]], then ambassador, and  became his master of the horse and gradually his intimate dependant. He retired from the army in 1768. He married Elizabeth Legge, daughter of George, Viscount Lewisham on  1 August 1771.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/keene-whitshed-1731-1822 | title=KEENE, Whitshed (c.1731-1822), of Hawthorn Hill, Berks.| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1754-1790) | accessdate = 21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nKeene was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Wareham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wareham]] at a by-election in November 1768. In 1772 he became Secretary to the Lord Chamberlain, a post he held until March 1782.  In 1774, when he was appointed to the [[Board of Trade]], he was required to undergo re-election but having resigned at Wareham, he was then re-elected at  [[Ludgershall (UK Parliament constituency)|Ludgershall]]  where he sat for 6 months. He  seems never to have spoken in the Parliament of 1768\u20131774.<ref name = HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1774 British general election|1774 general election]] Keene was returned unopposed at [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomery]] on the Powis interest He was returned there for a total of 44 years by three successive members of the Powis-Clive family. In June 1777 he was removed from the Board of Trade to succeed Thomas Worsley as surveyor general at the [[Office of Works|Board of Works]]. It was believed that Worsley could scarcely outlive the day, but he lived on until December 1778. Keene took up hs post in January 1779 and was paid \u00a32,000 from secret service funds for his loss of salary etc. of the Board of Trade and election expenses.\n\nIn [[1780 British general election|1780]] an opposition to Keene was intended at Montgomery but  the neighbouring country gentleman who was proposed never materialized, and Keene's election was once more unopposed. He made his first speech on record on 28 April 1780 when  he was on his legs three quarters of an hour, giving a full account of the Board of Works, and a detail of works done by it. On the fall of Lord North in March 1782 he lost his positions but was re-appointed secretary to the Lord Chamberlain and made a Lord of the Admiralty in the Coalition Government in April 1783. He lost both places when the coalition was dismissed in December 1783. The few interventions by him in the 1784-1790 parliament all refer to the work of that Board or of the Lord Chamberlain's office.<ref name = HOP/> Keene continued to sit for Montgomery for the rest of his parliamentary life on the interest of the Earls of Powis and was returned unopposed in [[1784 British general election|1784]],  [[1790 British general election|1790]] and [[1796 British general election|1796]].

He was educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and was awarded BA in 1750.  He joined the army and was lieutenant in the [[5th Foot]] in 1754, captain in 1756 and major in 1762. He served as lieutenant colonel and then colonel in the Portuguese army. He then went to Paris, and attached himself to [[Stephen Fox, 2nd Baron Holland|Stephen Fox]] the brother of Charles James Fox. He soon became acquainted with [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|Lord Hertford]], then ambassador, and  became his master of the horse and gradually his intimate dependant. He retired from the army in 1768. He married Elizabeth Legge, daughter of George, Viscount Lewisham on  1 August 1771.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/keene-whitshed-1731-1822 | title=KEENE, Whitshed (c.1731-1822), of Hawthorn Hill, Berks.| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1754-1790) | accessdate = 21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nKeene was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Wareham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wareham]] at a by-election in November 1768. In 1772 he became Secretary to the Lord Chamberlain, a post he held until March 1782.  In 1774, when he was appointed to the [[Board of Trade]], he was required to undergo re-election but having resigned at Wareham, he was then re-elected at  [[Ludgershall (UK Parliament constituency)|Ludgershall]]  where he sat for 6 months. He  seems never to have spoken in the Parliament of 1768-1774.<ref name = HOP/>\n\nAt the [[1774 British general election|1774 general election]] Keene was returned unopposed at [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomery]] on the Powis interest He was returned there for a total of 44 years by three successive members of the Powis-Clive family. In June 1777 he was removed from the Board of Trade to succeed Thomas Worsley as surveyor general at the [[Office of Works|Board of Works]]. It was believed that Worsley could scarcely outlive the day, but he lived on until December 1778. Keene took up hs post in January 1779 and was paid \u00a32,000 from secret service funds for his loss of salary etc. of the Board of Trade and election expenses.\n\nIn [[1780 British general election|1780]] an opposition to Keene was intended at Montgomery but  the neighbouring country gentleman who was proposed never materialized, and Keene's election was once more unopposed. He made his first speech on record on 28 April 1780 when  he was on his legs three quarters of an hour, giving a full account of the Board of Works, and a detail of works done by it. On the fall of Lord North in March 1782 he lost his positions but was re-appointed secretary to the Lord Chamberlain and made a Lord of the Admiralty in the Coalition Government in April 1783. He lost both places when the coalition was dismissed in December 1783. The few interventions by him in the 1784-1790 parliament all refer to the work of that Board or of the Lord Chamberlain's office.<ref name = HOP/> Keene continued to sit for Montgomery for the rest of his parliamentary life on the interest of the Earls of Powis and was returned unopposed in [[1784 British general election|1784]],  [[1790 British general election|1790]] and [[1796 British general election|1796]].
