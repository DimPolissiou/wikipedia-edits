Evans played [[college football]] at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) and was the MVP of the [[1977 Rose Bowl]] after the [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]]' 14\u20136 victory over [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]].\n\nEvans played professionally for the Bears as well as Chicago's team in the [[United States Football League]], the [[Chicago Blitz]], as well as the USFL's [[Denver Gold]], and the NFL's [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders]] in a career that spanned nearly 20 years from 1977 to 1995. In 1976, he threw for 1,440 yards with 10 touchdowns and six interceptions.  He completed 53.7% of his passes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011-footbl-media-guide.pdf |title=The Greatest Tradition In College Football |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEvans is the only player of the Bears to score a [[List of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a perfect passer rating|perfect quarterback rating]] in a game, doing so against the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1980, completing 18 of 22 passes for 316 yards and three touchdowns.

Smith High in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is one of six players from that program that went on to play pro football. The list includes former Washington Redskins center [[Jeff Bostic]] and his brother Joe. Current Indianapolis Colts tight end [[Eric Ebron]] Also attended Ben L. Smith.\n\nEvans  enrolled at USC and saw his first action during the 1974 season. While at USC, Evans played for future [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] head coach John McKay, and served as an understudy to [[Pat Haden]], who'd later play in the NFL as a member of the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. In his first season of action, Evans completed six of sixteen passes for one touchdown and one interception. USC finished 10-1 and number two in the AP poll that season. The following season, with Haden graduated and off to the NFL, Evans took over as starter. Despite having the talented Ricky Bell and [[Mosi Tatupu]] in the backfield, the Trojans slipped to 8-4 and finished 8-4 and ranked 17 in the final AP poll that season. Even as a starter, Evans only attempted 35 passes that season, and the Trojans applied more of a ground attack than an air game. In Evans' senior season, John Robinson came aboard to replace McKay, he left USC to coach the expansion team in Tampa Bay. Under Robinson, Evans had his best career season, stat wise. He completed 95 passes on 177 attempts, and for the first time, threw more touchdown passes, ten, versus interceptions, six. His primary target that season was receiver [[Sheldon Diggs]], though Tatupu provided a target out of the backfield as well.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/vince-evans-1.html</ref> USC's fortunes in the AP poll improved as well, as the team finished 11-1, with their only loss being the season opener to Missouri. After that, USC rolled off 11 straight wins, which included a 56-0 blowout of the Iowa Hawkeyes. From there, JSC defeated their Pac-8 opponents and even defeated rival Notre Dame 17-13.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> Evans led USC to a 14-6 win over Michigan in the 1977 Rose Bowl. Michigan had raced out to a 6-0 lead thanks to a rushing touchdown by [[Rob Lytle]]. The kick was moissed. Evans led USC down the field later in the second quarter and ran the ball in the end zone himself. The extra point attempt by Glenn Walker was good and the Trojans lead 7-6. Charles White would score a rushing touchdown in the second half to put USC up for good.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> \n\n==Pro career==\nIn 1977, the Bears selected Evans in the 6th round of the draft. Evans was the fourth player drafted by the Bears, behind Tackle [[Ted Albrecht]], defensive back Mike Spivey, and tight end [[Robin Earl]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1977_draft.htm</ref> Evans made the team as a back-up behind [[Bob Avellini]]. Evans did not attempt a pass his rookie season. The Bears, under head coach [[Jack Pardee]] went 9-5 and made the play offs. However, they were crushed by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 37-7.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197712260dal.htm</ref> Evans finally attempted his first NFL pass in 1978, coming off the bench late in a 40-7 blow out loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Both Avellini and [[Mike Phipps]] were ineffective against the Chargers. Evans only complete one of three passes with one interception.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197812040sdg.htm</ref> The following season, under new head coach Neil Armstrong, the Bears went 10-3, with Evans getting a chance as a starter. However, he went 0-3. Avellini lost his starting job to Phipps and Evans was soon promoted ahead of Avellini. In 1980, Evans was a starter for 10 games, going 5-5 during the stretch. One of those games was the infamous thanksgiving game in which the Bears won in overtime when running back Dave Williams returned the opening kick off in overtime 95 yards for a touchdown. It was Evans himself that had tied the game when he scored on a four yard run.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198011270det.htm</ref> However, the Bears missed the play offs and finished 7-9. In 1981, Evans started all sixteen games. He threw for 2,354 yards, eleven touchdowns and twenty interceptions. When he became the starter, Evans became the first African-American quarterback to start for the Bears in franchise history.<ref>https://www.si.com/nfl/list-first-black-starting-quarterback-every-team</ref> The Bears continued to slump, despite having all-pro [[Walter Payton]] in the backfield. At the end of the season, Armstrong was fired and the Bears hired [[Mike Ditka]].\n\nThe Bears under Ditka restructured the quarterback rotation. Phipps was released, and Evans was a back-up again, this time to [[Jim McMahon]], who the Bears selected in the first round of the 1982 draft. Evans would start three games for the Bears in 1983, going 1-2, but his time in Chicago was over. It was over for the Bears that is. He balked at the idea of sharing the starting role with McMahon and turned down an offer to remain with the Bears. Instead, Evans jumped to the USFL. He signed a contract that was reported in the area of five million a year to sign with the [[Chicago Blitz]]. The contract made Evans one of the highest paid quarterbacks in the league at the time.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/sports/sports-people-blitz-signs-evans.html</ref> Evans was signed by the new team owners, as the previous ownership group sold their interest in the team to buy the new franchise in Arizona. In doing so, they took the Blitz head coach, [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] and the starting quarterback [[Greg Landry]] with them. New ownership named [[Marv Levy]] as the head coach and signed Evans as their starting quarterback.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/11/14/Disgruntled-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-has-confirmed-he/5500437634000/</ref>\n\nEvans played only one season for the Blitz. In that season, he completed 200 passes on 411 attempts in the wide open offense that featured running back Tim Spencer and former Notre Dame star [[Kris Haines]] at receiver. Once again he threw more interceptions (22) than he did touchdowns (14). The Blitz finished 5\u201313 and in fifth place.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1984&teamstats=USFLCHI</ref> The next season, with the Blitz folded, Evans joined the [[Denver Gold]]. Again, he threw more interceptions than he did touchdowns. He split time with [[Bob Gagliano]] but the Gold finished with an 11-7 record.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1985&teamstats=USFLDEN</ref> After that 1985 season, the USFL made their ill-fated decision to abandon spring football and try and play in the fall. Because of this, Evans did not play football in 1986. During this time, Evans sued the former ownership of the Blitz. Evans claimed he was owed money form arbitration that was never paid.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/01/Former-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-is-suing-the/1711536475600/</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] where in need of a quarterback. [[Jim Plunkett]] was battling with a shoulder issue, and former first round pick Marc Wilson had failed to live up to lofty expectations. The team also had [[Rusty Hilger]] who they hoped to develop into a starter. Then the NFLPA strike loomed. Evans signed with the Raiders, as did Mark van Allen, a division III quarterback that had been in camp with the raiders. Wilson ended up crossing the picket line. The strike turned out to be Evans' way back in the NFL and it turned out to be his longest lasting tenure with one team in the NFL.<ref>https://raiders.exposure.co/the-replacements</ref> Over the course of the next several season, despite an ever changing cast at quarterback, Evans remained the back-up, serving as much as a coach as he did a back-up. In 1991, he served as a third string quarterback behind [[Jay Schroeder]] and the infamous [[Todd Marinovich]]. In 1992, Evans saw spot duty as the Raiders fell to 7-9 under coach [[Art Shell]]. In 1994, at the age of 38, Evans returned for another season with the Raiders. Schroeder left the Raiders for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and Marinovich was cut, with the Raiders tired of his lack to develop as a player. The Raiders turned to [[Jeff Hostetler]] who a few seasons prior had led the New York Giants to the Super Bowl. This play off run ended the same way it did a few years earlier, with a loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]]. In 1994, at the age of 39, Evans re-signed with the Raiders to serve as their back up. He even got into a couple of games as well. Briefly substituting for Hostetler, Evans complete all two of his passes, including a touchdown pass to Rocket Ismail in the Raiders 24-17 win over the Chargers. the significance of the touchdown pass was that meant that Evans had thrown a touchdown pass in three different decades in the NFL. In 1995, the Raiders returned to the city of Oakland, and they brought Vince Evans with them. Art Shell was fired and Mike White was named head coach. Hostetler was still the starter but the Raiders drafted [[Billy Joe Hobert]] out of the university of Washington to be the quarterback of the future. 1995 would be Evans' final year as an active player. Despite being 40 years old, Evans made three starts for the raiders, going 1-2 during that span. In his first start that season, he led the Raiders to a 30-17 win over the [[Indianapolis Colts]], a team quarterbacked by [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199510220rai.htm</ref> His next start came on the road against the San Diego Chargers. In a game the featured zero touchdowns by either team, Evans threw three interceptions, all to Chargers defensive back Dwayne Harper as the Raiders lost 12-6.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199511270sdg.htm</ref> Evans was the starter the next week against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He went 23 of 37 with two interceptions before he was relieved by Hobert. It would be the last start of Evans' career, and the Raiders lost 29-23 to fall to 8-5.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512030rai.htm</ref> Evans made a brief appearance the following week in the Raiders 31-28 loss to the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512240rai.htm</ref>\n\n==Bears score 61 against Green Bay==\nThe Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is one of the longest rivalries in the NFL. Vince Evans was on the right side of the most lop-sided Bears/Packers game of all-time. The date was December 7, 1980. This was the second meeting between the Bears and Packers that season. In the first match-up, the Packers won in overtime when packers placekicker [[Chester Macrol]] advanced a blocked field goal 25 yards for a touchdown. The rematch started off slow, until Walter Payton scored three times in the second quarter to give the Bears a halftime lead. Evans himself accounted for three touchdown passes. The Green Bay fanbase was upset that after Payton and many of the starters were pulling in the second half, Payton re-entered the game to score a rushing touchdown to make it 55-7. While Evans had one of his best games as a pro, the significance of the outcome was that the bears had failed to score a single touchdown in the three previous meetings against the Packers.<ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2015/12/7/18609907/35-years-ago-today-bears-beat-packers-in-most-lopsided-game-in-series-history</ref>\n\n==Post NFL career==\nEvans later admitted he let his ego get in the way when he bolted the NFL for the USFL. Jim McMahon ended up getting injured during his rookie season, which means Evans would have gotten more playing time. After the USFL folded, Evans figured his resume would get him a look from teams in the NFL. It didn't and the only door that opened was when the players went on strike and owners decided to continue the season with replacement players. Evans was one of a few that was kept by the Raiders after the strike ended. Though he admitted that playing in the USFL was a mistake, he felt proud that he was firm in playing quarterback in the NFL, though he felt more pressure as an African-American playing quarterback in the NFL. He was happy to see Doug Williams become the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. After leaving football, Evans built a successful real estate career in Southern California.<ref>https://theundefeated.com/features/usc-bears-nfl-vince-evans-black-quarterback/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{USC Trojans quarterback navbox}}\n{{Bears1977DraftPicks}}\n{{Chicago Bears starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{Oakland Raiders starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{NFL quarterbacks with a perfect passer rating}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Evans, Vince}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football quarterbacks]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Blitz players]]\n[[Category:Denver Gold players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles City Cubs football players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Raiders players]]\n[[Category:National Football League replacement players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Raiders players]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans football players]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American football player}}\n{{For|other people named Vincent Evans|Vincent Evans (disambiguation){{!}}Vincent Evans}}\n{{Infobox NFL biography\n|image= \n|position=[[Quarterback]]\n|number=8, 11, 29\n|birth_date={{birth date and age|1955|6|14}}\n|birth_place=[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n|draftyear=1977\n|draftround=6\n|draftpick=140\n|high_school=Ben L.

In Evans' senior season, John Robinson came aboard to replace McKay, he left USC to coach the expansion team in Tampa Bay. Under Robinson, Evans had his best career season, stat wise. He completed 95 passes on 177 attempts, and for the first time, threw more touchdown passes, ten, versus interceptions, six. His primary target that season was receiver [[Sheldon Diggs]], though Tatupu provided a target out of the backfield as well.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/vince-evans-1.html</ref> USC's fortunes in the AP poll improved as well, as the team finished 11-1, with their only loss being the season opener to Missouri. After that, USC rolled off 11 straight wins, which included a 56-0 blowout of the Iowa Hawkeyes. From there, JSC defeated their Pac-8 opponents and even defeated rival Notre Dame 17-13.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> Evans led USC to a 14-6 win over Michigan in the 1977 Rose Bowl. Michigan had raced out to a 6-0 lead thanks to a rushing touchdown by [[Rob Lytle]]. The kick was moissed. Evans led USC down the field later in the second quarter and ran the ball in the end zone himself. The extra point attempt by Glenn Walker was good and the Trojans lead 7-6. Charles White would score a rushing touchdown in the second half to put USC up for good.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html</ref> \n\n==Pro career==\nIn 1977, the Bears selected Evans in the 6th round of the draft. Evans was the fourth player drafted by the Bears, behind Tackle [[Ted Albrecht]], defensive back Mike Spivey, and tight end [[Robin Earl]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1977_draft.htm</ref> Evans made the team as a back-up behind [[Bob Avellini]]. Evans did not attempt a pass his rookie season. The Bears, under head coach [[Jack Pardee]] went 9-5 and made the play offs. However, they were crushed by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 37-7.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197712260dal.htm</ref> Evans finally attempted his first NFL pass in 1978, coming off the bench late in a 40-7 blow out loss to the [[San Diego Chargers]]. Both Avellini and [[Mike Phipps]] were ineffective against the Chargers. Evans only complete one of three passes with one interception.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197812040sdg.htm</ref> The following season, under new head coach Neil Armstrong, the Bears went 10-3, with Evans getting a chance as a starter. However, he went 0-3. Avellini lost his starting job to Phipps and Evans was soon promoted ahead of Avellini. In 1980, Evans was a starter for 10 games, going 5-5 during the stretch. One of those games was the infamous thanksgiving game in which the Bears won in overtime when running back Dave Williams returned the opening kick off in overtime 95 yards for a touchdown. It was Evans himself that had tied the game when he scored on a four yard run.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198011270det.htm</ref> However, the Bears missed the play offs and finished 7-9. In 1981, Evans started all sixteen games. He threw for 2,354 yards, eleven touchdowns and twenty interceptions. When he became the starter, Evans became the first African-American quarterback to start for the Bears in franchise history.<ref>https://www.si.com/nfl/list-first-black-starting-quarterback-every-team</ref> The Bears continued to slump, despite having all-pro [[Walter Payton]] in the backfield. At the end of the season, Armstrong was fired and the Bears hired [[Mike Ditka]].\n\nThe Bears under Ditka restructured the quarterback rotation. Phipps was released, and Evans was a back-up again, this time to [[Jim McMahon]], who the Bears selected in the first round of the 1982 draft. Evans would start three games for the Bears in 1983, going 1-2, but his time in Chicago was over. It was over for the Bears that is. He balked at the idea of sharing the starting role with McMahon and turned down an offer to remain with the Bears. Instead, Evans jumped to the USFL. He signed a contract that was reported in the area of five million a year to sign with the [[Chicago Blitz]]. The contract made Evans one of the highest paid quarterbacks in the league at the time.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/sports/sports-people-blitz-signs-evans.html</ref> Evans was signed by the new team owners, as the previous ownership group sold their interest in the team to buy the new franchise in Arizona. In doing so, they took the Blitz head coach, [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] and the starting quarterback [[Greg Landry]] with them. New ownership named [[Marv Levy]] as the head coach and signed Evans as their starting quarterback.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/11/14/Disgruntled-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-has-confirmed-he/5500437634000/</ref>\n\nEvans played only one season for the Blitz. In that season, he completed 200 passes on 411 attempts in the wide open offense that featured running back Tim Spencer and former Notre Dame star [[Kris Haines]] at receiver. Once again he threw more interceptions (22) than he did touchdowns (14). The Blitz finished 5-13 and in fifth place.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1984&teamstats=USFLCHI</ref> The next season, with the Blitz folded, Evans joined the [[Denver Gold]]. Again, he threw more interceptions than he did touchdowns. He split time with [[Bob Gagliano]] but the Gold finished with an 11-7 record.<ref>https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1985&teamstats=USFLDEN</ref> After that 1985 season, the USFL made their ill-fated decison to abandon spring football and try and play in the fall. Because of this, Evans did not play football in 1986. During this time, Evans sued the former ownership of the Blitz. Evans claimed he was owed money form arbitration that was never paid.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/01/Former-Chicago-Bears-quarterback-Vince-Evans-is-suing-the/1711536475600/</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] where in need of a quarterback. [[Jim Plunkett]] was battling with a shoulder issue, and former first round pick Marc Wilson had failed to live up to lofty expectations. The team also had [[Rusty Hilger]] who they hoped to develop into a starter. Then the NFLPA strike loomed. Evans signed with the Raiders, as did Mark van Allen, a division III quarterback that had been in camp with the raiders. Wilson ended up crossing the picket line. The strike turned out to be Evans' way back in the NFL and it turned out to be his longest lasting tenure with one team in the NFL.<ref>https://raiders.exposure.co/the-replacements</ref> Over the course of the next several season, despite an ever changing cast at quarterback, Evans remained the back-up, serving as much as a coach as he did a back-up. In 1991, he served as a third string quarterback behind [[Jay Schroeder]] and the infamous [[Todd Marinovich]]. In 1992, Evans saw spot duty as the Raiders fell to 7-9 under coach [[Art Shell]]. In 1994, at the age of 38, Evans returned for another season with the Raiders. Schroeder left the Raiders for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] and Marinovich was cut, with the Raiders tired of his lack to develop as a player. The Raiders turned to [[Jeff Hostetler]] who a few seasons prior had led the New York Giants to the Super Bowl. This play off run ended the same way it did a few years earlier, with a loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]]. In 1994, at the age of 39, Evans re-signed with the Raiders to serve as their back up. He even got into a couple of games as well. Briefly substituting for Hostetler, Evans complete all two of his passes, including a touchdown pass to Rocket Ismail in the Raiders 24-17 win over the Chargers. the significance of the touchdown pass was that meant that Evans had thrown a touchdown pass in three different decades in the NFL. In 1995, the Raiders returned to the city of Oakland, and they brought Vince Evans with them. Art Shell was fired and Mike White was named head coach. Hostetler was still the starter but the Raiders drafted [[Billy Joe Hobert]] out of the university of Washington to be the quarterback of the future. 1995 would be Evans' final year as an active player. Despite being 40 years old, Evans made three starts for the raiders, going 1-2 during that span. In his first start that season, he led the Raiders to a 30-17 win over the [[Indianapolis Colts]], a team quarterbacked by [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199510220rai.htm</ref> His next start came on the road against the San Diego Chargers. In a game the featured zero touchdowns by either team, Evans threw three interceptions, all to Chargers defensive back Dwayne Harper as the Raiders lost 12-6.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199511270sdg.htm</ref> Evans was the starter the next week against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He went 23 of 37 with two interceptions before he was relieved by Hobert. It would be the last start of Evans' career, and the Raiders lost 29-23 to fall to 8-5.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512030rai.htm</ref> Evans made a brief appearance the following week in the Raiders 31-28 loss to the [[Denver Broncos]].<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512240rai.htm</ref>\n\n==Bears score 61 against Green Bay==\nThe Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is one of the longest rivalries in the NFL. Vince Evans was on the right side of the most lop-sided Bears/Packers game of all-time. The date was December 7, 1980. This was the second meeting between the Bears and Packers that season. In the first match-up, the Packers won in overtime when packers placekicker [[Chester Macrol]] advanced a blocked field goal 25 yards for a touchdown. The rematch started off slow, until Walter Payton scored three times in the second quarter to give the Bears a halftime lead. Evans himself accounted for three touchdown passes. The Green Bay fanbase was upset that after Payton and many of the starters were pulling in the second half, Payton re-entered the game to score a rushing touchdown to make it 55-7. While Evans had one of his best games as a pro, the significance of the outcome was that the bears had failed to score a single touchdown in the three previous meetings against the Packers.<ref>https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2015/12/7/18609907/35-years-ago-today-bears-beat-packers-in-most-lopsided-game-in-series-history</ref>\n\n==Post NFL career==\nEvans later admitted he let his ego get in the way when he bolted the NFL for the USFL. Jim McMahon ended up getting injured during his rookie season, which means Evans would have gotten more playing time. After the USFL folded, Evans figured his resume would get him a look from teams in the NFL. It didn't and the only door that opened was when the players went on strike and owners decided to continue the season with replacement players. Evans was one of a few that was kept by the Raiders after the strike ended. Though he admitted that playing in the USFL was a mistake, he felt proud that he was firm in playing quarterback in the NFL, though he felt more pressure as an African-American playing quarterback in the NFL. He was happy to see Doug Williams become the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. After leaving football, Evans built a successful real estate career in Southern California.<ref>https://theundefeated.com/features/usc-bears-nfl-vince-evans-black-quarterback/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{USC Trojans quarterback navbox}}\n{{Bears1977DraftPicks}}\n{{Chicago Bears starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{Oakland Raiders starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{NFL quarterbacks with a perfect passer rating}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Evans, Vince}}\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football quarterbacks]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bears players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Blitz players]]\n[[Category:Denver Gold players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles City Cubs football players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Raiders players]]\n[[Category:National Football League replacement players]]\n[[Category:Oakland Raiders players]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans football players]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Greensboro, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "DocWatson42", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made two minor corrections.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Evans"}

Variations of the typical birthday cake include birthday [[cupcake]]s, [[cake pop]]s, [[Pastry|pastries]], and [[tart]]s. Birthday cakes are often vanilla-, chocolate-, or strawberry-flavored. They are baked in a variety of shapes and decorated with [[Icing (food)|icing]] or [[Fondant icing|fondant]], often in multiple colors.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pancraz K\u00f6rle Die Geburtstagstorte.jpg|thumb|''The Birthday Cake'' by 19th-century German [[genre painter]] {{ill|Pancraz K\u00f6rle|de}}.]]\nBirthday cakes have been a part of birthday celebrations in Western European countries since the middle of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglandrecipes.org/html/birthday-cake.html|title=Birthday Cakes: History & Recipes - Online article with an extensive bibliography}}</ref>  However, the link between cakes and birthday celebrations may date back to ancient Roman times.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome|classical Roman culture]], 'cakes' were occasionally served at special birthdays and at [[wedding]]s. These were flat circles made from flour and nuts, leavened with yeast, and sweetened with honey.\n\nIn the 15th century, bakeries in Germany began to market one-layer cakes for customers' birthdays as opposed to only marketing cakes for weddings, and thus the modern birthday cake was born.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://yourkoseli.com/2019/06/21/history-of-birthday-cake/ |title=History of Birthday Cakes |publisher= Your Koseli |access-date=16 June 2019 }}</ref> During the 17th century, the birthday cake took on its contemporary form. These elaborate 17th century cakes had many aspects of the contemporary birthday cake, like multiple layers, icing, and decorations. However, these cakes were only available to the very wealthy. Birthday cakes became accessible to the lower class as a result of the industrial revolution and the spread of more materials and goods.\n\n==Contemporary rites==\n[[File:Child with Snow White cake 1910-1940.jpg|thumb|Child with Snow White Cake, circa 1930\u20131940]]\nThe cake, pastry, or dessert is served to a person on their birthday. In contemporary Western cultures, the cake is topped with one or more lit candles, which the celebrated individual attempts to blow out.\n\nThere is no standard for birthday cakes, though the \"[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]\" song is often sung while the cake is served in English-speaking countries, or an equivalent birthday song in the appropriate language of the country. The phrase \"happy birthday\" did not appear on birthday cakes until the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" was popularized in the early 1900s. Variations of birthday songs and rituals exist in different parts of the world. In Uruguay, party guests touch the person's shoulder or head following the singing of \"Happy Birthday to You\". In [[Ecuador]], the person whose birthday it is will take a large bite of the birthday cake before it is served. In [[Peru]], guests used to sing \"Happy Birthday to You\" first in English with the name of the individual whose birthday it is, then in Spanish, later they sing any other song in Spanish regarding cake or date, finally blowing candles and serving the [[[https://cakepark.net/birthday-cakes-chennai/ name cake]]].\n\nThe birthday cake is often [[Cake decorating|decorated]] with small candles, secured with special holders or simply pressed down into the cake. The cake can also be served with other sweets such as ice cream. In the UK, North America and Australia, the number of candles is equal to the age of the individual whose birthday it is, sometimes with one extra for luck. Traditionally, the person whose birthday it is makes a wish, which is thought to come true if all the candles are extinguished in a single breath.\n\nTo represent a sharing of joy and a sense of togetherness, the cake is shared amongst all the guests attending the party.\n\n==Candles and theories of origin==\n{{See also|History of candle making}}\n[[Image:Birthday candles.jpg|thumb|Modern Celebration Candles.]]\nThough the exact origin and significance of the candle blowing ritual is unknown, there are multiple theories which try to explain this tradition.\n\n===Greek origin story===\nOne theory explaining the tradition of placing candles on birthday cakes is attributed to the early Greeks, who used candles to honor the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The link between her oversight of fertility and the birthday tradition of candles on cakes, however, has not been established.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Pagan origin story===\n[[Image:Ludwig Knaus - Ein Kinderfest (1868).jpg|thumb|Kinder Fest.]]\n\nThe use of fire in certain rites dates back to the creation of altars. Birthday candles are said to hold symbolic power.<ref>(The Lore of Birthdays (New York, 1952), Ralph and Adelin Linton, pp. 8, 18-20.)</ref>\n\nIn the past it was believed that evil spirits visited people on their birthdays and that, to protect the person whose birthday it was from evil, people must surround the individual and make them merry. Party-goers made noise to scare away evil spirits.\n\n===German origin story===\n[[File:Girls with birthday cake. Postcard from 1920.jpg|thumb|Girls with birthday cake. Postcard from 1920.]]\nIn 18th century Germany, the history of candles on cakes can be traced back to Kinderfest, a birthday celebration for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhausbarn.com/?page_id=70%7ctitle=Germanhausbarn|title=Keeping the Legacy|work=German Hausbarn}}</ref> This tradition also makes use of candles and cakes. German children were taken to an auditorium-like space. There, they were free to celebrate another year in a place where Germans believed that adults protected children from the evil spirits attempting to steal their souls. In those times there was no tradition of bringing gifts to a birthday; guests would merely bring good wishes for the birthday person. However, if a guest did bring gifts it was considered to be a good sign for the person whose birthday it was. Later, flowers became quite popular as a birthday gift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokenz.com/history-of-birthday.html|title=History of Birthdays}}</ref>\n* In 1746, a large birthday festival was held for Count [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf|Ludwig von Zinzendorf]] at Marienborn near [[B\u00fcdingen]]. Andrew Frey described the party in detail and mentions, \"there was a Cake as large as any Oven could be found to bake it, and Holes made in the Cake according to the Years of the Person\u2019s Age, every one having a Candle stuck into it, and one in the Middle.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = A true and authentic account of Andrew Frey.

Rather than serving one large pastry, each guest is served their own small shou bao. In Korea, the traditional birthday dish is seaweed soup. In Western Russia, birthday children are served fruit pies with a birthday greeting carved into the crusts. The Swedish birthday cake is made like a [[pound cake]] that is often topped with marzipan and decorated with the national flag. Dutch birthday pastries are fruit tarts topped with whipped cream. In [[India]] there are very few people who use birth celebration in villages, but in cities and towns, birthday cakes are used similarly as in western countries, especially among people with higher education.\n\n==The ritual of blowing out birthday candles==\n\nIn many cultures the person whose birthday is being celebrated is invited to make a wish, and blow out candles.<ref name=Atlantic2017-07-27/><ref name=TheIndependent2017-07-31/><ref name=FoodAndWine2017-07-28/>\n\nIn June 2017 researchers at [[Clemson University]] reported that some individuals deposit a large number of bacteria on the cake.<ref name=Atlantic2017-07-27/><ref name=TheIndependent2017-07-31/><ref name=FoodAndWine2017-07-28/><ref name=\"FoodResearch\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Birthday Cake with 2.jpg|2nd anniversary Birthday cake\nFile:Grandma's birthday cake for grandson.jpg|Christmas tree birthday cake \nFile:1sugarcraftcake.jpg|Birthday cake with 'Happy Birthday Mum' message\nFile:ENGINEER'S BIRTHDAY CAKE.jpg|A large homemade birthday cake \nFile:Birthday cake (8973445388).jpg|Birthday Cake\nFile:Birthday cake for one-year old.jpg|Elaborate birthday cake\nFile:Juliana Tea Party.jpg|Birthday cake featuring edible miniature birthday party.\nFile:Tarta de cumplea\u00f1os, 18 a\u00f1os (RPS 10-09-2014).png|18th birthday cake\nFile:Birthday cake (SM City Santa Mesa, Aurora Blvd., Quezon City; 2015-09-11).jpg|Chocolate with mixed fruit birthday cake\nFile:Pink seolgitteok cake.jpg|[[Tteok]]-cake (birthday cake made of rice cakes)\nFile:Birthday cake, Downpatrick, April 2010 (02).JPG|Creamy raspberry birthday cake\nFile:Torta de Cumplea\u00f1os.jpg|Football player birthday cake\nFile:Cake 6.jpg|Homemade birthday cake\nFile:3rd birthday cake (Unsplash 10b8Lvvc-4g).jpg|3rd anniversary rainbow birthday cake\nFile:Celebration cake for the 100th anniversary.jpg|German celebration cake for a 100th birthday\nFile:Ladybird birthday cake.jpg|Ladybird cartoon birthday cake\nFile:Birthday cake for Basia, Brisbane, February 2019.jpg|Mixed fruit birthday cake \n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wedding cake]]\n* [[List of desserts]]\n* [[Birthday]]\n* [[Rite of passage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=FoodResearch>\n{{cite news\n| url         = http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jfr/article/view/67217\n| title       = Bacterial Transfer Associated with Blowing Out Candles on a Birthday Cake\n| work        = [[Journal of Food Research]]\n| author      = Paul Dawson, Inyee Han, Danielle Lynn, Jenevieve Lackey, Johnson Baker, Rose Martinez-Dawson\n| year        = 2017\n| volume      = 6\n| number      = 4\n| accessdate  = 2017-12-03\n| url-status     = live\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Atlantic2017-07-27>\n{{cite news\n| url         = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/07/birthday-candle-bacteria/534987/\n| title       = Blowing Out Birthday Candles Increases Cake Bacteria by 1,400 Percent: But it\u2019s okay, really!\n| work        = [[Atlantic magazine]]\n| author      = Sarah Zhang\n| date        = 2017-07-27\n| accessdate  = 2017-12-03\n| url-status     = live\n| quote       = On average, blowing out the candles increased the amount of bacteria on the frosting by 14 times.

Variations of the typical birthday cake include birthday [[cupcake]]s, [[cake pop]]s, [[Pastry|pastries]], and [[tart]]s. Birthday cakes are often vanilla-, chocolate-, or strawberry-flavored. They are baked in a variety of shapes and decorated with [[Icing (food)|icing]] or [[Fondant icing|fondant]], often in multiple colors.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Pancraz K\u00f6rle Die Geburtstagstorte.jpg|thumb|''The Birthday Cake'' by 19th-century German [[genre painter]] {{ill|Pancraz K\u00f6rle|de}}.]]\nBirthday cakes have been a part of birthday celebrations in Western European countries since the middle of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglandrecipes.org/html/birthday-cake.html|title=Birthday Cakes: History & Recipes - Online article with an extensive bibliography}}</ref>  However, the link between cakes and birthday celebrations may date back to ancient Roman times.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome|classical Roman culture]], 'cakes' were occasionally served at special birthdays and at [[wedding]]s. These were flat circles made from flour and nuts, leavened with yeast, and sweetened with honey.\n\nIn the 15th century, bakeries in Germany began to market one-layer cakes for customers' birthdays as opposed to only marketing cakes for weddings, and thus the modern birthday cake was born.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://yourkoseli.com/2019/06/21/history-of-birthday-cake/ |title=History of Birthday Cakes |publisher= Your Koseli |access-date=16 June 2019 }}</ref> During the 17th century, the birthday cake took on its contemporary form. These elaborate 17th century cakes had many aspects of the contemporary birthday cake, like multiple layers, icing, and decorations. However, these cakes were only available to the very wealthy. Birthday cakes became accessible to the lower class as a result of the industrial revolution and the spread of more materials and goods.\n\n==Contemporary rites==\n[[File:Child with Snow White cake 1910-1940.jpg|thumb|Child with Snow White Cake, circa 1930\u20131940]]\nThe cake, pastry, or dessert is served to a person on their birthday. In contemporary Western cultures, the cake is topped with one or more lit candles, which the celebrated individual attempts to blow out.\n\nThere is no standard for birthday cakes, though the \"[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]\" song is often sung while the cake is served in English-speaking countries, or an equivalent birthday song in the appropriate language of the country. The phrase \"happy birthday\" did not appear on birthday cakes until the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" was popularized in the early 1900s. Variations of birthday songs and rituals exist in different parts of the world. In Uruguay, party guests touch the person's shoulder or head following the singing of \"Happy Birthday to You\". In [[Ecuador]], the person whose birthday it is will take a large bite of the birthday cake before it is served. In [[Peru]], guests used to sing \"Happy Birthday to You\" first in English with the name of the individual whose birthday it is, then in Spanish, later they sing any other song in Spanish regarding cake or date, finally blowing candles and serving the [[name cake]].\n\nThe birthday cake is often [[Cake decorating|decorated]] with small candles, secured with special holders or simply pressed down into the cake. The cake can also be served with other sweets such as ice cream. In the UK, North America and Australia, the number of candles is equal to the age of the individual whose birthday it is, sometimes with one extra for luck. Traditionally, the person whose birthday it is makes a wish, which is thought to come true if all the candles are extinguished in a single breath.\n\nTo represent a sharing of joy and a sense of togetherness, the cake is shared amongst all the guests attending the party.\n\n==Candles and theories of origin==\n{{See also|History of candle making}}\n[[Image:Birthday candles.jpg|thumb|Modern Celebration Candles.]]\nThough the exact origin and significance of the candle blowing ritual is unknown, there are multiple theories which try to explain this tradition.\n\n===Greek origin story===\nOne theory explaining the tradition of placing candles on birthday cakes is attributed to the early Greeks, who used candles to honor the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The link between her oversight of fertility and the birthday tradition of candles on cakes, however, has not been established.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Pagan origin story===\n[[Image:Ludwig Knaus - Ein Kinderfest (1868).jpg|thumb|Kinder Fest.]]\n\nThe use of fire in certain rites dates back to the creation of altars. Birthday candles are said to hold symbolic power.<ref>(The Lore of Birthdays (New York, 1952), Ralph and Adelin Linton, pp. 8, 18-20.)</ref>\n\nIn the past it was believed that evil spirits visited people on their birthdays and that, to protect the person whose birthday it was from evil, people must surround the individual and make them merry. Party-goers made noise to scare away evil spirits.\n\n===German origin story===\n[[File:Girls with birthday cake. Postcard from 1920.jpg|thumb|Girls with birthday cake. Postcard from 1920.]]\nIn 18th century Germany, the history of candles on cakes can be traced back to Kinderfest, a birthday celebration for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhausbarn.com/?page_id=70%7ctitle=Germanhausbarn|title=Keeping the Legacy|work=German Hausbarn}}</ref> This tradition also makes use of candles and cakes. German children were taken to an auditorium-like space. There, they were free to celebrate another year in a place where Germans believed that adults protected children from the evil spirits attempting to steal their souls. In those times there was no tradition of bringing gifts to a birthday; guests would merely bring good wishes for the birthday person. However, if a guest did bring gifts it was considered to be a good sign for the person whose birthday it was. Later, flowers became quite popular as a birthday gift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokenz.com/history-of-birthday.html|title=History of Birthdays}}</ref>\n* In 1746, a large birthday festival was held for Count [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf|Ludwig von Zinzendorf]] at Marienborn near [[B\u00fcdingen]].

It states that each interpersonal behavior invites certain responses of another interactant. The behavior and the response it invites are said to be complementary (Horowitz, Dryer, & Krasnoperova, 1997) when friendly behavior begets hostile behavior, and dominant behavior begets submissive behavior. When people fail to give the invited response, it is said to be a non-complementary interaction. If the first person's behavior invites a reaction from the second person that matches the second person's goals, then the second person is satisfied; otherwise, the second person is frustrated (Dryer & Horowitz, 1997).\n\n===Factors affecting complementarity===\n* '''''Setting''' i.e. in work, at home, in recreation and others''\n{{quote|High complementarity in agentic behaviors is found in office settings whereas high complementarity in communal behaviors is found in non-office settings (Moskowitz et al. 2007). In an office setting, dominant agentic behaviors such as setting goals and making suggestions may be complemented with submissive agentic behaviors like avoiding taking the lead and not expressing their own views. At home, recreation and others, on the one hand, friendly communal behaviors such as smiling may invite similar behaviors like compromising about a decision. On the other hand, hostile communal behaviors like showing impatience may beget similar behaviors like showing no response to partners (Moskowitz et al. 2007).}}\n* '''''Social Role Status''' e.g. supervisors, coworker and supervisee''\n{{quote|High complementarity is found in supervisors (high-status, high-powered), they can act freely in their own way. Less complementarity is found in supervisees (low-status, low-powered), as they are normally guided by social norms which mold their behaviors. (Moskowitz, 2007; Locke, 2007).}}\n*'''''Time''' e.g. strangers, old friends''\n{{quote|High levels of complementarity are presumed to be more stable over time than those low levels of complementarity (Tracey, 2004). Greater levels of complementarity are developed when people have known each other for a long time than when they are newly acquainted (Tracey, 2004; Markey, Kurtz, 2006 stated in Moskowitz, 2007). However, contradictory result is also found in a study conducted by Ansell (2008).}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arranged marriage]]\n* [[Emotional conflict]]\n* [[Conflictology]]\n* [[Dating]]\n* [[Endogamy]]\n* [[Family therapy]]\n* [[Friendship]]\n* [[Interpersonal attraction]]\n* [[Interpersonal communication]]\n* [[Interpersonal relations]]\n* [[Irreconcilable differences]]\n* [[Love]]\n* [[Marriage#Selection of a partner|Selection of a partner]]\n* [[Social interaction]]\n* [[Sociometry]]\n* [[Socionics]]\n* [[Substance dependence]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Action G.

However, their preference was reversed if they were taking oral contraceptives.<ref name=\"wedekind\">{{cite journal |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |last=Wedekind |first=C. |author2=Seebeck, T. |author3=Bettens, F. |author4= Paepke, A.J.  |date=June 1995 |journal=Proc Biol Sci |volume=260 |issue=1359 |pages=245\u2013249 |pmid=7630893 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087|bibcode=1995RSPSB.260..245W }}</ref> The hypothesis is that MHCs affect mate choice and that oral contraceptives can interfere with the preference for variation.

It states that each interpersonal behavior invites certain responses of another interactant. The behavior and the response it invites are said to be complementary (Horowitz, Dryer, & Krasnoperova, 1997) when friendly behavior begets hostile behavior, and dominant behavior begets submissive behavior. When people fail to give the invited response, it is said to be a non-complementary interaction. If the first person's behavior invites a reaction from the second person that matches the second person's goals, then the second person is satisfied; otherwise, the second person is frustrated (Dryer & Horowitz, 1997).\n\n===Factors affecting complementarity===\n* '''''Setting''' i.e. in work, at home, in recreation and others''\n{{quote|High complementarity in agentic behaviors is found in office settings whereas high complementarity in communal behaviors is found in non-office settings (Moskowitz et al. 2007). In an office setting, dominant agentic behaviors such as setting goals and making suggestions may be complemented with submissive agentic behaviors like avoiding taking the lead and not expressing their own views. At home, recreation and others, on the one hand, friendly communal behaviors such as smiling may invite similar behaviors like compromising about a decision. On the other hand, hostile communal behaviors like showing impatience may beget similar behaviors like showing no response to partners (Moskowitz et al. 2007).}}\n* '''''Social Role Status''' e.g. supervisors, coworker and supervisee''\n{{quote|High complementarity is found in supervisors (high-status, high-powered), they can act freely in their own way. Less complementarity is found in supervisees (low-status, low-powered), as they are normally guided by social norms which mold their behaviors. (Moskowitz, 2007; Locke, 2007).}}\n*'''''Time''' e.g. strangers, old friends''\n{{quote|High levels of complementarity are presumed to be more stable over time than those low levels of complementarity (Tracey, 2004). Greater levels of complementarity are developed when people have known each other for a long time than when they are newly acquainted (Tracey, 2004; Markey, Kurtz, 2006 stated in Moskowitz, 2007). However, contradictory result is also found in a study conducted by Ansell (2008).}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arranged marriage]]\n* [[Emotional conflict]]\n* [[Conflictology]]\n* [[Dating]]\n* [[Endogamy]]\n* [[Family therapy]]\n* [[Friendship]]\n* [[Interpersonal attraction]]\n* [[Interpersonal communication]]\n* [[Interpersonal relations]]\n* [[Irreconcilable differences]]\n* [[Love]]\n* [[Marriage#Selection of a partner|Selection of a partner]]\n* [[Social interaction]]\n* [[Sociometry]]\n* [[Socionics]]\n* [[Substance dependence]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Action G.
