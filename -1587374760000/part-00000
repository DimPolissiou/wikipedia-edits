They are named after [[Augustus De Morgan]], a 19th-century British mathematician. The rules allow the expression of [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] and [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]] purely in terms of each other via [[logical negation|negation]].\n\nThe rules can be expressed in English as:\n:the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations; and\n:the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations;\nor\n:the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements; and\n:the complement of the intersection of two sets is the same as the union of their complements.\nor\n:not (A or B) = not A and not B; and\n:not (A and B) = not A or not B\n\nIn [[set theory]] and [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], these are written formally as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\overline{A \\cup B} &= \\overline{A} \\cap \\overline{B}, \\\\\n  \\overline{A \\cap B} &= \\overline{A} \\cup \\overline{B},\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere\n* ''A'' and ''B'' are sets,\n* {{overline|''A''}} is the complement of A,\n* \u2229 is the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], and\n* \u222a is the [[Union (set theory)|union]].\n\nIn [[formal language]], the rules are written as\n:<math>\\neg(P\\lor Q)\\iff(\\neg P)\\land(\\neg Q),</math>\nand\n:<math>\\neg(P\\land Q)\\iff(\\neg P)\\lor(\\neg Q)</math>\nwhere\n* ''P'' and ''Q are propositions,''\n* [[Negation|<math>\\neg</math>]] is the negation logic operator (NOT),\n* [[Logical_conjunction|<math>\\land</math>]] is the conjunction logic operator (AND),\n* [[Logical_disjunction|<math>\\lor</math>]] is the disjunction logic operator (OR),\n* [[If_and_only_if|<math>\\iff</math>]] is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning \"can be replaced in a [[formal proof|logical proof]] with\".\n\nApplications of the rules include simplification of logical [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] in [[computer program]]s and digital circuit designs. De Morgan's laws are an example of a more general concept of [[duality (mathematics)|mathematical duality]].\n\n==Formal notation==\nThe ''negation of conjunction'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:\n:<math>\\neg(P \\land Q) \\vdash (\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q)</math>,\nand\n:<math>(\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q) \\vdash \\neg(P \\land Q)</math>.\n\nThe ''negation of disjunction'' rule may be written as:\n:<math>\\neg(P \\lor Q) \\vdash (\\neg P \\land \\neg Q)</math>,\nand\n:<math>(\\neg P \\land \\neg Q) \\vdash \\neg(P \\lor Q)</math>.\n\nIn [[Rule of inference|rule form]]: ''negation of conjunction''\n:<math>\\frac{\\neg (P \\land Q)}{\\therefore \\neg P \\lor \\neg Q}</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q}{\\therefore \\neg (P \\land Q)}</math>\n\nand ''negation of disjunction''\n:<math>\\frac{\\neg (P \\lor Q)}{\\therefore \\neg P \\land \\neg Q}</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\neg P \\land \\neg Q}{\\therefore \\neg (P \\lor Q)}</math>\n\nand expressed as a truth-functional [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\neg (P \\land Q) &\\to (\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q), \\\\\n  (\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q) &\\to \\neg (P \\land Q), \\\\\n   \\neg (P \\lor Q) &\\to (\\neg P \\land \\neg Q), \\\\\n   (\\neg P \\land \\neg Q) &\\to \\neg (P \\lor Q),\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> and <math>Q</math> are propositions expressed in some formal system.\n\n===Substitution form===\nDe Morgan's laws are normally shown in the compact form above, with negation of the output on the left and negation of the inputs on the right. A clearer form for substitution can be stated as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  (P \\land Q) &\\equiv \\neg (\\neg P \\lor \\neg Q), \\\\\n   (P \\lor Q) &\\equiv \\neg (\\neg P \\land \\neg Q).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis emphasizes the need to invert both the inputs and the output, as well as change the operator, when doing a substitution.\n\n===Set theory and Boolean algebra===\nIn set theory and [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], it is often stated as \"union and intersection interchange under complementation\",<ref>''Boolean Algebra'' by R. L.

Presented in English, this follows the logic that \"since two things are both false, it is also false that either of them is true\".\n\nWorking in the opposite direction, the second expression asserts that A is false and B is false (or equivalently that \"not A\" and \"not B\" are true). Knowing this, a disjunction of A and B must be false also. The negation of said disjunction must thus be true, and the result is identical to the first claim.\n\n===Negation of a conjunction===\nThe application of De Morgan's theorem to a conjunction is very similar to its application to a disjunction both in form and rationale.  Consider the following claim: \"it is false that A and B are both true\", which is written as:\n:<math>\\neg(A\\land B).</math>\nIn order for this claim to be true, either or both of A or B must be false, for if they both were true, then the conjunction of A and B would be true, making its negation false. Thus, [[inclusive or|one (at least) or more]] of A and B must be false (or equivalently, one or more of \"not A\" and \"not B\" must be true). This may be written directly as,\n:<math>(\\neg A)\\lor(\\neg B).</math>\nPresented in English, this follows the logic that \"since it is false that two things are both true, at least one of them must be false\".\n\nWorking in the opposite direction again, the second expression asserts that at least one of \"not A\" and \"not B\" must be true, or equivalently that at least one of A and B must be false. Since at least one of them must be false, then their conjunction would likewise be false. Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression, and this expression is identical to the first claim.\n\n==Formal proof==\nHere we use <math>A^\\complement</math>to denote the complement of A. The proof that <math>(A\\cap B)^\\complement = A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math> is completed in 2 steps by proving both <math>(A\\cap B)^\\complement \\subseteq A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math> and <math>A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\subseteq (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>. \n\n===Part 1===\n\nLet <math>x \\in (A \\cap B)^\\complement</math>. Then, <math>x \\not\\in A \\cap B</math>.\n\nBecause <math>A \\cap B = \\{y | y \\in A \\land y \\in B\\}</math>, it must be the case that <math>x \\not\\in A</math> or <math>x \\not\\in B</math>.\n\nIf <math>x \\not\\in A</math>, then <math>x \\in A^\\complement</math>, so <math>x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>.\n\nSimilarly, if <math>x \\not\\in B</math>, then <math>x \\in B^\\complement</math>, so <math>x \\in A^\\complement\\cup B^\\complement</math>.\n\nThus, <math>\\forall x( x \\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement \\rarr x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement)</math>;\n\nthat is, <math>(A\\cap B)^\\complement \\subseteq A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>.\n\n===Part 2===\n\nTo prove the reverse direction, let <math>x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>, and for contradiction assume <math>x \\not\\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>.\n\nUnder that assumption, it must be the case that <math>x \\in A\\cap B</math>,\n\nso it follows that <math>x \\in A</math> and <math>x \\in B</math>, and thus <math>x \\not\\in A^\\complement</math> and <math>x \\not\\in B^\\complement</math>.\n\nHowever, that means <math>x \\not\\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>, in contradiction to the hypothesis that <math>x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>,\n\ntherefore, the assumption <math>x \\not\\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math> must not be the case, meaning that <math>x \\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>.\n\nHence, <math>\\forall x( x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\rarr x \\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement)</math>,\n\nthat is, <math>A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\subseteq (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>.\n\n===Conclusion===\n\nIf <math>A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\subseteq (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math> ''and'' <math>(A \\cap B)^\\complement \\subseteq A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>, then <math>(A\\cap B)^\\complement = A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>; this concludes the proof of De Morgan's law.\n\nThe other De Morgan's law, <math>(A \\cup B)^\\complement = A^\\complement \\cap B^\\complement</math>, is proven similarly.\n\n==Generalising De Morgan duality==\n[[File:DeMorgan Logic Circuit diagram DIN.svg|thumb|De Morgan's Laws represented as a circuit with logic gates]]\n\nIn extensions of classical propositional logic, the duality still holds (that is, to any logical operator one can always find its dual), since in the presence of the identities governing negation, one may always introduce an operator that is the De Morgan dual of another. This leads to an important property of logics based on [[classical logic]], namely the existence of [[negation normal form]]s: any formula is equivalent to another formula where negations only occur applied to the non-logical atoms of the formula. The existence of negation normal forms drives many applications, for example in [[digital circuit]] design, where it is used to manipulate the types of [[logic gate]]s, and in formal logic, where it is needed to find the [[conjunctive normal form]] and [[disjunctive normal form]] of a formula.  Computer programmers use them to simplify or properly negate complicated [[Conditional (programming)|logical conditions]]. They are also often useful in computations in elementary [[probability theory]].\n\nLet one define the dual of any propositional operator P(''p'', ''q'', ...) depending on elementary propositions ''p'', ''q'', ... to be the operator <math>\\mbox{P}^d</math> defined by\n\n:<math>\\mbox{P}^d(p, q, ...) = \\neg P(\\neg p, \\neg q, \\dots).</math>\n\n==Extension to predicate and modal logic==\n\nThis duality can be generalised to quantifiers, so for example the [[universal quantifier]] and [[existential quantifier]] are duals:\n\n:<math> \\forall x \\, P(x) \\equiv \\neg [ \\exists x \\, \\neg P(x)] </math>\n\n:<math> \\exists x \\, P(x) \\equiv \\neg [ \\forall x \\, \\neg P(x)] </math>\n\nTo relate these quantifier dualities to the De Morgan laws, set up a [[model theory|model]] with some small number of elements in its domain ''D'', such as\n\n:''D'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}.\n\nThen\n\n:<math> \\forall x \\, P(x) \\equiv P(a) \\land P(b) \\land P(c) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\exists x \\, P(x) \\equiv P(a) \\lor P(b) \\lor P(c).</math>\n\nBut, using De Morgan's laws,\n\n:<math> P(a) \\land P(b) \\land P(c) \\equiv \\neg (\\neg P(a) \\lor \\neg P(b) \\lor \\neg P(c)) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> P(a) \\lor P(b) \\lor P(c) \\equiv \\neg (\\neg P(a) \\land \\neg P(b) \\land \\neg P(c)), </math>\n\nverifying the quantifier dualities in the model.\n\nThen, the quantifier dualities can be extended further to [[modal logic]], relating the box (\"necessarily\") and diamond (\"possibly\") operators:\n\n:<math> \\Box p \\equiv \\neg \\Diamond \\neg p, </math>\n:<math> \\Diamond p \\equiv \\neg \\Box \\neg p.</math>\n\nIn its application to the [[alethic modalities]] of possibility and necessity, [[Aristotle]] observed this case, and in the case of [[normal modal logic]], the relationship of these modal operators to the quantification can be understood by setting up models using [[Kripke semantics]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Isomorphism]] \u2013 NOT operator as isomorphism between positive logic and negative logic\n* [[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[Positive logic]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Duality principle|id=p/d034130}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=deMorgansLaws | title=de Morgan's Laws}}\n* {{PlanetMath | urlname=DeMorgansLaws | title=de Morgan's laws | id=2308}}\n\n{{Classical logic}}\n{{Set theory}}\n\n[[Category:Boolean algebra]]\n[[Category:Duality theories]]\n[[Category:Rules of inference]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Theorems in propositional logic]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Demorganlaws.svg|thumb|De Morgan's laws represented with [[Venn diagrams]].

Then, <math>x \\not\\in A \\cap B</math>.\n\nBecause <math>A \\cap B = \\{y | y \\in A \\land y \\in B\\}</math>, it must be the case that <math>x \\not\\in A</math> or <math>x \\not\\in B</math>.\n\nIf <math>x \\not\\in A</math>, then <math>x \\in A^\\complement</math>, so <math>x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>.\n\nSimilarly, if <math>x \\not\\in B</math>, then <math>x \\in B^\\complement</math>, so <math>x \\in A^\\complement\\cup B^\\complement</math>.\n\nThus, <math>\\forall x( x \\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement \\rarr x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement)</math>;\n\nthat is, <math>(A\\cap B)^\\complement \\subseteq A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>.\n\n===Part 2===\n\nTo prove the reverse direction, let <math>x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>, and for contradiction assume <math>x \\not\\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>.\n\nUnder that assumption, it must be the case that <math>x \\in A\\cap B</math>,\n\nso it follows that <math>x \\in A</math> and <math>x \\in B</math>, and thus <math>x \\not\\in A^\\complement</math> and <math>x \\not\\in B^\\complement</math>.\n\nHowever, that means <math>x \\not\\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>, in contradiction to the hypothesis that <math>x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>,\n\ntherefore, the assumption <math>x \\not\\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math> must not be the case, meaning that <math>x \\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>.\n\nHence, <math>\\forall x( x \\in A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\rarr x \\in (A\\cap B)^\\complement)</math>,\n\nthat is, <math>A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\subseteq (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math>.\n\n===Conclusion===\n\nIf <math>A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement \\subseteq (A\\cap B)^\\complement</math> ''and'' <math>(A \\cap B)^\\complement \\subseteq A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>, then <math>(A\\cap B)^\\complement = A^\\complement \\cup B^\\complement</math>; this concludes the proof of De Morgan's law.\n\nThe other De Morgan's law, <math>(A \\cup B)^\\complement = A^\\complement \\cap B^\\complement</math>, is proven similarly.\n\n==Generalising De Morgan duality==\n[[File:DeMorgan Logic Circuit diagram DIN.svg|thumb|De Morgan's Laws represented as a circuit with logic gates]]\n\nIn extensions of classical propositional logic, the duality still holds (that is, to any logical operator one can always find its dual), since in the presence of the identities governing negation, one may always introduce an operator that is the De Morgan dual of another. This leads to an important property of logics based on [[classical logic]], namely the existence of [[negation normal form]]s: any formula is equivalent to another formula where negations only occur applied to the non-logical atoms of the formula. The existence of negation normal forms drives many applications, for example in [[digital circuit]] design, where it is used to manipulate the types of [[logic gate]]s, and in formal logic, where it is needed to find the [[conjunctive normal form]] and [[disjunctive normal form]] of a formula.  Computer programmers use them to simplify or properly negate complicated [[Conditional (programming)|logical conditions]]. They are also often useful in computations in elementary [[probability theory]].\n\nLet one define the dual of any propositional operator P(''p'', ''q'', ...) depending on elementary propositions ''p'', ''q'', ... to be the operator <math>\\mbox{P}^d</math> defined by\n\n:<math>\\mbox{P}^d(p, q, ...) = \\neg P(\\neg p, \\neg q, \\dots).</math>\n\n==Extension to predicate and modal logic==\n\nThis duality can be generalised to quantifiers, so for example the [[universal quantifier]] and [[existential quantifier]] are duals:\n\n:<math> \\forall x \\, P(x) \\equiv \\neg [ \\exists x \\, \\neg P(x)] </math>\n\n:<math> \\exists x \\, P(x) \\equiv \\neg [ \\forall x \\, \\neg P(x)] </math>\n\nTo relate these quantifier dualities to the De Morgan laws, set up a [[model theory|model]] with some small number of elements in its domain ''D'', such as\n\n:''D'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}.\n\nThen\n\n:<math> \\forall x \\, P(x) \\equiv P(a) \\land P(b) \\land P(c) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\exists x \\, P(x) \\equiv P(a) \\lor P(b) \\lor P(c).</math>\n\nBut, using De Morgan's laws,\n\n:<math> P(a) \\land P(b) \\land P(c) \\equiv \\neg (\\neg P(a) \\lor \\neg P(b) \\lor \\neg P(c)) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> P(a) \\lor P(b) \\lor P(c) \\equiv \\neg (\\neg P(a) \\land \\neg P(b) \\land \\neg P(c)), </math>\n\nverifying the quantifier dualities in the model.\n\nThen, the quantifier dualities can be extended further to [[modal logic]], relating the box (\"necessarily\") and diamond (\"possibly\") operators:\n\n:<math> \\Box p \\equiv \\neg \\Diamond \\neg p, </math>\n:<math> \\Diamond p \\equiv \\neg \\Box \\neg p.</math>\n\nIn its application to the [[alethic modalities]] of possibility and necessity, [[Aristotle]] observed this case, and in the case of [[normal modal logic]], the relationship of these modal operators to the quantification can be understood by setting up models using [[Kripke semantics]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Isomorphism]] \u2013 NOT operator as isomorphism between positive logic and negative logic\n* [[List of Boolean algebra topics]]\n* [[Positive logic]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Duality principle|id=p/d034130}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=deMorgansLaws | title=de Morgan's Laws}}\n* {{PlanetMath | urlname=DeMorgansLaws | title=de Morgan's laws | id=2308}}\n\n{{Classical logic}}\n{{Set theory}}\n\n[[Category:Boolean algebra]]\n[[Category:Duality theories]]\n[[Category:Rules of inference]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Theorems in propositional logic]]\n", "name_user": "Paradoctor", "label": "safe", "comment": "caps", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws"}

On July 31, 1667, the English and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] signed the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]], in which for the time being the status quo was respected: the Dutch could keep occupying Suriname and the English the formerly Dutch colony [[New Amsterdam]] (modern-day [[New York (state)|New York]]). Willoughbyland was renamed [[Suriname (Dutch colony)|Suriname]]. This arrangement was made official in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] of 1674, after the English had regained and again lost Suriname in 1667 and the Dutch regained the colony in 1668. In 1683 the [[Society of Suriname]] was set up, modelled on the ideas of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to profit from the management and defence of the [[Dutch Republic]]'s colony. It had three participants, with equal shares in the society's responsibilities and profits\u2014the city of [[Amsterdam]], the family [[Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck]], and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The Van Aerssen family only managed to sell its share in 1770.

The native people proved to be in limited supply and consequently the [[Atlantic slave trade]] supplied the workforce for the plantations.  The plantations were producing [[sugar]], [[coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]] which were exported for the Amsterdam market. In 1713 for instance most of the work on the 200 plantations was done by 13,000 [[Africa]]n slaves. Their treatment was horrific, and slaves periodically escaped to the jungle from the start.<ref>''The Boni Maroon Wars in Suriname'' by Wim S.M. Hoogbergen</ref><ref>Stedman, John Gabriel (1962) ''The Journal of John Gabriel Stedman, 1744-1797, soldier and author, including an authentic account of his expedition to Surinam in 1772'' Mitre Press, London, {{OCLC|924217}}</ref> These ''[[Maroon (people)|Maroons]]'' (also known as \"Djukas\" or \"Bakabusi Nengre\") attacked the plantations in order to acquire goods that were in short supply and to free enslaved women. Notable leaders of the Surinam Maroons were [[Alabi]], [[Boni (guerrilla leader)|Boni]], Joli-coeur and [[Kapitein Broos|Broos]] (Captain Broos). In the 18th century, three of the Maroon people signed a peace treaty, similar to the peace treaty ending the [[First Maroon War]] in Jamaica, whereby they were recognised as free people and received a yearly tribute that provided them with the goods they used to \"liberate\" from the plantations.  A contemporary description of the war between the Maroons and the plantation owners in Suriname can be found in ''Narrative of a Five Years Expedition Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam'' by [[John Gabriel Stedman]].\n\nSuriname was occupied by the British in 1799, after the Netherlands were incorporated by France, and was returned to the Dutch in 1816, after the defeat of [[Napoleon]]. The Dutch abolished slavery only in 1863, although the British had already abolished it during their short rule. The freed slaves were, however, still required to continue their plantation work on a contract basis and were not released until 1873;<ref>https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/timeline-dutch-history/1863-abolition-of-slavery</ref> up to that date they conducted obligatory but paid work at the plantations. In the meantime, many more workers had been imported from the [[Dutch East Indies]], mostly Chinese inhabitants of that colony, creating a [[Chinese Surinamese]] population.  From 1873 to 1916, many laborers were imported from India, creating the [[Indo-Surinamese]]. After 1916, many laborers were again imported from the [[Dutch East Indies]], especially [[Java (island)|Java]], creating the [[Javanese Surinamese]].\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nIn the 20th century, the natural resources of Suriname, [[rubber]], [[gold]] and [[bauxite]], were exploited. The US company [[Alcoa]] had a claim on a large area in Suriname where bauxite, from which aluminum can be made, was found. Given that the peace treaties with the Maroon people granted them title to the lands, there have been international court cases that negated the right of the Surinam government to grant these claims (meaning the right to take the land for themselves).{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} On November 23, 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied Dutch Guiana to protect the bauxite mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html|title=Home|website=faculty.virginia.edu|access-date=2010-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605110034/http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html|archive-date=2011-06-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Decolonization ==\n{{see also|Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)}}\nIn 1945, the first full election was held, with the Netherlands providing aid in health matters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1954, [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|Suriname gained self-government]], with the Netherlands retaining control of defence and foreign affairs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== Independence ==\n[[File:Henck Arron, Beatrix, Johan Ferrier 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Henck Arron]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] and [[Johan Ferrier]] on November 25, 1975]]\n{{see also|Suriname}}\nIn 1973 the Dutch government started independence negotiations with the local government, led by the [[National Party of Suriname|NPS]] (a largely Creole party), which was granted on November 25, 1975. The Dutch instituted an aid programme worth US$1.5 billion to last till 1985. The first President of the country was [[Johan Ferrier]], with [[Henck Arron]] (leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister. Roughly a third of the population emigrated to the Netherlands prior to independence, fearing that the new country would not be viable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, the government of Henck Arron [[1980 Surinamese coup d'\u00e9tat|was overthrown in a military coup]] led by Sergeant-Major [[D\u00e9si Bouterse]]. President Ferrier refused to recognise the new government, appointing [[Henk Chin A Sen]] (of the [[Nationalist Republican Party (Suriname)|Nationalist Republican Party]]). Another coup followed five months later, with the army replacing Ferrier with Chin A Sen. These developments were largely welcomed by a population that expected the new army-installed government to put an end to corruption and improve the standard of living. This was despite the fact that the new regime banned opposition parties and became increasingly dictatorial. The Dutch initially accepted the new government; however, relations between Suriname and the Netherlands collapsed when 15 members of the political opposition were killed by the army on December 8, 1982, in [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Zeelandia]]. This event is also known as the ''[[December murders]]'' (''Decembermoorden'' in Dutch). The Dutch and Americans cut off their aid in protest at the move.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1985, the ban on opposition parties was lifted, and work began on devising a new constitution. The following year saw the start of an anti-government rebellion of the Maroons in the interior, calling themselves the Jungle Commando and led by [[Ronnie Brunswijk]]. The Bouterse government violently tried to suppress the insurgency by burning villages and other similar means. Many Maroons fled to [[French Guiana]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of South America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of colonial heads of Suriname (Netherlands Guiana)]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Suriname]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Suriname]]\n*[[Politics of Suriname]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Gastmann, Albert.

After 1916, many laborers were again imported from the [[Dutch East Indies]], especially [[Java (island)|Java]], creating the [[Javanese Surinamese]].\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nIn the 20th century, the natural resources of Suriname, [[rubber]], [[gold]] and [[bauxite]], were exploited. The US company [[Alcoa]] had a claim on a large area in Suriname where bauxite, from which aluminum can be made, was found. Given that the peace treaties with the Maroon people granted them title to the lands, there have been international court cases that negated the right of the Surinam government to grant these claims (meaning the right to take the land for themselves).{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} On November 23, 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied Dutch Guiana to protect the bauxite mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html|title=Home|website=faculty.virginia.edu|access-date=2010-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605110034/http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html|archive-date=2011-06-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Decolonization ==\n{{see also|Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)}}\nIn 1945, the first full election was held, with the Netherlands providing aid in health matters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1954, [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|Suriname gained self-government]], with the Netherlands retaining control of defence and foreign affairs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== Independence ==\n[[File:Henck Arron, Beatrix, Johan Ferrier 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Henck Arron]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] and [[Johan Ferrier]] on November 25, 1975]]\n{{see also|Suriname}}\nIn 1973 the Dutch government started independence negotiations with the local government, led by the [[National Party of Suriname|NPS]] (a largely Creole party), which was granted on November 25, 1975. The Dutch instituted an aid programme worth US$1.5 billion to last till 1985. The first President of the country was [[Johan Ferrier]], with [[Henck Arron]] (leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister. Roughly a third of the population emigrated to the Netherlands prior to independence, fearing that the new country would not be viable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, the government of Henck Arron [[1980 Surinamese coup d'\u00e9tat|was overthrown in a military coup]] led by Sergeant-Major [[D\u00e9si Bouterse]]. President Ferrier refused to recognise the new government, appointing [[Henk Chin A Sen]] (of the [[Nationalist Republican Party (Suriname)|Nationalist Republican Party]]). Another coup followed five months later, with the army replacing Ferrier with Chin A Sen. These developments were largely welcomed by a population that expected the new army-installed government to put an end to corruption and improve the standard of living. This was despite the fact that the new regime banned opposition parties and became increasingly dictatorial. The Dutch initially accepted the new government; however, relations between Suriname and the Netherlands collapsed when 15 members of the political opposition were killed by the army on December 8, 1982, in [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Zeelandia]]. This event is also known as the ''[[December murders]]'' (''Decembermoorden'' in Dutch). The Dutch and Americans cut off their aid in protest at the move.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1985, the ban on opposition parties was lifted, and work began on devising a new constitution. The following year saw the start of an anti-government rebellion of the Maroons in the interior, calling themselves the Jungle Commando and led by [[Ronnie Brunswijk]]. The Bouterse government violently tried to suppress the insurgency by burning villages and other similar means. Many Maroons fled to [[French Guiana]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of South America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of colonial heads of Suriname (Netherlands Guiana)]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Suriname]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Suriname]]\n*[[Politics of Suriname]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Gastmann, Albert.

She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.
