The club was established in 1947 to play non-professional soccer matches against other teams in the local community until 1959, and 12 years later, they joined the Victorian Soccer Federation (now [[Football Victoria]]), the club's first season in an officially sanctioned competition.<ref name=\"Club History\">{{cite web|title=CLUB HISTORY|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/preston-lions-history/|website=Preston Lions FC|accessdate=3 August 2016}}</ref> The Lions currently compete in the Victorian NPL3 competition after being promoted in 2019, which is the fourth tier in the [[Australian soccer league system]]. The club won the [[Victorian Premier League]] in seasons 1980,1994, 2002 and 2007.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nThe club was founded in 1947 and was affiliated with the Victorian Soccer Federation (now [[Football Victoria]]) in 1959. Based in the suburb of Preston, Victoria, the Macedonia Soccer Club was originally created as a focal point for the newly immigrated Macedonian community to gather and socialise, and to provide the then youth with the opportunity to learn and play the \"world game\" that was so popular back in their homeland of [[ Makedonia]].\n\n===Transformation of the club and affiliation to VSF===\nIn 1959 the club established itself from an amateur club to a semi-professional club, and a change of name to the Preston Makedonia Soccer Club with promotion to the Victorian Division Two (South Competition). Preston Makedonia moved forward in leaps and bounds to become champions of the Victorian Metropolitan League Division One in 1966, and as a result, was promoted to the state's top competition, the Victorian State League in 1967.\n\nThe club first experienced championship success at the state's top level in 1975 and again in 1980. As Victorian champions, Preston Makedonia competed in a play-off against other state champions and in 1981 they were promoted to the then [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) competition.\n\nDuring this significant period of growth the need for much larger facilities became apparent and the club consequently moved from its home base of T.A. Cochrane Reserve in Collier Street, Preston, to its current home ground at [[B.T. Connor Reserve]] in nearby Reservoir. The Preston Lions Social Club was also established around the same time and is located directly opposite the ground.\n\n===National Soccer League===\nPreston Makedonia continued to compete successfully in the NSL for the next 13 years, achieving their best finish in 1987 as runner-up in the Southern Division Championship. In 1992 Preston Makedonia took out the prestigious [[Dockerty Cup]] in a thrilling penalty shootout against arch rivals [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]. However financial difficulties led to poor performances and in 1993 Preston Makedonia played their last match in the NSL.\n\n===Victorian Premier League===\nRelegated to the Victorian Premier League, Preston Makedonia were once again crowned Victorian champions in 1994. Around this time, Soccer Australia forced VPL clubs to abolish any ethnicity associated with their club names. Preston Makedonia Soccer Club was renamed the Preston Lions Soccer Club. The club has since adopted the title of the Preston Lions Football Club, following the lead set by the sports\u2019 governing body and keeping in line with how the game is known in the UK and countries where people don't speak English\u2013as \"football\".\n\nThe club experienced a disastrous campaign in 1995, being relegated to the Victorian State League Division 1 after finishing bottom of the Premier League. Championship winning coach Peter Ollerton was sacked after five games with a record of 1 win, 1 draw and 3 losses to start the '95 campaign.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/P/PrestonLionsMR1995.html</ref> Sean Lane came in on 2 April but lasted just 13 games with a 3\u20135\u20135 record. Norrie Pate oversaw the rest of the campaign as head manager but was unable to avoid the drop. Preston bounced straight back to the Premier League, winning promotion with their 2nd-place finish in the '96 State League 1.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1996D1T.html</ref>\n\nMakedonia would once again become Victorian Premier League champions in both 2002 and 2007, adding to its already impressive collection of trophies. Preston had 3 points deducted at the start of the 2007 season, making the feat all the more impressive. The 2007 grand final at [[Bob Jane Stadium]] against [[Whittlesea Zebras]] was attended by an estimated 4,500 people.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2007PLR.html</ref>\n\n===Recent History===\nIn season 2009, in the club's 50 year anniversary, Preston finished the season in 12th place and were relegated, just two seasons after being crowned VPL Champions. Makedonia managed just 7 points all season in what was one of the worst ever VPL seasons recorded.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2009PLT.html</ref> Preston narrowly avoided relegation in 2010, finishing one point above the relegated [[FC Clifton Hill]], qualifying to the relegation playoff against State League 2 side [[Diamond Valley United]], winning the encounter 1\u20130 through a Robert Najdovski goal.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2010SD1T.html</ref>\n\nPreston's fall from grace was continued in the 2011 State League One season, where the club was not able to avoid relegation, finishing bottom of the table. Makedonia experienced many heavy defeats in the 2011 season, finished with 56 goals conceded, 17 more than any other side in the competition.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2011SD1T.html</ref>\n\nPreston Lions, playing in the third tier of football in Victoria for the first time in over 30 years, had a disappointing 2012 season, finishing mid-table.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2012SD2NWT.html</ref> 2013 was more of the same for the historic outfit, placing 7th in the regionalised Victorian State League 2 North-West.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2013SD2NWT.html</ref>\n\nAfter the inception of the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria]], Preston were \"promoted\" to the Victorian State League 1 North-West, but as the Premier League was split into two divisions, Preston remained at essentially the same tier, the third, as they were before in the Victorian football pyramid.\n\nThe 2014 season saw the Lions manage a 2nd-place finish in the league, missing out on top spot and a State League 1 NW championship by just three points.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2014SD1NWT.html</ref> The club parted ways with head manager [[Josip Biskic]] in May<ref>{{cite web|title=CLUB ANNOUNCEMENT|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/club-announcement/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> and replaced him with Englishman Andy O'Dell. When O'Dell came in after Round 7, Preston were at the bottom end of the ladder. The Lions then went on an incredible run under their new coach, not losing a game for the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Twomey|first1=Liam|title=Cairnlea coach has a point to prove|url=http://www.starweekly.com.au/sports/ffvcairnlea/|website=Star Weekly|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> A landmark moment was achieved when in August 2014, Preston were able to announce that they had eradicated their ATO debt in full,<ref>{{cite web|title=Debt Demolished!!!|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/debt-demolished/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> with acknowledgement arriving form the ATO in September 2014. President Zoran Trajceski resigned at the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidents Report 2014|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/presidents-report-2014/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Lions followed up their 2nd-place finish in 2014 with a 4th-place finish in 2015.<ref>http://www.plfc.com.au/2015-presidents-report/</ref> In June 2015, Andy O\u2019Dell was sacked as head manager following poor results and was replaced by former player \u017deljko Popovi\u0107.<ref>{{cite web|title=COACHING ANNOUNCEMENT|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/coaching-announcement-2/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Popovi\u0107 was initially brought in on an interim basis, but the good results he achieved until the end of the 2015 season saw him reappointed for the 2016 season. The 2016 season saw another runners-up finish in the league for the Lions, finishing six points behind champions [[Altona Magic SC]].\n\nWith one point from three games to start the 2017 State League One season, head coach \u017deljko Popovi\u0107 was replaced by former Preston Lions goalkeeper and former [[Hume City FC]] coach [[Lupce Acevski|Lou Acevski]].<ref name=\"Acevski returns to Preston\">{{cite web|last1=Kulas|first1=Damir|title=Back to the future as Acevski returns to Preston as coach|url=http://www.cornerflag.com.au/back-future-acevski-returns-preston-coach/|website=The Corner Flag|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref> Acevski's first game in charge was an [[FFA Cup]] 5th qualifying round thriller, losing on penalties to fellow State League One North-West side [[North Sunshine Eagles FC]], after the match finished 4\u20134 in extra time. Preston striker Chris Davies scored all four goals for his side, but blazed his penalty over the bar to give the Eagles the win.<ref name=\"Eagles soar in thriller while NPL outfits progress\">{{cite web|last1=Kulas|first1=Damir|title=Eagles soar in thriller while NPL outfits progress|url=http://www.cornerflag.com.au/eagles-soar-thriller-npl-outfits-progress/|website=The Corner Flag|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref> Preston finished the season in fourth place, with Davies' 14 goals enough to clinch the club's golden boot award. [[Robert Stambolziev]] also played eight games for the club, scoring nine goals.\n\nPreston had a poor start to the 2018 season, winning just one of its opening six games. Club returnee [[Naum Sekulovski]] was given the club's captaincy. A late season charge that saw the club go 12 games undefeated, propelling the club from the bottom half to second place, saw the club come in with a chance to challenge [[Geelong SC]] for the title and subsequent promotion to the NPL. In the penultimate game of the 2018 State League 1 season, 3,869 people packed out BT Connor Reserve.{{cn|date=September 2018}} A win would have seen Preston jump Geelong into first place, but the visiting club came away with a 2\u20130 victory, winning the championship. Queenslander Rhys Saunders was Preston's top goalscorer with 14 goals, managing the feat despite arriving mid-season.\n\nMakedonia started the 2019 season with a 7\u20130 win over [[FC Clifton Hill]], a promising sign of things to come. Preston would go undefeated until Round 11 of the season when it went down 4-2 to fellow Macedonian-backed club Sydenham Park SC. However, the club quickly recovered and went on to confirm promotion from State League 1 with a 1\u20130 win over [[Keilor Park SC]]. One week later, Preston claimed the State League 1 North-West championship title with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Banyule City SC|Banyule City]], the club's first league title in 12 years. \n\n==Supporters==\nPreston has typically garnered support from the local Macedonian community across Melbourne but received much support from Macedonians all across Australia when they were competing in the [[National Soccer League|NSL]]. Preston is well known throughout Australian football for having one of the largest and most dedicated supporter bases with crowds in the NSL often exceeding that of 10,000, a large figure for the time. There have been numerous supporter groups throughout the year; including ''Pe\u010dalbari'' from the 1990s who were founded by recent Macedonian immigrants to Australia, many of whom had been involved with ultras groups back home such as [[Komiti Skopje|Komiti]] and [[\u010ckembari]]. Other groups include the ''Lions Pride'' from the early to mid 2000s and the ''Preston Boys'' until around 2011. Today the club is supported by a variety of groups, including the Preston Makedonia Ultras and Lavovi Melbourne.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:PrestonLions final2007

The club was established in 1947 to play non-professional soccer matches against other teams in the local community until 1959, and 12 years later, they joined the Victorian Soccer Federation (now [[Football Victoria]]), the club's first season in an officially sanctioned competition.<ref name=\"Club History\">{{cite web|title=CLUB HISTORY|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/preston-lions-history/|website=Preston Lions FC|accessdate=3 August 2016}}</ref> The Lions currently compete in the Victorian NPL3 competition after being promoted in 2019, which is the fourth tier in the [[Australian soccer league system]]. The club won the [[Victorian Premier League]] in seasons 1980,1994, 2002 and 2007.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nThe club was founded in 1947 and was affiliated with the Victorian Soccer Federation (now [[Football Victoria]]) in 1959. Based in the suburb of Preston, Victoria, the Macedonia Soccer Club was originally created as a focal point for the newly immigrated Macedonian community to gather and socialise, and to provide the then youth with the opportunity to learn and play the \"world game\" that was so popular back in their homeland of [[North_Macedonia|\u039dorth Macedonia]].\n\n===Transformation of the club and affiliation to VSF===\nIn 1959 the club established itself from an amateur club to a semi-professional club, and a change of name to the Preston Makedonia Soccer Club with promotion to the Victorian Division Two (South Competition). Preston Makedonia moved forward in leaps and bounds to become champions of the Victorian Metropolitan League Division One in 1966, and as a result, was promoted to the state's top competition, the Victorian State League in 1967.\n\nThe club first experienced championship success at the state's top level in 1975 and again in 1980. As Victorian champions, Preston Makedonia competed in a play-off against other state champions and in 1981 they were promoted to the then [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) competition.\n\nDuring this significant period of growth the need for much larger facilities became apparent and the club consequently moved from its home base of T.A. Cochrane Reserve in Collier Street, Preston, to its current home ground at [[B.T. Connor Reserve]] in nearby Reservoir. The Preston Lions Social Club was also established around the same time and is located directly opposite the ground.\n\n===National Soccer League===\nPreston Makedonia continued to compete successfully in the NSL for the next 13 years, achieving their best finish in 1987 as runner-up in the Southern Division Championship. In 1992 Preston Makedonia took out the prestigious [[Dockerty Cup]] in a thrilling penalty shootout against arch rivals [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]. However financial difficulties led to poor performances and in 1993 Preston Makedonia played their last match in the NSL.\n\n===Victorian Premier League===\nRelegated to the Victorian Premier League, Preston Makedonia were once again crowned Victorian champions in 1994. Around this time, Soccer Australia forced VPL clubs to abolish any ethnicity associated with their club names. Preston Makedonia Soccer Club was renamed the Preston Lions Soccer Club. The club has since adopted the title of the Preston Lions Football Club, following the lead set by the sports\u2019 governing body and keeping in line with how the game is known in the UK and countries where people don't speak English\u2013as \"football\".\n\nThe club experienced a disastrous campaign in 1995, being relegated to the Victorian State League Division 1 after finishing bottom of the Premier League. Championship winning coach Peter Ollerton was sacked after five games with a record of 1 win, 1 draw and 3 losses to start the '95 campaign.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/P/PrestonLionsMR1995.html</ref> Sean Lane came in on 2 April but lasted just 13 games with a 3\u20135\u20135 record. Norrie Pate oversaw the rest of the campaign as head manager but was unable to avoid the drop. Preston bounced straight back to the Premier League, winning promotion with their 2nd-place finish in the '96 State League 1.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/1996D1T.html</ref>\n\nMakedonia would once again become Victorian Premier League champions in both 2002 and 2007, adding to its already impressive collection of trophies. Preston had 3 points deducted at the start of the 2007 season, making the feat all the more impressive. The 2007 grand final at [[Bob Jane Stadium]] against [[Whittlesea Zebras]] was attended by an estimated 4,500 people.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2007PLR.html</ref>\n\n===Recent History===\nIn season 2009, in the club's 50 year anniversary, Preston finished the season in 12th place and were relegated, just two seasons after being crowned VPL Champions. Makedonia managed just 7 points all season in what was one of the worst ever VPL seasons recorded.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2009PLT.html</ref> Preston narrowly avoided relegation in 2010, finishing one point above the relegated [[FC Clifton Hill]], qualifying to the relegation playoff against State League 2 side [[Diamond Valley United]], winning the encounter 1\u20130 through a Robert Najdovski goal.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2010SD1T.html</ref>\n\nPreston's fall from grace was continued in the 2011 State League One season, where the club was not able to avoid relegation, finishing bottom of the table. Makedonia experienced many heavy defeats in the 2011 season, finished with 56 goals conceded, 17 more than any other side in the competition.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2011SD1T.html</ref>\n\nPreston Lions, playing in the third tier of football in Victoria for the first time in over 30 years, had a disappointing 2012 season, finishing mid-table.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2012SD2NWT.html</ref> 2013 was more of the same for the historic outfit, placing 7th in the regionalised Victorian State League 2 North-West.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2013SD2NWT.html</ref>\n\nAfter the inception of the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria]], Preston were \"promoted\" to the Victorian State League 1 North-West, but as the Premier League was split into two divisions, Preston remained at essentially the same tier, the third, as they were before in the Victorian football pyramid.\n\nThe 2014 season saw the Lions manage a 2nd-place finish in the league, missing out on top spot and a State League 1 NW championship by just three points.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/States/VIC/2014SD1NWT.html</ref> The club parted ways with head manager [[Josip Biskic]] in May<ref>{{cite web|title=CLUB ANNOUNCEMENT|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/club-announcement/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> and replaced him with Englishman Andy O'Dell. When O'Dell came in after Round 7, Preston were at the bottom end of the ladder. The Lions then went on an incredible run under their new coach, not losing a game for the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Twomey|first1=Liam|title=Cairnlea coach has a point to prove|url=http://www.starweekly.com.au/sports/ffvcairnlea/|website=Star Weekly|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> A landmark moment was achieved when in August 2014, Preston were able to announce that they had eradicated their ATO debt in full,<ref>{{cite web|title=Debt Demolished!!!|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/debt-demolished/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> with acknowledgement arriving form the ATO in September 2014. President Zoran Trajceski resigned at the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidents Report 2014|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/presidents-report-2014/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Lions followed up their 2nd-place finish in 2014 with a 4th-place finish in 2015.<ref>http://www.plfc.com.au/2015-presidents-report/</ref> In June 2015, Andy O\u2019Dell was sacked as head manager following poor results and was replaced by former player \u017deljko Popovi\u0107.<ref>{{cite web|title=COACHING ANNOUNCEMENT|url=http://www.plfc.com.au/coaching-announcement-2/|website=Preston Lions F.C.|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Popovi\u0107 was initially brought in on an interim basis, but the good results he achieved until the end of the 2015 season saw him reappointed for the 2016 season. The 2016 season saw another runners-up finish in the league for the Lions, finishing six points behind champions [[Altona Magic SC]].\n\nWith one point from three games to start the 2017 State League One season, head coach \u017deljko Popovi\u0107 was replaced by former Preston Lions goalkeeper and former [[Hume City FC]] coach [[Lupce Acevski|Lou Acevski]].<ref name=\"Acevski returns to Preston\">{{cite web|last1=Kulas|first1=Damir|title=Back to the future as Acevski returns to Preston as coach|url=http://www.cornerflag.com.au/back-future-acevski-returns-preston-coach/|website=The Corner Flag|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref> Acevski's first game in charge was an [[FFA Cup]] 5th qualifying round thriller, losing on penalties to fellow State League One North-West side [[North Sunshine Eagles FC]], after the match finished 4\u20134 in extra time. Preston striker Chris Davies scored all four goals for his side, but blazed his penalty over the bar to give the Eagles the win.<ref name=\"Eagles soar in thriller while NPL outfits progress\">{{cite web|last1=Kulas|first1=Damir|title=Eagles soar in thriller while NPL outfits progress|url=http://www.cornerflag.com.au/eagles-soar-thriller-npl-outfits-progress/|website=The Corner Flag|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref> Preston finished the season in fourth place, with Davies' 14 goals enough to clinch the club's golden boot award. [[Robert Stambolziev]] also played eight games for the club, scoring nine goals.\n\nPreston had a poor start to the 2018 season, winning just one of its opening six games. Club returnee [[Naum Sekulovski]] was given the club's captaincy. A late season charge that saw the club go 12 games undefeated, propelling the club from the bottom half to second place, saw the club come in with a chance to challenge [[Geelong SC]] for the title and subsequent promotion to the NPL. In the penultimate game of the 2018 State League 1 season, 3,869 people packed out BT Connor Reserve.{{cn|date=September 2018}} A win would have seen Preston jump Geelong into first place, but the visiting club came away with a 2\u20130 victory, winning the championship. Queenslander Rhys Saunders was Preston's top goalscorer with 14 goals, managing the feat despite arriving mid-season.\n\nMakedonia started the 2019 season with a 7\u20130 win over [[FC Clifton Hill]], a promising sign of things to come. Preston would go undefeated until Round 11 of the season when it went down 4-2 to fellow Macedonian-backed club Sydenham Park SC. However, the club quickly recovered and went on to confirm promotion from State League 1 with a 1\u20130 win over [[Keilor Park SC]]. One week later, Preston claimed the State League 1 North-West championship title with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Banyule City SC|Banyule City]], the club's first league title in 12 years. \n\n==Supporters==\nPreston has typically garnered support from the local Macedonian community across Melbourne but received much support from Macedonians all across Australia when they were competing in the [[National Soccer League|NSL]]. Preston is well known throughout Australian football for having one of the largest and most dedicated supporter bases with crowds in the NSL often exceeding that of 10,000, a large figure for the time. There have been numerous supporter groups throughout the year; including ''Pe\u010dalbari'' from the 1990s who were founded by recent Macedonian immigrants to Australia, many of whom had been involved with ultras groups back home such as [[Komiti Skopje|Komiti]] and [[\u010ckembari]]. Other groups include the ''Lions Pride'' from the early to mid 2000s and the ''Preston Boys'' until around 2011. Today the club is supported by a variety of groups, including the Preston Makedonia Ultras and Lavovi Melbourne.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:PrestonLions final2007

When he was three, his family moved to [[Sheffield]] in England. He was educated in Sheffield at [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII School]] where he was Head Prefect in 1951 ([http://oldedwardians.org.uk/nlc/prefects49-50.html photo]), before going up to [[New College, Oxford]], with an Open Scholarship in Classics.\n\nHe joined [[BBC Radio]] on graduating in 1955 from the [[University of Oxford]].

A few months later, George MacBeth was diagnosed as suffering from [[motor neurone disease]], of which he died in early 1992.

{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

Shore and Maritime when in fact it was Newton who were supposed to be the opponent.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions.

As a result, some of the scoring lists are inaccurate. For example, George Isles was known to have scored 5 tries however 6 other tries were attributed to \"Isles\" which may have been him or his brother A Isles. Likewise City Rovers featured [[George Paki]] and his brother B Paki. B Paki was attributed a try while \"Paki\" scored 2 tries, while for Ponsonby L Cadman scored 1, A Cadman scored 2, and \"Cadman\" scored 3.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

WrestleMania's matches were filmed at the Performance Center on March 25 and 26, while two matches were filmed in atypical styles outside of WWE's traditional arena setting.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a [[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]], and [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] in the final match from the Performance Center. In other prominent matches, [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]].\n\nIn the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]] defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]] after which, McIntyre defeated [[Paul Wight|Big Show]] to retain the WWE Championship in a dark match (this match was later shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a [[no disqualification match|Firefly Fun House match]], [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 was positively received by fans and critics; while all agreed that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations, with the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches being singled out as the best ones for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. They eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge would perform a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. Edge then performed a Conchairto with another chair on Orton. Orton could not answer the referees 10 count, thus Edge won the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion, Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a Fatal Five-Way Elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi and Tamina. Tamina was the first competitor eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Naomi was next eliminated by Sasha Banks after submitting to the Bank Statement. Next, Bayley accidentally pushed Banks into the way of Lacey Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the title.\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring, however, he was teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After being teleported, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s demonstrating his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt reprising [[Kurt Angle]]'s promo against Cena from the episode, and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", tired out from lifting weights). After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show (wrestler)|Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.<ref name=BSMATCH/> The match aired on the April 6 episode of ''Raw''.<ref name=BSTIME/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe event was positively received by fans and critics. While all agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, most felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013; while praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that \"Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler['s match was] a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium. But there was a lot of shoddy storytelling going into this year\u2019s show. It\u2019s great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn\u2019t just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a blood money PPV in Saudi Arabia\u2014and, you know, done ''anything'' with Braun over the past few years.<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest ''Wrestlemania'' of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |publisher=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn\u2019t actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital-P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onwards was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, Night One was really strong overall\", although he found Night Two much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even ''longer'' match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" He considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches of the night.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' stated: \"WrestleMania felt disjointed and hollow at times without an audience, but there were still standout moments and matches for fans to enjoy from home.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|caption = Part 1 (April 4) results \n|times = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1= [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. In addition to the WWE Network, the two productions were sold as individual PPVs, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present. WWE subsequently announced that WrestleMania would also be presented from the facility, and air across two nights. WrestleMania's matches were filmed at the Performance Center on March 25 and 26, while two matches were filmed in atypical styles outside of WWE's traditional arena setting.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a [[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]], and [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] in the final match from the Performance Center. In other prominent matches, [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]].\n\nIn the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]] defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]] after which, McIntyre defeated [[Paul Wight|Big Show]] to retain the WWE Championship in a dark match (this match was later shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a [[no disqualification match|Firefly Fun House match]], [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 was positively received by fans and critics; while all agreed that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations, with the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches being singled out as the best ones for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. They eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge would perform a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. Edge then performed a Conchairto with another chair on Orton. Orton could not answer the referees 10 count, thus Edge won the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion, Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a Fatal Five-Way Elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi and Tamina. Tamina was the first competitor eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Naomi was next eliminated by Sasha Banks after submitting to the Bank Statement. Next, Bayley accidentally pushed Banks into the way of Lacey Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the title.\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring, however, he was teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After being teleported, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s demonstrating his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt reprising [[Kurt Angle]]'s promo against Cena from the episode, and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", tired out from lifting weights). After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

But there was a lot of shoddy storytelling going into this year\u2019s show. It\u2019s great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn\u2019t just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a blood money PPV in Saudi Arabia\u2014and, you know, done ''anything'' with Braun over the past few years.<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest ''Wrestlemania'' of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |publisher=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn\u2019t actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital-P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onwards was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, Night One was really strong overall\", although he found Night Two much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even ''longer'' match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" He considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches of the night.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' stated: \"WrestleMania felt disjointed and hollow at times without an audience, but there were still standout moments and matches for fans to enjoy from home.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|caption = Part 1 (April 4) results \n|times = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1= [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

The modern form of the word derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word for an idol made of sand - [[Valuka Iswar]],<ref>[http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/architecture/building/walkeshwar.html Walkeshwar Temple]</ref> an avatar of Shiva - in a legend celebrated at the [[Walkeshwar Temple]], situated at the highest point of the city.<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/v/019pho000000937u00009000.html Walkeshwar village] ''[[British Library]]''.</ref>\n\n==Legend==\nLegend has it that [[Hindu]] god, [[Rama|Ram]] paused at that spot on his way from [[Ayodhya]] to [[Lanka]] in pursuit of the demon king, [[Ravana]] who had kidnapped his wife, [[Sita]]. Then [[Lord Rama]] was advised to worship [[Linga|Shiv linga]] and he is said to have constructed the original [[linga]] of sand, after getting tired of waiting for his brother, [[Lakshman]] to bring an idol. The name is etymologically derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word for an idol made of sand -- ''[[Valuka Iswar]]'', an [[Avatar]] of [[Shiva]].\n\nAs the story progresses, later when Ram was thirsty, as there was no fresh water readily available (only sea water), he shot an arrow and brought [[Ganges]] over here. Hence ''Bana'' (arrow in Sanskrit) ''[[Ganges]]''.  The water that feeds the tank stems from an underground spring at that spot, despite its proximity to the sea.\n\n==Overview==\nWalkeshwar also includes [[Malabar Hill]], and is in close proximity to the [[Hanging Gardens of Mumbai|Hanging Gardens]].

The modern form of the word derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word for an idol made of sand - [[Valuka Iswar]],<ref>[http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/architecture/building/walkeshwar.html Walkeshwar Temple]</ref> an avatar of Shiva - in a legend celebrated at the [[Walkeshwar Temple]], situated at the highest point of the city.<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/v/019pho000000937u00009000.html Walkeshwar village] ''[[British Library]]''.</ref>\n\n==Legend==\nLegend has it that [[Hindu]] god, [[Rama|Ram]] paused at that spot on his way from [[Ayodhya]] to [[Lanka]] in pursuit of the demon king, [[Ravana]] who had kidnapped his wife, [[Sita]]. Then [[Lord Rama]] was advised to worship [[Linga|Shiv linga]] and he is said to have constructed the original [[linga]] of sand, after getting tired of waiting for his brother, [[Lakshman]] to bring an idol. The name is etymologically derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word for an idol made of sand -- ''[[Valuka Iswar]]'', an [[Avatar]] of [[Shiva]].\n\nAs the story progresses, later when Ram was thirsty, as there was no fresh water readily available (only sea water), he shot an arrow and brought [[Ganges]] over here. Hence ''Bana'' (arrow in Sanskrit) ''[[Ganges]]''.  The water that feeds the tank stems from an underground spring at that spot, despite its proximity to the sea.\n\n==Overview==\nWalkeshwar also includes [[Malabar Hill]], and is in close proximity to the [[Hanging Gardens of Mumbai|Hanging Gardens]].

She was the cousin of Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]], commander of the S.S. Roosevelt and the [[HMCS Karluk|S.S. Karluk]]. All of her relatives on her father's side for generations were sailors. Her grandfather's generation included nine sailing masters or captains. Tapley's mother's name was Elizabeth Stagg Riker. She was the granddaughter of Abram Polhemus, one of the founders of the old [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in [[New York City]]. He was a merchant marine prince as a young man. Tapley was educated in the public schools of [[Malden, Massachusetts]] and at [[Boston University]].\n\n==Career==\nTapley performed on stage from 1900 to 1909. Her first theatrical engagement was with the Myron B. Rice Company, as ''Bernice'', in ''My Friend From India''. During the season of 1900 she played every other woman's part in this play.  She starred with popular actors of the era such as [[Richard Mansfield]], [[Chauncey Olcott]], [[E.H. Sothern]], and J.H. Stoddard. With Mansfield, Rose acted in ''Beau Brummel'', ''Monsieur Beaucaire'', ''A Parisian Romance'', and ''First Violin''. One of her most noted roles was in ''The Sign of the Cross''.\n\nHer first motion picture appearance was in 1905. Tapley was featured in the [[Thomas Alva Edison]] film, ''Wanted a Wife''. Soon after she performed in the first standard two reeler, ''The Money Kings''. She signed a contract with the old [[Vitagraph]] Company in May 1909, making her the first ''[[leading lady]]'' of movies. She was also the first star of the stage to begin a film career. She acted with Vitagraph, [[Famous Players-Lasky]], and for [[Fox Film]] until her retirement in 1931. Her credits number 175 films. Some of the titles are ''The Way of the Cross'' (1909), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1909 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1909), ''The Cave Man'' (1912), ''Every Inch A Man'' (1912), ''[[Seeing Double (1913 film)|Seeing Double]]'' (1913), ''[[One Can't Always Tell]]'' (1913), ''Mr. Jarr and the Society Circus'' (1915), ''Her Majesty'' (1922), ''God's Great Wilderness'' (1927), ''His First Command'' (1929), and ''[[Resurrection (1931 English-language film)|Resurrection]]'' (1931).\n\nTapley was frequently called the ''Mother of Movies''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Picture Pioneer Turns To Stage|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/161713248.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+21%2C+1925&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281923-Current+File%29&edition=&startpage=&desc=PICTURE+PIONEER+TURNS+TO+STAGE|work=LA Times|date=June 21, 1925|page=18}}</ref> She served as official hostess at a number of motion picture expositions at different locales throughout the country. In 1916\u20131917 Rose toured America as a representative of the film industry. She made appearances in front of state legislatures, businesses, and women's clubs.

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago has been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate, but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones found in the 1870s provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach.

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago have been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate; but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones found in the 1870s provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach.

This activates keratinocyte IGF receptors, particularly [[IGF-1]]. At high concentrations, insulin may also displace IGF-1 from [[insulin-like growth factor-binding protein]] (IGFBP). Increased circulating IGF may lead to keratinocyte and dermal [[fibroblast]] proliferation.<ref name=HIGGINS2008/>\n* In hereditary forms of acanthosis nigricans, [[fibroblast growth factor receptor]] (FGFR) defects<ref name=HIGGINS2008/>\n* Increased [[transforming growth factor]] (TGF), which appears to be the mechanism for malignancy-associated acanthosis nigricans.

This is most commonly [[insulin]]-mediated activation of [[IGF receptors]] on [[keratinocytes]], as a result of [[hyperinsulinaemia]] or [[insulin resistance]], as seen in [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=HIGGINS2008>{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=SP|author2=Freemark, M|author3= Prose, NS|title=Acanthosis nigricans: a practical approach to evaluation and management.|journal=Dermatology Online Journal|date=Sep 15, 2008|volume=14|issue=9|pages=2|pmid=19061584}}</ref>\n\nFactors involved in the development of acanthosis nigricans include:\n* Increased circulating insulin. This activates keratinocyte IGF receptors, particularly [[IGF-1]]. At high concentrations, insulin may also displace IGF-1 from [[insulin-like growth factor-binding protein]] (IGFBP). Increased circulating IGF may lead to keratinocyte and dermal [[fibroblast]] proliferation.<ref name=HIGGINS2008/>\n* In hereditary forms of acanthosis nigricans, [[fibroblast growth factor receptor]] (FGFR) defects<ref name=HIGGINS2008/>\n* Increased [[transforming growth factor]] (TGF), which appears to be the mechanism for malignancy-associated acanthosis nigricans. TGF acts on epidermal tissue via the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR).<ref name=FITZPATRICK2005/>{{rp|86}}\n\nIn conjunction with increased end levels of IGF, it is likely that perspiration and friction may be necessary predeterminants for lesions, since the level of insulin is usually not enough to activate IGF receptors across the body.<ref name=HIGGINS2008/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nAcanthosis nigricans is typically diagnosed clinically.<ref name=HABIF2009 /> A skin biopsy may be needed in unusual cases. If no clear cause is obvious, it may be necessary to search for one. Blood tests, an [[endoscopy]], or [[X-ray]]s may be required to eliminate the possibility of [[diabetes]] or [[cancer]] as the cause.<ref name=FITZPATRICK2005 />{{rp|87}}\n\nOn biopsy, hyperkeratosis, epidermal folding, leukocyte infiltration, and melanocyte proliferation may be seen.<ref name=HABIF2009 />{{rp|979}}<ref name=FITZPATRICK2005 />{{rp|87}}\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nAcanthosis nigricans should be distinguished from the [[casal collar]] appearing in [[pellagra]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n===Classification===\nAcanthosis nigricans is conventionally divided into benign and malignant forms,<ref name=HABIF2009>{{cite book|last=Habif|first=Thomas P.|title=Clinical dermatology|year=2009|publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7234-3541-9|edition=5th}}</ref><ref name=DERMNZ>{{cite web|last=Ngan|first=Vanessa|title=Acanthosis nigricans|url=http://dermnetnz.org/systemic/acanthosis-nigricans.html|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref> although may be divided into syndromes according to cause:<ref name=ANDREWS2006>James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

This may include forms that are associated with tumour products and insulin-like activity, or [[tumour necrosis factor]].<ref name=HABIF2009 />\n\nAn alternate classification system still used to describe acanthosis nigricans was proposed in 1994. It delineates acanthosis nigricans syndromes according to their associated syndromes, including benign and malignant forms, forms associated with obesity and drugs, acral acanthosis nigricans, unilateral acanthosis nigricans, and mixed and syndromic forms.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Acanthosis nigricans vulgaris.

Controlling [[blood glucose]] levels through exercise and diet often improves symptoms. Topical fade creams (normally used for eliminating age spots) can lighten skin cosmetically in less severe cases. Selenium Sulfide topical 2 percent applied in thin layer to dry skin ten minutes prior to bathing may clear symptoms. Selenium Sulfide applied to dry scalp or skin is an inexpensive well tolerated treatment to balance skin's biome and works by drying fungus like tinea versicolor that can coexist with Acanthosis and exacerbate discoloration. Acanthosis nigricans maligna may resolve if the causative tumor is successfully removed.<ref name = brown>{{cite journal | author = Brown J | author2 = Winkelmann RK | title = Acanthosis nigricans: study of 90 cases | journal = Medicine | year = 1968 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201351 | pmid = 4868603 | doi=10.1097/00005792-196801000-00002}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nAcanthosis nigricans is likely to improve in circumstances where a known cause is removed. For example, obesity-related acanthosis nigricans will improve with weight loss, and drug-induced acanthosis nigricans is likely to resolve when the drug is ceased. Hereditary variants may or may not fade with age, and malignancy-associated variants may, after a malignancy is removed, fade.<ref name=FITZPATRICK2005 /> {{rp|87}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 58\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|L|83||l|80}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|701.2}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 100600\n| MedlinePlus     = 000852\n| eMedicineSubj   = derm\n| eMedicineTopic  = 1\n| MeshID          = D000052\n| SNOMED CT       = 402599005\n}}\n{{Commons category|Acanthosis nigricans}}\n\n* {{Chorus|00001}}\n\n{{Pigmentation disorders}}\n{{Cutaneous ketatosis, ulcer, atrophy, and necrobiosis}}\n{{Paraneoplastic syndromes}}\n\n[[Category:Endocrine-related cutaneous conditions]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Medical conditions related to obesity]]\n", "name_user": "210.56.122.161", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eType IV \u2013 drug-related)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthosis_nigricans"}
