Bolko II assumed full government over his domains in 1323, and made the formal division of the Duchy with his brother Albert: he received [[Strzelce Opolskie]] and Bolko II retained the main city of Opole.\n\nThanks to his marriage to Elisabeth, daughter of Duke [[Bernard of \u015awidnica]], Bolko II had a temporary close connection with the Polish King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] (paternal grandfather of his wife).

It was also observed that irreversible oxidation of [[cytochrome]]s paralleled the loss of respiratory activity. One way of addressing the loss of oxygen uptake was by studying the effects of HOCl on succinate-dependent [[electron transport]].<ref name=ref43>{{cite journal|last1=Hurst|first1=JK|last2=Barrette Jr|first2=WC|last3=Michel|first3=BR|last4=Rosen|first4=H|title=Hypochlorous acid and myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of iron-sulfur clusters in bacterial respiratory dehydrogenases|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry / FEBS|volume=202|issue=3|pages=1275\u201382|year=1991|pmid=1662610|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16500.x}}</ref> Rosen ''et al.''<ref name=ref79/> found that levels of reductable [[cytochrome]]s in HOCl-treated cells were normal, and these cells were unable to reduce them. Succinate dehydrogenase was also inhibited by HOCl, stopping the flow of electrons to oxygen. Later studies<ref name=ref71/> revealed that Ubiquinol oxidase activity ceases first, and the still-active [[cytochrome]]s reduce the remaining quinone. The [[cytochrome]]s then pass the [[electron]]s to [[oxygen]], which explains why the [[cytochrome]]s cannot be reoxidized, as observed by Rosen ''et al.''<ref name=ref79/> However, this line of inquiry was ended when Albrich ''et al.''<ref name=albrich/> found that cellular inactivation precedes loss of respiration by using a flow mixing system that allowed evaluation of viability on much smaller time scales. This group found that cells capable of respiring could not divide after exposure to HOCl.\n\n===Depletion of adenine nucleotides===\nHaving eliminated loss of respiration, Albrich ''et al.''<ref name=albrich/> proposes that the cause of death may be due to metabolic dysfunction caused by depletion of adenine nucleotides. Barrette ''et al.''<ref name=ref8/> studied the loss of adenine nucleotides by studying the energy charge of HOCl-exposed cells and found that cells exposed to HOCl were unable to step up their energy charge after addition of nutrients. The conclusion was that exposed cells have lost the ability to regulate their adenylate pool, based on the fact that metabolite uptake was only 45% deficient after exposure to HOCl and the observation that HOCl causes intracellular ATP hydrolysis. It was also confirmed that, at bacteriocidal levels of HOCl, cytosolic components are unaffected. So it was proposed that modification of some membrane-bound protein results in extensive ATP hydrolysis, and this, coupled with the cells inability to remove AMP from the cytosol, depresses metabolic function. One protein involved in loss of ability to regenerate ATP has been found to be [[ATP synthetase]].<ref name=ref9/> Much of this research on respiration reconfirms the observation that relevant bacteriocidal reactions take place at the cell membrane.<ref name=ref9/><ref name=ref8/><ref name=ref75>{{cite journal|last1=Rosen|first1=H|last2=Klebanoff|first2=SJ|title=Oxidation of ''Escherichia coli'' iron centers by the myeloperoxidase-mediated microbicidal system|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=257|issue=22|pages=13731\u201335|year=1982|pmid=6292201}}</ref>\n\n===Inhibition of DNA replication===\nRecently it has been proposed that bacterial inactivation by HOCl is the result of inhibition of [[DNA]] replication.

Albrich ''et al.''<ref name=ref3/> subsequently found that HOCl destroys [[cytochrome]]s and [[iron-sulfur cluster]]s and observed that oxygen uptake is abolished by HOCl and adenine nucleotides are lost. It was also observed that irreversible oxidation of [[cytochrome]]s paralleled the loss of respiratory activity. One way of addressing the loss of oxygen uptake was by studying the effects of HOCl on succinate-dependent [[electron transport]].<ref name=ref43>{{cite journal|last1=Hurst|first1=JK|last2=Barrette Jr|first2=WC|last3=Michel|first3=BR|last4=Rosen|first4=H|title=Hypochlorous acid and myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of iron-sulfur clusters in bacterial respiratory dehydrogenases|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry / FEBS|volume=202|issue=3|pages=1275\u201382|year=1991|pmid=1662610|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16500.x}}</ref> Rosen ''et al.''<ref name=ref79/> found that levels of reductable [[cytochrome]]s in HOCl-treated cells were normal, and these cells were unable to reduce them. Succinate dehydrogenase was also inhibited by HOCl, stopping the flow of electrons to oxygen. Later studies<ref name=ref71/> revealed that Ubiquinol oxidase activity ceases first, and the still-active [[cytochrome]]s reduce the remaining quinone. The [[cytochrome]]s then pass the [[electron]]s to [[oxygen]], which explains why the [[cytochrome]]s cannot be reoxidized, as observed by Rosen ''et al.''<ref name=ref79/> However, this line of inquiry was ended when Albrich ''et al.''<ref name=albrich/> found that cellular inactivation precedes loss of respiration by using a flow mixing system that allowed evaluation of viability on much smaller time scales. This group found that cells capable of respiring could not divide after exposure to HOCl.\n\n===Depletion of adenine nucleotides===\nHaving eliminated loss of respiration, Albrich ''et al.''<ref name=albrich/> proposes that the cause of death may be due to metabolic dysfunction caused by depletion of adenine nucleotides. Barrette ''et al.''<ref name=ref8/> studied the loss of adenine nucleotides by studying the energy charge of HOCl-exposed cells and found that cells exposed to HOCl were unable to step up their energy charge after addition of nutrients. The conclusion was that exposed cells have lost the ability to regulate their adenylate pool, based on the fact that metabolite uptake was only 45% deficient after exposure to HOCl and the observation that HOCl causes intracellular ATP hydrolysis. It was also confirmed that, at bacteriocidal levels of HOCl, cytosolic components are unaffected. So it was proposed that modification of some membrane-bound protein results in extensive ATP hydrolysis, and this, coupled with the cells inability to remove AMP from the cytosol, depresses metabolic function. One protein involved in loss of ability to regenerate ATP has been found to be [[ATP synthetase]].<ref name=ref9/> Much of this research on respiration reconfirms the observation that relevant bacteriocidal reactions take place at the cell membrane.<ref name=ref9/><ref name=ref8/><ref name=ref75>{{cite journal|last1=Rosen|first1=H|last2=Klebanoff|first2=SJ|title=Oxidation of ''Escherichia coli'' iron centers by the myeloperoxidase-mediated microbicidal system|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=257|issue=22|pages=13731\u201335|year=1982|pmid=6292201}}</ref>\n\n===Inhibition of DNA replication===\nRecently it has been proposed that bacterial inactivation by HOCl is the result of inhibition of [[DNA]] replication.

Rosen\u2019s group proposed that inactivation of membrane proteins involved in DNA replication are the mechanism of action of HOCl.\n\n===Protein unfolding and aggregation===\nHOCl is known to cause post-translational modifications to [[proteins]], the notable ones being [[cysteine]] and [[methionine]] oxidation. A recent examination of HOCl's bactericidal role revealed it to be a potent inducer of protein aggregation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Winter|first1=J.|last2=Ilbert|first2=M.|last3=Graf|first3=P.C.F.|last4=\u00d6zcelik|first4=D.|last5=Jakob|first5=U.|title=Bleach Activates a Redox-Regulated Chaperone by Oxidative Protein Unfolding|journal=Cell|volume=135|issue=4|pages=691\u2013701|year=2008|pmid=19013278|pmc=2606091|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.024}}</ref> Hsp33, a chaperone known to be activated by oxidative heat stress, protects bacteria from the effects of HOCl by acting as a [[holdase]], effectively preventing protein aggregation. Strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl. Hsp33 protected many essential proteins from aggregation and inactivation due to HOCl, which is a probable mediator of HOCl's bactericidal effects.\n\n==Hypochlorites==\n{{Main|Hypochlorite}}\nHypochlorites are the salts of hypochlorous acid; commercially important hypochlorites are [[calcium hypochlorite]] and [[sodium hypochlorite]].\n\n===Production of hypochlorites using electrolysis===\n{{See also|Chloralkali process}}\nSolutions of hypochlorites can be produced by electrolysis of an aqueous chloride solution. The composition of the resulting solution depends on the pH at the anode.  In acid conditions the solution produced will have a high hypochlorous acid concentration, but will also contain dissolved gaseous chlorine, which can be corrosive, at a neutral pH the solution will be around 75% hypochlorous acid and 25% hypochlorite. Some of the chlorine gas produced will dissolve forming hypochlorite ions. Hypochlorites are also produced by the [[disproportionation]] of chlorine gas in alkaline solutions.\n\n==Safety==\nHOCl is a strong oxidising agent.\n\n==Uses of Hypochlorous Acid==\nHypochlorous acid has been investigated as a possible wound care agent,<ref>Wang L et al. \"Hypochlorous acid as a potential wound care agent.
