Its symbol was a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Dominican Party was founded on 2 August 1931, a year after Trujillo came to power. It was an outgrowth of the \"Patriotic Coalition of Citizens\" that supported Trujillo's run for president. Soon afterward, it was proclaimed to be the only legal party.\n\nOn 16 August 1935, the HIN radio station, known as \"The Voice of the Dominican Party\", was opened. It was dedicated to serving as the media propagator of the activities of the Dominican Party.\n\nThe insignia of the Party had a motto that coincided with Trujillo's initials:\n\n*'''R'''ectitud (Righteousness) = Rafael\n*'''L'''ibertad (Freedom; Liberty) = Leonidas\n*'''T'''rabajo (Work; Labour; Job) = Trujillo.\n\nLater, he added: '''M'''oralidad (Morality) = Molina.\n\nOfficially, Trujillo was only president from 1930 until 1938 and from 1942 until 1952, and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1953 until 1961.  However, for 30 years he held the real power as leader of the Dominican Party and [[Generalissimo]] of the [[Dominican Army]]. In these roles, he was able to ensure that when he was not actually president, the position was held by family members or politicians allied to him: [[Jacinto Peynado]] (President from 1938 until 1940), [[Manuel de Jes\u00fas Troncoso de la Concha]] (President from 1940 until 1942), his brother [[H\u00e9ctor Trujillo|Hector]] (President from 1952 until 1960), and [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]] (took office as president in 1960; was president at the time of Trujillo's death). In this way, for the 31 years of his rule, he was able to maintain all governing power in the nation while appearing to be honorable and only hold power for 18 years.\n\nAll adult citizens of the Dominican Republic were required to be members of the party. They needed to carry \"[the] three strikes\" ({{lang-es|\"los tres golpes\"}})\n\n*Personal Identity Card\n*Compulsory Military Service Card\n*Dominican Party Membership Card, popularly known as \"La Palmita\"\n\nThe party had no real ideology other than support for Trujillo.  It lingered for a brief time after Trujillo's assassination in 1961.  However, it was apparent there was no place for the party in the more open society, and it was finally wound up in January 1962.\n\nAt various times, Trujillo allowed other political parties to coexist.  However, this was done only to impress foreign observers that democratization was progressing, and to allow Trujillo to monitor opponents.<ref>{{cite book |author=Crassweller RD |title=Trujillo.

All dates from the passport stamps of Saudi Arabia are written in the [[Islamic calendar|Hijra Calendar]].]]\nA '''passport stamp''' is an inked impression in a [[passport]] typically made by rubber stamp upon entering or exiting a territory.\n\nPassport stamps may occasionally take the form of sticker stamps, such as entry stamps from [[Visa policy of Japan|Japan]]. Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps. A few countries issue only entry stamps, including [[Visa policy of Canada|Canada]], [[Visa policy of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Visa policy of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Visa policy of New Zealand|New Zealand]], the [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Visa policy of the United States|United States]]. \n\n[[Visa policy of Australia|Australia]], [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Visa policy of Israel|Israel]], [[Visa policy of Macau|Macau]] and [[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] do not stamp passports upon entry nor exit, but issue landing slips instead. [[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned.

The same is the case for foreigners, except that the scroll number is given on entry and then used on exit.\n\nThe stamps are always in black except the date, which is in red.

Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

At land borders, the rectangular stamp is accompanied by a round, blue entry stamp. A round, red exit stamp is issued at all points of exit.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pakistan====\nA circular entry stamp in black ink is applied to passports of all nationalities at the time of entry.

Exit stamps are circular and in green. Both depict the date of entry/exit and entry stamps also state the terms of entry and permitted duration of stay.\n\nBoth entry and exit stamps do not name the point of entry/exit but indicate them by the use of letters of the alphabet - \"A\" is used for entry by air, namely through [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] or Seletar Airport; \"S\" by sea though the Singapore Cruiseship Terminal or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal; \"T\" by land via the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link|Tuas Checkpoint]]; and \"W\" by land via the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|Woodlands Checkpoint]].

One solution is to dedicate separate lanes to third-country nationals and to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates used by these lanes who can stamp travel documents where required: this has been adopted by the [[Finnish Border Guard]] at the automated border gates in [[Helsinki Airport]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]] and [[United States passport|United States]] [[biometric passport]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cwtjet.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Automated_Border_Control_Gates.17161248.pdf |title=How To Use The Automated Border Control Gates |work=Finnair Info |accessdate=2012-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018132624/http://cwtjet.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Automated_Border_Control_Gates.17161248.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-18 }}</ref><ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"> http://www.raja.fi/facts/news_from_the_border_guard/1/0/expanded_use_of_automated_border_control_gates_at_the_west_terminal_54569 </ref><ref> http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Images_News/ABC_Conference_Report.pdf</ref> and in the [[Port of Helsinki]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include [[Russian passport|Russian citizens]],<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"/> as well as by the Portuguese [[Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras]] at the automated border gates in [[Lisbon Airport]] where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Angolan passport|Angolan]] and [[Brazilian passport|Brazilian]] passports and holders of [[Diplomatic passport|diplomatic/service passports]]). This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary |title = Requesting a visa}}</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]].

Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps. A few countries issue only entry stamps, including [[Visa policy of Canada|Canada]], [[Visa policy of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Visa policy of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Visa policy of New Zealand|New Zealand]], the [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Visa policy of the United States|United States]]. \n\n[[Visa policy of Australia|Australia]], [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Visa policy of Israel|Israel]], [[Visa policy of Macau|Macau]] and [[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] do not stamp passports upon entry nor exit, but issue landing slips instead. [[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit. Handwritten scroll numbers on the stamp make it easier to track a person's complete journey - a Bangladeshi leaving Bangladesh would receive a scroll number upon exit; upon entry, the scroll number would be used to access related journey information of the traveller. The same is the case for foreigners, except that the scroll number is given on entry and then used on exit.\n\nThe stamps are always in black except the date, which is in red. The stamps feature an arrow at the top left corner, pointing left to denote departure, or pointing right for arrival together with a cartoon of the mode of transport at the top right corner.\n\nEntry stamps are rectangular and exit stamps are oval, exit make it visually easier to trace movements.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Bahrain====\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''entry''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain exit stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''exit''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia bavet passport stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp at [[Bavet]] land border crossing on the Cambodia-Vietnam border.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Visa cambodia Manfred Werner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Pre-sticker visas together with older type of passport stamps at [[Siem Reap]] airport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia exit stamp.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp issued at [[Siem Reap International Airport]]]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====China====\n<gallery>\nFile:Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]] in an old [[People's Republic of China passport]].\nFile:Dongguan passport stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Dongguan]] in an old People's Republic of China passport.<br>(Noted that there were no English on stamps.)\nFile:Fuzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Fuzhou Changle International Airport]] in an old [[Thai passport]].\nFile:Guangzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] in a Thai passport.\nFile:China Visa Stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] on an [[Italian passport]].\nFile:China Immigration Stramps Beijing.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] in a [[Republic of Korea passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Hong Kong====\nThe [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] used to stamp the passports of visitors entering and leaving Hong Kong (residents using their [[Hong Kong Identity Card]] did not receive a stamp). Just prior to and after the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to the [[People's Republic of China]], arrival and departure stamps were identical at all ports of entry.\n\nFor the next 15 years or so, the ink colour of the stamp differentiated the [[administrative division]] of the point of entry:\n* Stamps issued within [[New Territories]] ([[Sha Tau Kok Control Point]], [[Man Kam To Control Point]], [[Lo Wu Control Point]], [[Lok Ma Chau Control Point]], [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point]] and [[Shenzhen Bay Control Point]] by land, [[Tuen Mun Ferry Pier|Tuen Mun Ferry Terminal Control Point]] by sea) are in red ink. \n* Stamps issued within [[Kowloon]] ([[Hung Hom Station|Hung Hom Control Point]] by trains, [[Ocean Terminal, Hong Kong|Ocean Terminal Control Point]] and [[Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal|China Ferry Terminal Control Point]] by sea) are in green ink.\n* Stamps issued within [[Hong Kong Island]] ([[Hong Kong\u2013Macau Ferry Terminal|Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal Control Point]], by either sea or air) are in purple ink.\n* Stamps issued within [[Islands District]] ([[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong International Airport Control Point]] by air) are in black ink.\n\nBeginning 19 March 2013, landing slips are issued to visitors on arrival in Hong Kong instead of passport stamps, and on departure from Hong Kong no slips or passport stamps are issued (being unable to present the landing slip on departure does not affect a traveller's ability to clear immigration).

Passports are still (as of February 2013) stamped at [[Erez Crossing]] when traveling into and out of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].

Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

Exit stamps are circular and in green.

However, third-country nationals who are holders of long-term visas or residence permits or are family members of EU/EEA/Swiss/British citizens are exempt from this restriction. Further, third-country nationals 'with an essential function or need' (such as healthcare workers, transport personnel, aid workers, military personnel, seasonal agricultural workers), passengers in transit, those travelling 'for imperative family reasons' and those 'in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons' are exempt from this restriction.<ref>COVID-19: Temporary Restriction on Non-Essential Travel to the EU ([https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2020/EN/COM-2020-115-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF COM (2020) 115, 16 March 2020])</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/mobility_en |title=Temporary non-essential travel restrictions |publisher=[[European Commission]]}}</ref> Citizens of the European micro-states (Andorra, the Holy See, Monaco and San Marino) are also exempt from this restriction.

One solution is to dedicate separate lanes to third-country nationals and to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates used by these lanes who can stamp travel documents where required: this has been adopted by the [[Finnish Border Guard]] at the automated border gates in [[Helsinki Airport]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]] and [[United States passport|United States]] [[biometric passport]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cwtjet.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Automated_Border_Control_Gates.17161248.pdf |title=How To Use The Automated Border Control Gates |work=Finnair Info |accessdate=2012-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018132624/http://cwtjet.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Automated_Border_Control_Gates.17161248.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-18 }}</ref><ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"> http://www.raja.fi/facts/news_from_the_border_guard/1/0/expanded_use_of_automated_border_control_gates_at_the_west_terminal_54569 </ref><ref> http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Images_News/ABC_Conference_Report.pdf</ref> and in the [[Port of Helsinki]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include [[Russian passport|Russian citizens]],<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"/> as well as by the Portuguese [[Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras]] at the automated border gates in [[Lisbon Airport]] where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Angolan passport|Angolan]] and [[Brazilian passport|Brazilian]] passports and holders of [[Diplomatic passport|diplomatic/service passports]]). This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] '''and''' who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above, more generous rules apply \u2014 when entering/leaving Guadeloupe/Martinique/Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member; when entering/leaving Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether the residence card was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary |title = Requesting a visa}}</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]].

Martinez''' (born February 25, 1956) is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Illinois Senate]], representing the 20th district since 2003. She is also an Assistant Majority Leader in the State Senate. She is currently the Democratic nominee in the [[2020 Cook County, Illinois elections#Clerk of the Circuit Court|2020 election]] for Clerk of the [[Circuit Court of Cook County]].\n\n== Early life ==\nMartinez is a graduate of [[Northeastern Illinois University]] and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].\n\n== Senate career ==\nSenator Martinez is the first Latina woman to be elected to the Illinois State Senate. In her first year in Springfield, Martinez ensured that community agencies like the Children's Place, an agency that works with children and families affected by HIV and AIDS, and Concordia Avondale Community Center, which provides daycare, after-school programs and a center for seniors, received state funding to continue their programming. Martinez was particularly concerned with issues surrounding women's health. She passed legislation that obligates health insurance companies to provide women with contraceptive coverage. In recognition of this legislation, Martinez received the Profile in Courage Award from [[Planned Parenthood]]. Martinez targeted Illinois drivers with out of state reckless homicide and DUI convictions with the passage of a new law. This law ensures that convictions received in other states are included in Illinois driving records and subject to state laws regarding further prosecution of these offences.

She is currently the Democratic nominee in the [[2020 Cook County, Illinois elections#Clerk of the Circuit Court|2020 election]] for Clerk of the [[Circuit Court of Cook County]].\n\n== Early life ==\nMartinez is a graduate of [[Northeastern Illinois University]] and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].\n\n== Senate career ==\nSenator Martinez is the first Latina woman to be elected to the Illinois State Senate. In her first year in Springfield, Martinez ensured that community agencies like the Children's Place, an agency that works with children and families affected by HIV and AIDS, and Concordia Avondale Community Center, which provides daycare, after-school programs and a center for seniors, received state funding to continue their programming. Martinez was particularly concerned with issues surrounding women's health. She passed legislation that obligates health insurance companies to provide women with contraceptive coverage. In recognition of this legislation, Martinez received the Profile in Courage Award from [[Planned Parenthood]]. Martinez targeted Illinois drivers with out of state reckless homicide and DUI convictions with the passage of a new law. This law ensures that convictions received in other states are included in Illinois driving records and subject to state laws regarding further prosecution of these offences. To help protect consumers from becoming victims of identity theft, Martinez helped pass a law that requires all insurance cards be issued without a Social Security number.\n\nIn 2004, Martinez was awarded the [[Hillary Clinton]] Leadership Award presented to an elected official by the Illinois Democratic Women's organization.

The [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] had captured vast swathes of territory in Central and Northern India, whilst many of the Mughal nobles had asserted their independence and founded small states. The Mughal ruler, Muhammad Shah, proved unable to stop the disintegration of the empire. The imperial court administration was corrupt and weak. However, the country was extremely rich and Delhi\u2019s prosperity and prestige was still at a high. Nader Shah, attracted by the country's wealth, sought plunder like so many other foreign invaders before him.<ref name=HTdead/>\n\nNader had asked Muhammad Shah to close the Mughal frontiers around Kabul so that the Afghan rebels he was fighting against could not seek refuge in Kabul. Even though the Emperor agreed, he practically took no action. Nader seized upon this as a pretext for war.<ref>http://warfare.atspace.eu/Persia/Nader%20Shah%20Invades%20India.htm{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Together with his [[Georgians|Georgian]] subject [[Erekle II]] (Heraclius II), who took part in the expedition as a commander leading a contingent of Georgian troops,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> the long march had begun. He defeated his Afghan enemies fleeing into the Hindu Kush and also seized major cities such as [[Ghazni]], [[Kabul]] and [[Peshawar]] before advancing onto the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and capturing [[Lahore]]. Nader advanced to the river [[Indus River|Indus]] before the end of year as the Mughals mustered their army against him.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Karnal]] on 24 February 1739, Nader led his army to victory over the Mughals. Muhammad Shah surrendered and both entered [[Delhi]] together.<ref name=\"Browne\">{{Cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=90001014&ct=33|title=AN OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF PERSIA DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES (A.D. 1722\u20131922)|page=33|work=Edward G.

The city administrator attempted to fix prices at a lower level and Afsharid troops were sent to the market at [[Paharganj]], Delhi to enforce them. However, the local merchants refused to accept the lower prices and this resulted in violence during which some Afsharid troops were assaulted and killed.\n\nWhen a rumour spread that Nadir had been assassinated by a female guard at the Red Fort, some Indians attacked and killed 3,000 Afsharid troops during the riots that broke out on the night of 21 March.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Koh-i-Noor|last=William Dalrymple, Anita Anand|first=|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2017|isbn=1408888858|location=|pages=52}}</ref> Nadir, furious at the killings, retaliated by ordering his soldiers to carry out the notorious ''qatl-e-aam'' (qatl = killing, aam = common public, in open) of Delhi.\n\nOn the morning of 22 March, the Shah rode out in full armour and took a seat at the [[Sunehri Masjid (Chandni Chowk)|Sunehri Masjid]] of Roshan-ud-dowla near the Kotwali Chabutra in the middle of [[Chandni Chowk]]. He then, to the accompaniment of the rolling of drums and the blaring of trumpets, unsheathed his great battle sword in a grand flourish to the great and loud acclaim and wild cheers of the Afsharid troops present. This was the signal to start the onslaught and carnage. Almost immediately, the fully armed Afsharid army of occupation turned their swords and guns on to the unarmed and defenceless civilians in the city. The Afsharid soldiers were given full licence to do as they pleased and promised a share of the wealth as the city was plundered.\n\nAreas of Delhi such as [[Chandni Chowk]] and [[Dariba Kalan]], Fatehpuri, Faiz Bazar, Hauz Kazi, Johri Bazar and the Lahori, Ajmeri and Kabuli gates, all of which were densely populated by both Hindus and Muslims, were soon covered with [[corpse]]s.  Muslims, like Hindus, resorted to killing their women, children and themselves rather than submit to the Afsharid soldiers.\n\nIn the words of the Tazkira:\n\n{{quote|text=\"Here and there some opposition was offered, but in most places people were butchered unresistingly.

The [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] had captured vast swathes of territory in Central and Northern India, whilst many of the Mughal nobles had asserted their independence and founded small states. The Mughal ruler, Muhammad Shah, proved unable to stop the disintegration of the empire. The imperial court administration was corrupt and weak. However, the country was extremely rich and Delhi\u2019s prosperity and prestige was still at a high. Nader Shah, attracted by the country's wealth, sought plunder like so many other foreign invaders before him.<ref name=HTdead/>\n\nNader had asked Muhammad Shah to close the Mughal frontiers around Kabul so that the Afghan rebels he was fighting against could not seek refuge in Kabul. Even though the Emperor agreed, he practically took no action. Nader seized upon this as a pretext for war.<ref>http://warfare.atspace.eu/Persia/Nader%20Shah%20Invades%20India.htm{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Together with his [[Georgians|Georgian]] subject [[Erekle II]] (Heraclius II), who took part in the expedition as a commander leading a contingent of Georgian troops,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> the long march had begun. He defeated his Afghan enemies fleeing into the Hindu Kush and also seized major cities such as [[Ghazni]], [[Kabul]] and [[Peshawar]] before advancing onto the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and capturing [[Lahore]]. Nader advanced to the river [[Indus River|Indus]] before the end of year as the Mughals mustered their army against him.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Karnal]] on 24 February 1739, Nader led his army to victory over the Mughals. Muhammad Shah surrendered and both entered [[Delhi]] together.<ref name=\"Browne\">{{Cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=90001014&ct=33|title=AN OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF PERSIA DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES (A.D. 1722\u20131922)|page=33|work=Edward G.

The city administrator attempted to fix prices at a lower level and Afsharid troops were sent to the market at [[Paharganj]], Delhi to enforce them. However, the local merchants refused to accept the lower prices and this resulted in violence during which some Afsharid troops were assaulted and killed.\n\nWhen a rumour spread that Nadir had been assassinated by a female guard at the Red Fort, some Indians attacked and killed 3,000 Afsharid troops during the riots that broke out on the night of 21 March.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Koh-i-Noor|last=William Dalrymple, Anita Anand|first=|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2017|isbn=1408888858|location=|pages=52}}</ref> Nadir, furious at the killings, retaliated by ordering his soldiers to carry out the notorious ''qatl-e-aam'' (qatl = killing, aam = common public, in open) of Delhi.\n\nOn the morning of 22 March, the Shah rode out in full armour and took a seat at the [[Sunehri Masjid (Chandni Chowk)|Sunehri Masjid]] of Roshan-ud-dowla near the Kotwali Chabutra in the middle of [[Chandni Chowk]]. He then, to the accompaniment of the rolling of drums and the blaring of trumpets, unsheathed his great battle sword in a grand flourish to the great and loud acclaim and wild cheers of the Afsharid troops present. This was the signal to start the onslaught and carnage. Almost immediately, the fully armed Afsharid army of occupation turned their swords and guns on to the unarmed and defenceless civilians in the city. The Afsharid soldiers were given full licence to do as they pleased and promised a share of the wealth as the city was plundered.\n\nAreas of Delhi such as [[Chandni Chowk]] and [[Dariba Kalan]], Fatehpuri, Faiz Bazar, Hauz Kazi, Johri Bazar and the Lahori, Ajmeri and Kabuli gates, all of which were densely populated by both Hindus and Muslims, were soon covered with [[corpse]]s.  Muslims, like Hindus, resorted to killing their women, children and themselves rather than submit to the Afsharid soldiers.\n\nIn the words of the Tazkira:\n\n{{quote|text=\"Here and there some opposition was offered, but in most places people were butchered unresistingly.

An enormous fine of 20 million rupees was levied on the people of Delhi. Muhammad Shah handed over the keys to the royal treasury, and lost the [[Takht e Taus|Peacock Throne]], to Nadir Shah, which thereafter served as a symbol of Persian imperial might. Amongst a treasure trove of other fabulous jewels, Nadir also gained the [[Koh-i-Noor]] and [[Darya-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\" and \"Sea of Light,\" respectively) [[diamond]]s; they are now part of the British and Iranian Crown Jewels, respectively.

The [[inflorescence]] is a [[raceme]] or spikelike array of several flowers; the occasional species bears solitary flowers.<ref name=jeps/> The flower is bilateral in shape, with two large petal-like [[sepal]]s on the sides, often called the \"wings\",<ref name=jeps/> and three smaller sepals behind. There are three [[petal]]s in shades of reddish purple, yellow or white, which are joined at the bases. The lower of the three is the keel petal, which is \"boat-shaped, [[Glossary of leaf morphology#cucullate|cucullate]] [hood-like], or helmet-shaped\".<ref name=china/> The keel petal may have a beak or a fringe on the tip.<ref name=jeps/> [[Stamen]]s and [[gynoecium|style]] are within the curve of the keel petal. The fruit is a capsule, sometimes winged. It contains two seeds,<ref name=china/> which are usually black, hairy and tipped with a large white [[aril]].<ref name=jeps/> No members of this genus are known to form nitrogen-fixing nodules.<ref name=\"Dilworth 2008 p.\">{{cite book | last=Dilworth | first=M.

[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic studies]] showed that the genus was not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. As traditionally circumscribed, ''Polygala'' became a \"[[wastebasket taxon]]\". Almost all species with a flower apparently similar to those of the the [[Papilionoideae]] \u2013 two petaloid lateral [[sepal]]s forming 'wings', two petals forming a 'standard', and one petal forming a 'keel', plus a bilocular fruit capsule \u2013 were placed in ''Polygala'', while species with more obviously specialized features, particularly those of the fruit, were separated into separate genera. In 2011, John Richard Abbott separated some more sharply defined genera from ''Polygala''.<ref name=Abbo11>{{Citation |mode=cs1 |last1=Abbott |first1=J.
