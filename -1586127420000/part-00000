The first reaction of many of the National Guard was to find someone to blame, and D\u0105browski was the first to be accused. Rumors circulated he accepted a million francs to give up the city.

At age fourteen, she married a local resident named Cao Shishu, and was called in the court by the name as '''Venerable Madame Cao''' (\u66f9\u5927\u5bb6). Her husband died when she was still young.

After Ban Gu was imprisoned and died in 92 because of his association with the family of [[Empress Dou (Zhang)|Empress Dowager Dou]], Ban Zhao helped finish the work by making up for the missing part of the ''Babiao'' (\u516b\u8868 Eight Tables). She added the genealogy of the mother of the emperor, providing much information which was not usually kept. Later, Ma Xu added a treatise on [[astronomy]] (\u5929\u6587\u5fd7), making ''Hanshu'' a complete work.\n\nBan Zhao also wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]''. This treatise on the education of women was dedicated to the daughters in Ban Zhao's family but was circulated immediately at court.

According to this interpretation, the book also indicates women should be well-educated so they can better serve their husbands. This interpretation cites translations of passages Ban wrote such as \"Even should the husband say he loves something, when the parents-in-law say no, this is called a case of duty leading to disagreement... Nothing is better than obedience which sacrifices personal opinion.\" {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA minor revisionist theory states that the book is a guide to teach women how to avoid scandal in youth so they can survive long enough to become a powerful [[dowager]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nModern interpretations of [[Lessons for Women]] indicate that it is a founding text of [[Confucian feminism]]<ref>{{cite journal | title=Kongzi as Feminist: Confucian Self-Cultivation in a Contemporary Context | last=Wawrytko | first=Sandra | year=2002 | publisher=Journal of Chinese Philosophy | doi=10.1111/0301-8121.00011 }}</ref>.

She was the first known female Chinese historian. She completed her brother [[Ban Gu]]'s work on the history of the [[Western Han]], the ''[[Book of Han]]''. She also wrote ''[[Lessons for Women]]'', an influential work on women's conduct. She also had great interest in astronomy and mathematics and wrote poems, commemorative writings, argumentations, commentaries, essays and several longer works,<ref>{{harvnb|Wang|2003|p=177}}</ref> not all of which survive. She became China's most famous female scholar<ref>{{harvnb|Perkins|2000|p=25}}</ref> and an instructor of [[Taoist sexual practices]] for the imperial family.<ref>Gender and Sexuality in Modern Chinese History By Susan L.

At age fourteen, she married a local resident named Cao Shishu, and was called in the court by the name as '''Venerable Madame Cao''' (\u66f9\u5927\u5bb6). Her husband died when she was still young. She never remarried, instead devoting her life to scholarship.<ref>{{harvnb|Bennet Peterson|2000|p=99}}</ref> She was the daughter of the famous historian [[Ban Biao]] and younger sister of the general [[Ban Chao]] and of historian [[Ban Gu]]. She was also the grandniece of the notable scholar and poet [[Consort Ban]].\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Ban Zhao.jpg|thumb|Image of Ban Zhao by Shangguan Zhou (\u4e0a\u5b98\u5468, b. 1665)]]\nBan Zhao contributed greatly to the completion and transmission of ''[[Book of Han|Hanshu]]'' (\u6f22\u66f8, literally the \"Book of the [Former] Han\"), the official dynastic history of the [[Western Han]]. After Ban Gu was imprisoned and died in 92 because of his association with the family of [[Empress Dou (Zhang)|Empress Dowager Dou]], Ban Zhao helped finish the work by making up for the missing part of the ''Babiao'' (\u516b\u8868 Eight Tables). She added the genealogy of the mother of the emperor, providing much information which was not usually kept. Later, Ma Xu added a treatise on [[astronomy]] (\u5929\u6587\u5fd7), making ''Hanshu'' a complete work.\n\nBan Zhao also wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]''. This treatise on the education of women was dedicated to the daughters in Ban Zhao's family but was circulated immediately at court. It was popular for centuries in China as a guide for [[Women in ancient and imperial China|women's conduct]].<ref>{{harvnb|Donawerth|2002|p=14 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the interpretation of classic Western [[Orientalism]], this is a moralistic book, which generally advises women to be compliant and respectful towards the greater purpose of [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|maintaining familial harmony]], a highly regarded concept in historical China. According to this interpretation, the book also indicates women should be well-educated so they can better serve their husbands. This interpretation cites translations of passages Ban wrote such as \"Even should the husband say he loves something, when the parents-in-law say no, this is called a case of duty leading to disagreement... Nothing is better than obedience which sacrifices personal opinion.\" {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA minor revisionist theory states that the book is a guide to teach women how to avoid scandal in youth so they can survive long enough to become a powerful [[dowager]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nModern interpretations of [[Lessons for Women]] indicate that it is a founding text of [[Confucian feminism]]<ref>{{cite journal | title=Kongzi as Feminist: Confucian Self-Cultivation in a Contemporary Context | last=Wawrytko | first=Sandra | year=2002 | publisher=Journal of Chinese Philosophy | doi=10.1111/0301-8121.00011 }}</ref>.

As the Empress became regent for the infant [[Emperor Shang of Han]], she often sought the advice of Ban Zhao. In gratitude, the Empress gave both Ban Zhao's sons appointments as officials.<ref name=\"Bennet Peterson 2000 102\"/> Ban Zhao was also a librarian at court, supervising the editorial labors of a staff of assistants and training other scholars in her work. In this capacity, she rearranged and enlarged the ''Biographies of Eminent Women'' by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]]. It is possible that she supervised the copying of manuscripts from [[bamboo slips]] and silk onto a recently invented material, paper.<ref>{{harvnb|Donawerth|2002|p=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 113, Ban Zhao's son Cao Cheng (\u66f9\u6210) was appointed an official in [[Chenliu Commandery]].

The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 (equivalent to version 22), and was released in March, 2020. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987, Corel engineers Arseng Antonio and Vicky De Guzman undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989. CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.\n\n=== Features by version ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | CorelDraw\n! colspan=2 | Version support\n! rowspan=2 |Windows<br>Compatibility\n! rowspan=2 | New Features\n|-\n!

It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the [[bitmap-image editor]] [[Corel Photo-Paint]] as well as other graphics-related programs (see below). The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020 (equivalent to version 22), and was released in March, 2020. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1987, Corel engineers Arseng Antonio and Vicky De Guzman undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989. CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.\n\n=== Features by version ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | CorelDraw\n! colspan=2 | Version support\n! rowspan=2 |Windows<br>Compatibility\n! rowspan=2 | New Features\n|-\n!
