In this article, the American terminology and spelling is used generally but in country specific sections, the local spelling variant is used.\n\nThe laws relating to the licensing of drivers vary between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, a permit is issued after the recipient has passed a [[driving test]], while in others, a person acquires their permit before beginning to drive. Different categories of permit often exist for different types of motor vehicles, particularly large trucks and passenger vehicles.

Plans to make the newly phased in Smart ID contain driver licensing information have been shelved.\n\nSimilarly, the Saudi Arabian government require all drivers to carry an ID card in addition to a driving permit and present them whenever requested. In Saudi Arabia using a permit instead is only permitted if the request is made for on-site inspection/identification purposes, especially at checkpoints.

They are also used as a ''de facto'' or government-issued identification document for the holder.\n\nMost government issuers of driving permits also provide a government-issued identification card with similar attributes to those residents within their jurisdictions who do not have or maintain a valid driving permit, making it easier for them to do things such as open a bank account and perform any other activities that require official identification. Identification cards serve as government-issued photo ID but do not enable a person to operate a motor vehicle, a fact typically noted on the ID via the phrase 'Not a driver's licence' or similar wording. This type of photo ID is referred to as a Photo Card in some jurisdictions (for example, the Ontario Photo Card). Government-issued ID cards are also issued to out-of-state residents e.g. college students enrolled in an institution of higher education outside their state of residence e.g. a [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] Texas resident enrolled at [[UCLA]] where the individual retains their Texas Driver License and holds a California state issued ID card (as mentioned above e.g. bank account and financial affairs); also applicable to those who own business assets and not domiciled in a state or city as a resident e.g. one domiciled in Los Angeles and owning either a business or real estate property in Florida). In the U.S. no individual is permitted to hold multiple valid driver licenses simultaneously.\n\nOntario now plans to follow Quebec in phasing out their \"enhanced driver's licence\" so that the only remaining issuing authorities will become British Columbia and Manitoba.

The applicant would first attend training at an accredited driving school. Then, the driving school will present the applicant to a Vehicle Inspection Officer (VIO) for a driving test. Upon passing the driving test the applicant would obtain a certificate of proficiency from the VIO. The applicant then completes a drivers license application form at the Drivers Licence Centre (DLC) or downloads the form online. Afterwards he pays a licence fee online or at the Bank and presents his application form to the Board of Internal Revenue (BIR) Officer and VIO at the DLC for endorsement. After all these procedures he goes to the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Officer at the DLC for biometric data capture. He is given a temporary drivers licence which is valid for 60 days. He picks up the original drivers licence at the BIR Office after 60 days.\n\n====South Africa====\n{{Main|Driving licence in South Africa}}\n\nThe minimum driving age in South Africa is 17, when you may drive with an adult who holds a valid driving licence, after passing your learner's theory test. At 18, a driving licence can be obtained after passing the road test. Small motorcycles may be driven from the age of 16. \nTo obtain a permit, applicants must pass a written or computer-based test to obtain a learner's licence, and then pass a road test to obtain the driving license. Categories for permits include CODE B (normal vehicles), CODE C1 (LDV), CODE EC (heavy trucks), CODE A (motorcycle).\nThe learners licence theory test will contain three sets of questions with multiple answer options; you will have to select the correct answer.

Russia's first licences were issued in 1900 by [[Saint Petersburg]] authorities, and Russia joined an international convention in 1909{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. However, due to a relatively small number of cars, the attempts to create a standardized Russian licence were rather sporadic and limited to major urban areas. No comprehensive system of driver licensing was present until 1936, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government organized and standardized traffic and driving regulations, with the statewide system regulated by [[GAI|specialized police authorities]].\n\nRussia employs a system of driver's licences very similar to the EU standard. Since 2014 there are 14 main categories that require a driving licence: '''A''', '''A1''', '''B''', '''B1''', '''C''', '''C1''', '''D''', '''D1''', '''BE''', '''CE''', '''C1E''', '''DE''', '''D1E''', '''M'''<ref>Mopeds, a variant name of European '''AM''' category</ref> and two additional categories: '''Tm''' ([[tram]]) and '''Tb''' ([[trolleybus]]).\n\nThe current licence style, introduced in 2011, is a laminated plastic card similar to the [[European driving licence]] card in dimensions and outward appearance, with the bearer's photo and name (in Latin and Cyrillic scripts), place/date of issue, allowed categories, and signature. The reverse of the card features a detailed list of allowed categories. This new style is fully compliant with the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], and therefore is acceptable in all its signatory states and countries. Older credit-card-style and booklet-style licenses are also occasionally seen although they are no longer issued and are increasingly rare as a result. The Russian driving licence is also sometimes supplemented by a special card called \"\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\" (temporary permission), which serves for registering offense points and as a temporary licence if the primary license has been seized by the authorities for serious traffic offenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gai.ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510062041/http://www.gai.ru/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2000-05-10|title=\u0413\u0410\u0418 \u0420\u0423 \u2013 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b: \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0444\u043e\u0432 \u0413\u0418\u0411\u0414\u0414 \u2013 \u0424\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u2013 \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432|accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref> This supplement has been abolished and reinstated a countless number of times as the views of the traffic police change.\n\nThe legal driving age within the Russian Federation is 18 years (16 for motorcycles ('''A1''' and '''M''' categories only, not '''A''') and 20 for buses)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weheart.moscow/driving/#sel=15:1,15:15|title=Driving in Moscow \u2013 Russian road rules|work=We heart Moscow|accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref> and to obtain a license one must be physically fit to drive (including certificates of mental fitness and no record of [[substance abuse]]).

The [[Ministry of Agriculture (Russia)|Ministry of Agriculture]] approves the form of the license and the procedure for issuing it. There are 9 categories in '''tractorist-machinist's license''': '''AI''' ([[All-terrain vehicle|quad bikes]], [[snowmobile]]s and other [[off-road vehicle]]s with steering that is similar to [[Motorcycle|motorcycle's]] steering), '''AII''' (wheeled cross-country vehicles weighing less than 3,500&nbsp;kg, including [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] snow-and-swamp vehicles such as [[TREKOL-39294]], VIKING-29031, etc.), '''AIII''' ([[haul truck]]s), '''AIV''' (off-road [[bus]]es), '''B''' (wheeled and caterpillar [[tractor]]s with engine power less than 25,7&nbsp;kW), '''C''' (wheeled [[tractor]]s with engine power from 25,7&nbsp;kW to 110,3&nbsp;kW), '''D''' (wheeled [[tractor]]s with engine power over 110,3&nbsp;kW), '''E''' (caterpillar [[tractor]]s with engine power over 25,7&nbsp;kW), '''F''' (self-propelled [[agricultural machinery]]).

If applicant doesn't have the '''driver's license''' he also has to pass theoretical exam on the program approved by the [[General Administration for Traffic Safety]] of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (knowledge of [[traffic rules]]). \nIn the case of deprivation of driving licence by court decision, both licences are lost.\n\n====Switzerland====\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Pccredit.gif|alt=|thumb|Swiss driving license]]\nEven though Switzerland is an [[EFTA]] member state, it is not a member of the [[European Economic Area]]. Switzerland is instead linked to the EU by a series of [[Switzerland\u2013European Union relations|bilateral agreements]] and has generally adopted much of the harmonized EU legislation with regard to driving licenses. Swiss licenses can be exchanged in most EEA countries. Switzerland has, since the 2000s, used the EU system of vehicle categories and issued EEA-style credit-card licenses.\n\nTo apply for a car driving license (category B), the applicant must be 18 years old. They must first attend first aid courses, and pass an eyesight test. Passing a theory exam is required to receive a learner's permit valid for two years. This allows holders to drive a car only if accompanied by an adult aged 23 or more who has had a full driving license for a minimum of three years. Before passing the practical exam, the candidate must attend 10 hours of theory lessons on \"sensibilization (familiarization) to road traffic\". Practical driving lessons are not legally required, but are considered a ''de facto'' prerequisite for passing the practical exam taken with a government official Driving Test Examiner. Upon succeeding the practical exam, a probationary driving license is issued for three years. To obtain the full, unlimited, driving license after these three years, the candidate must not commit a serious traffic offense, and attend two days of further driving training.\n\nFor motorcycles and heavier vehicles, the regulations are different, and some agrarian vehicles can be driven without a license. As of 2011, a 45-minute driving lesson costs around {{currency|90|CHF}}, while the various fees and theoretical instruction costs associated with getting a car driving license can amount to up to {{currency|600|CHF}}, without counting the costs for the two days of further training.\n\nThe theoretical exam must be taken in either German, French or Italian.

If not one must get a Grade M license which only allows for one to operate a vehicle with no more than three wheels, such as a tricycle. To operate a two-wheel motorized vehicle with a sustainable speed greater than {{Convert|30|mph|abbr=on}} requires an endorsement on the license, typically after successful completion of a theory (written) and practical test.\n\nOn the federal level, motor vehicles with a curb weight of GCWR of {{Convert|26001|lb|abbr=on}} or more, a vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers (driver included), or a vehicle transporting hazardous materials can only be driven by an operator carrying a Commercial Driver License (Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986).

Sometimes a small picture of a heart or the term ''Organ Donor'' is printed on the driving permit, to indicate the holder's agreement to donate their organs in case of sudden death, such as after a collision.\n\nIn the United States, this is governed by the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]]. In New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, willingness to donate organs for transplant is also listed on driving permits. In Australia, the system of notating organ donation requests on permits was replaced in July 2005 with a national registration system and the issue of special cards. In Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), code \"115\" is printed on the reverse of their driving permit to indicate that details are on the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) Organ Donor Register.\n\n==International and interstate considerations==\nMany groupings of countries have agreed to recognize driving permits issued by the authorities of any of their members. Examples include the European Union and the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC), where holders of permits issued by any member state can drive in all member states. Most countries worldwide will also recognize the permits of citizens of foreign states wishing to drive as visitors.

In other cases, it is delivered by the same government services that deliver ordinary permits. The IDP has no validity except when used in conjunction with the driver's own domestic permit. The existence of the IDP is necessitated by many countries refusing to recognize driving permits written in foreign languages without accompanying certified translations.\n\nTemporary visitors from the United States to France (less than 90 days) are permitted to drive with a valid US state driver's license. In addition to holding a US driver's license, visitors are advised (but not required) to carry an International Driving permit, or attach a French translation to their US state driver's license.\n\nChina, at present, does not recognize IDPs and requires drivers to get an additional Chinese licence before being officially allowed on all roads. Holders of foreign permits are exempt from certain requirements when obtaining a Chinese permit.\n\nA minimum driving age often exists regardless of possession of a foreign permit; an American cannot drive below the local minimum age in Europe, nor can a 17-year-old Briton drive in mainland Europe where the minimum age is 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/living-in-france#driving-licences-and-vehicles|title=Living in France|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref>\n\nMany countries have established a ''driver's license exchange arrangement'' after reviews of the foreign jurisdiction's licensing processes.

In most cases, the driver must follow the full local procedure for obtaining a permit, but some jurisdictions have mutual recognition agreements and will exchange the foreign permit for a local one without the need to undertake an additional driving test.\n\nAn exception is the EU, where permits do not need to be exchanged since the introduction of the \"common EU driving licence scheme\".\n\n====Australia====\nEach state in Australia has different rules for how long a visitor can drive on an international license or a license from a different state.

In most international agreements the wording '''driving permit''' is used, for instance in the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]]. In this article, the American terminology and spelling is used generally but in country specific sections, the local spelling variant is used.\n\nThe laws relating to the licensing of drivers vary between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, a permit is issued after the recipient has passed a [[driving test]], while in others, a person acquires their permit before beginning to drive. Different categories of permit often exist for different types of motor vehicles, particularly large trucks and passenger vehicles. The difficulty of the driving test varies considerably between jurisdictions, as do factors such as age and the required level of competence and practice.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Karl Benz F\u00fchrerschein.jpg|thumb|The world's first permit to drive a motor vehicle, issued to [[Karl Benz]] upon his request]]\n[[Karl Benz]], inventor of the modern car, received a written \"''Genehmigung''\" (permit) from the [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Grand Ducal]] authorities to operate his car on public roads in 1888 after residents complained about the noise and smell of his ''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen|Motorwagen]]''.<ref name=\"spiegel2008\">{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/2471/der_lappen_hat_geburtstag.html|title=Der Lappen, der die Welt bedeutet|last=Lutteroth|first=Johanna |work=einestages|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=German|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> Up until the start of the 20th century, European authorities issued similar permits to drive motor vehicles ''ad hoc,'' if at all.<ref name=\"spiegel2008\"/>\n\nMandatory licensing for drivers came into force on 1 January 1904<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/motormiscellany/motoring/law-and-the-motorist/the-motor-car-act-1903|title=The Motor Car Act, 1903 - The Motor Miscellany|accessdate=2017-05-23}}</ref> after the [[Motor Car Act 1903]] received [[royal assent]] in the United Kingdom.

However, such a mark does not indicate necessarily the color on the driver's license. A driver with a young leaf mark on their car could very well be a gold driver. This is because the gold status does not disappear with a change in vehicle class.\n\n=====Blue=====\n:Drivers who have fewer than 5 years of clean driving history or who do not have a clean driving record but more than 5 years of driving history.

Drivers' information is recorded against the [[National Database and Registration Authority#Computerized National ID|Computerized National ID Card]] number which is issued at the age of 18. The Licence Issuing Authorities vary in each district and work under the relevant District Police.\n\nA new credit card format driving licence has been introduced. The licence bears the digital photo, signature and blood group information of the card holder. A record of traffic violations is stored automatically in the database. To obtain a driving licence one must register for a learner's permit at any of the local District Police's designated licence offices and then, after 42 days, one can apply for test for a regular full licence.\n\nThe test phase consists of a theory based test followed by a short practical test. Only those who pass the theory test are allowed to take the practical test. The whole test stage is a single day process where both tests are to be taken the same day. The driving licence currently issued holds basic information of the driver including name, Father's name, date of birth, address, authorized vehicle types, emergency contact, blood group, fingerprint impression, driver photo. The licence also has a magnetic strip though its viability is yet to be made public.\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Driving licence in Singapore}}\nDriving licences in Singapore are issued by the traffic police. The minimum age to obtain a provisional driving licence (PDL), which allows the holder to practice driving while under the supervision of an authorised driving instructor, is 18. A provisional driving licence is obtained once the individual has passed the basic theory test. PDL holders are then required to sit for and pass the final theory test before they are allowed to sit for the practical driving test. Once they have passed the practical driving test, they are issued with a driving licence which allows for driving without supervision, though new drivers are required to display probationary plates when driving for the first year after their licence is issued.\n\n==== South Korea ====\nIn South Korea, one must be holding a driving license called \"\uc6b4\uc804\uba74\ud5c8\uc99d\" or an international driving license.

They are administered by the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT). The minimum age is 18 years for all vehicle types.\n\n==== Thailand ====\n{{Main|Driving license in Thailand}}\nDriving in Thailand without a driver's license is prohibited and is punishable by fines. Moreover, in case of a road accident, a driver without a license can be considered as the guilty party. Also, an unlicensed driver who was in road accident will be refused medical insurance payment\n\nIt isn't difficult to receive a driver's license in Thailand. In fact, it is accessible to foreigners too. When the package of documents will be collected person need to appeal to the Transport Authority and sign up for the exam. Waiting time usually is near one month.\n\nThe exam includes theoretical and practical parts held on the same day. Reaction's tests are conducted before the exam. The complainant gets a temporary ID valid for one year. It may be extended for five years, but only if the complainant lives in Thailand on non-immigrant visa. An International driver's license is recognized in Thailand. With its help it is easy to get a license without doing the exams.\n\nThere are different plastic cards for motorcycles and vehicles.

Russia's first licences were issued in 1900 by [[Saint Petersburg]] authorities, and Russia joined an international convention in 1909{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. However, due to a relatively small number of cars, the attempts to create a standardized Russian licence were rather sporadic and limited to major urban areas. No comprehensive system of driver licensing was present until 1936, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government organized and standardized traffic and driving regulations, with the statewide system regulated by [[GAI|specialized police authorities]].\n\nRussia employs a system of driver's licences very similar to the EU standard. Since 2014 there are 14 main categories that require a driving licence: '''A''', '''A1''', '''B''', '''B1''', '''C''', '''C1''', '''D''', '''D1''', '''BE''', '''CE''', '''C1E''', '''DE''', '''D1E''', '''M'''<ref>Mopeds, a variant name of European '''AM''' category</ref> and two additional categories: '''Tm''' ([[tram]]) and '''Tb''' ([[trolleybus]]).\n\nThe current licence style, introduced in 2011, is a laminated plastic card similar to the [[European driving licence]] card in dimensions and outward appearance, with the bearer's photo and name (in Latin and Cyrillic scripts), place/date of issue, allowed categories, and signature. The reverse of the card features a detailed list of allowed categories. This new style is fully compliant with the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]], and therefore is acceptable in all its signatory states and countries. Older credit-card-style and booklet-style licenses are also occasionally seen although they are no longer issued and are increasingly rare as a result.

They must first attend first aid courses, and pass an eyesight test. Passing a theory exam is required to receive a learner's permit valid for two years. This allows holders to drive a car only if accompanied by an adult aged 23 or more who has had a full driving license for a minimum of three years. Before passing the practical exam, the candidate must attend 10 hours of theory lessons on \"sensibilization (familiarization) to road traffic\". Practical driving lessons are not legally required, but are considered a ''de facto'' prerequisite for passing the practical exam taken with a government official Driving Test Examiner. Upon succeeding the practical exam, a probationary driving license is issued for three years. To obtain the full, unlimited, driving license after these three years, the candidate must not commit a serious traffic offense, and attend two days of further driving training.\n\nFor motorcycles and heavier vehicles, the regulations are different, and some agrarian vehicles can be driven without a license.

Sometimes a small picture of a heart or the term ''Organ Donor'' is printed on the driving permit, to indicate the holder's agreement to donate their organs in case of sudden death, such as after a collision.\n\nIn the United States, this is governed by the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]]. In New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, willingness to donate organs for transplant is also listed on driving permits. In Australia, the system of notating organ donation requests on permits was replaced in July 2005 with a national registration system and the issue of special cards. In Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), code \"115\" is printed on the reverse of their driving permit to indicate that details are on the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) Organ Donor Register.\n\n==International and interstate considerations==\nMany groupings of countries have agreed to recognize driving permits issued by the authorities of any of their members. Examples include the European Union and the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (GCC), where holders of permits issued by any member state can drive in all member states. Most countries worldwide will also recognize the permits of citizens of foreign states wishing to drive as visitors. All EU member countries now issue permits in a standard format, regardless of the language of the permit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/home/drivinglicence/legislation/index_en.htm |title=Transport - Driving license |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2003-10-22 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150408/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/home/drivinglicence/legislation/index_en.htm |archive-date=2012-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Driving Permit]] (IDP) (sometimes erroneously called the ''International Driver's License'') is a booklet which is an authorized translation of a driver's home permit into up to ten languages (including languages with non-Latin scripts such as Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Japanese and Russian).<ref>{{cite web |title=International Driving Permit |url=https://www.aaa.asn.au/international-motoring/driving-overseas/ |publisher=Australian Automobile Association |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref> In many cases, it is obtained from a motoring organization such as the [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] or the equivalent in the driver's home country. In other cases, it is delivered by the same government services that deliver ordinary permits. The IDP has no validity except when used in conjunction with the driver's own domestic permit. The existence of the IDP is necessitated by many countries refusing to recognize driving permits written in foreign languages without accompanying certified translations.\n\nTemporary visitors from the United States to France (less than 90 days) are permitted to drive with a valid US state driver's license. In addition to holding a US driver's license, visitors are advised (but not required) to carry an International Driving permit, or attach a French translation to their US state driver's license.\n\nChina, at present, does not recognize IDPs and requires drivers to get an additional Chinese licence before being officially allowed on all roads. Holders of foreign permits are exempt from certain requirements when obtaining a Chinese permit.\n\nA minimum driving age often exists regardless of possession of a foreign permit; an American cannot drive below the local minimum age in Europe, nor can a 17-year-old Briton drive in mainland Europe where the minimum age is 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/living-in-france#driving-licences-and-vehicles|title=Living in France|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}</ref>\n\nMany countries have established a ''driver's license exchange arrangement'' after reviews of the foreign jurisdiction's licensing processes.

In most cases, the driver must follow the full local procedure for obtaining a permit, but some jurisdictions have mutual recognition agreements and will exchange the foreign permit for a local one without the need to undertake an additional driving test.\n\nAn exception is the EU, where permits do not need to be exchanged since the introduction of the \"common EU driving licence scheme\".\n\n====Australia====\nEach state in Australia has different rules for how long a visitor can drive on an international license or a license from a different state. For example, New South Wales allows three months<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.driverknowledgetests.com/learners-permit/driving-on-a-foreign-licence-in-australia.php|title=Driving on a foreign licence in Australia &#124; Driver Knowledge Test|website=www.driverknowledgetests.com}}</ref> whereas Victoria allows six months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.living-in-melbourne.com/Driver-licence-or-Driving-in-melbourne.html|title=Driving or Drivers licence in Melbourne|website=www.living-in-melbourne.com}}</ref> Drivers that move permanently to another state must change their license to a local state license within the prescribed time.

John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}\n\nFrom the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name=\"Biskind19697\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196\u201397 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]].

Italy had come off an impressive 2\u20131 victory over [[Diego Maradona]]'s Argentina. In the first round, however, Italy drew all three matches and qualified for the second round over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] on goals scored. Italy's striker Rossi had failed to score up to that point and there was considerable debate about whether he should be on the team, compounded with the fact that he had returned from a two-year ban following his involvement in the [[Totonero 1980]] match-fixing scandal. Italy was forced to play for a win to reach the semi-final, due to a worse goal difference, as Brazil had defeated Argentina 3\u20131 before the decisive match against Italy.\n\n==Match==\n===Summary===\nThe match put Brazil's attack against Italy's defense, with the majority of the game played around the Italian area, with the Italian midfielders and defenders returning the repeated set volleys of Brazilian shooters such as [[Zico]], [[S\u00f3crates]] and [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]]. Italian centre back [[Claudio Gentile]] was assigned to mark Brazilian striker Zico, earning a yellow card and a suspension for the semi-final. [[Paolo Rossi]] opened the scoring when he headed in [[Antonio Cabrini]]'s cross with just five minutes played. S\u00f3crates equalised for Brazil seven minutes later. In the twenty-fifth minute Rossi stepped past [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama J\u00fanior|J\u00fanior]], intercepted a pass from [[Toninho Cerezo|Cerezo]] across the Brazilians' goal, and drilled the shot home. The Brazilians threw everything in search of another equalizer, while Italy defended bravely. On 68 minutes, [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]] collected a pass from J\u00fanior and as Cerezo's dummy run distracted three defenders, fired home from 20 yards out. Now Italy had gained the lead twice thanks to Rossi's goals, and Brazil had come back twice. At 2\u20132, Brazil would have been through on goal difference, but in the 74th minute, a poor clearance from an Italian corner kick went back to the Brazilian six-yard line where Rossi and [[Francesco Graziani]] were waiting.

The physical development of the game, it was thought, meant that traditional methods had to be revised. Brazilian players had to bulk up - Rubens Minelli, the most successful domestic coach of the 70s, wanted his team to be made up of six footers. And with less space on the field, the future of football lay in the counter attack, rather than elaborate attempts to pass through midfield.\" He continues by stating that \"these thoughts have carried a lot of weight in the Brazilian game. They help explain why a succession of Brazil sides have caught the eye for explosive breaks down the flanks rather than for the succession of midfield triangles that enraptured Cappa and everyone else in 1982. When former Middlesbrough left-back Branco was in charge of Brazil\u2019s youth sides, he told me that right from the start of the process the search for big, strong youngsters was a priority. Brazilian coaches, meanwhile, became fond of spouting the statistic that the chances of a goal are reduced if the move contains more than seven passes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2011/08/brazil_have_never_looked_the_s.html |title=Brazil fail to rediscover winning formula |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> He also earlier stated in 2006 that \"had Brazil won the trophy in 1982 the team would be more than a fond memory.

Italy had come off an impressive 2\u20131 victory over [[Diego Maradona]]'s Argentina. In the first round, however, Italy drew all three matches and qualified for the second round over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] on goals scored. Italy's striker Rossi had failed to score up to that point and there was considerable debate about whether he should be on the team, compounded with the fact that he had returned from a two-year ban following his involvement in the [[Totonero 1980]] match-fixing scandal. Italy was forced to play for a win to reach the semi-final, due to a worse goal difference, as Brazil had defeated Argentina 3\u20131 before the decisive match against Italy.\n\n==Match==\n===Summary===\nThe match put Brazil's attack against Italy's defense, with the majority of the game played around the Italian area, with the Italian midfielders and defenders returning the repeated set volleys of Brazilian shooters such as [[Zico]], [[S\u00f3crates]] and [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]]. Italian centre back [[Claudio Gentile]] was assigned to mark Brazilian striker Zico, earning a yellow card and a suspension for the semi-final. [[Paolo Rossi]] opened the scoring when he headed in [[Antonio Cabrini]]'s cross with just five minutes played. S\u00f3crates equalised for Brazil seven minutes later. In the twenty-fifth minute Rossi stepped past [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama J\u00fanior|J\u00fanior]], intercepted a pass from [[Toninho Cerezo|Cerezo]] across the Brazilians' goal, and drilled the shot home. The Brazilians threw everything in search of another equalizer, while Italy defended bravely. On 68 minutes, [[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]] collected a pass from J\u00fanior and as Cerezo's dummy run distracted three defenders, fired home from 20 yards out. Now Italy had gained the lead twice thanks to Rossi's goals, and Brazil had come back twice. At 2\u20132, Brazil would have been through on goal difference, but in the 74th minute, a poor clearance from an Italian corner kick went back to the Brazilian six-yard line where Rossi and [[Francesco Graziani]] were waiting. Both aimed at the same shot, Rossi connecting to get a [[hat trick]] and sending Italy into the lead for good. In the 86th minute [[Giancarlo Antognoni]] scored a fourth goal for Italy, but it was wrongly disallowed for offside. In the dying moments [[Dino Zoff]] made a miraculous save to deny [[Oscar (footballer, born 1954)|Oscar]] a goal, ensuring that Italy advanced to the semi-final where they would meet [[Poland national football team|Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/news/a6396/1982-why-brazil-v-italy-was-one-of-footballs-greatest-ever-matches/|title=1982: Why Brazil V Italy Was One Of Football's Greatest Ever Matches|publisher=Esquire.co.uk|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Foot|authorlink=John Foot (historian)|title=Winning at All Costs: A Scandalous History of Italian Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBufCsXpkVkC&pg=PA470&lpg=PA470&dq=italy+brazil+antognoni+goal&source=bl&ots=btSCQBVbNY&sig=qo4llpQdtc_qPbcBhfRttqx0XYY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0_OyU9WRMYjV4QTZ6oC4Ag&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=italy%20brazil%20antognoni%20goal&f=false|page=470|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Details===\n{{footballbox\n|date = 5 July 1982\n|time = 17:15 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|team1 = {{fb-rt|ITA}}\n|score = 3\u20132\n|report = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=294/match=788/report.html\n|team2 = {{fb|BRA|1968}}\n|goals1 = [[Paolo Rossi|Rossi]] {{goal|5||25||74}}\n|goals2 = [[S\u00f3crates]] {{goal|12}}<br />[[Paulo Roberto Falc\u00e3o|Falc\u00e3o]] {{goal|68}}\n|stadium = [[Estadi de Sarri\u00e0|Estadio Sarri\u00e1]], [[Barcelona]]\n|attendance = 44,000\n|referee = [[Abraham Klein (referee)|Abraham Klein]] ([[Israel Football Association|Israel]])\n}}\n\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_la = _italy1982-90\n | pattern_b  = _ita82\n | pattern_ra = _italy1982-90\n | pattern_so = _italia_cm1994\n | shorts     = FFFFFF\n | socks      = 3120CC\n | title      = Italy\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n | pattern_la = _ adidasbrasil2\n | pattern_b  = _ adidasbrasil\n | pattern_ra = _ adidasbrasil1\n | pattern_sh = _adidaswhite\n | pattern_so = _brasil 1978\n | leftarm    = FFFF00\n | body       = FFFF00\n | rightarm   = FFFF00\n | shorts     = 0047AB\n | socks      = FFFFFF\n | title      = Brazil\n}}\n|}\n\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||'''1''' ||[[Dino Zoff]] ([[Captain (association football)|c]]) \n|-\n|DF ||'''4''' ||[[Antonio Cabrini]] \n|-\n|DF ||'''5''' ||[[Fulvio Collovati]] || || {{suboff|34}}\n|-\n|DF ||'''6''' ||[[Claudio Gentile]] || {{yel|13}}\n|-\n|DF ||'''7''' ||[[Gaetano Scirea]] \n|-\n|MF ||'''9''' ||[[Giancarlo Antognoni]] \n|-\n|MF ||'''13'''||[[Gabriele Oriali]] || {{yel|78}}\n|-\n|MF ||'''14'''||[[Marco Tardelli]]  || || {{suboff|75}} \n|-\n|MF ||'''16'''||[[Bruno Conti]]\n|-\n|CF ||'''19'''||[[Francesco Graziani]] \n|-\n|CF ||'''20'''||[[Paolo Rossi]] \n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitutes:'''\n|-\n|GK ||'''12'''||[[Ivano Bordon]] \n|-\n|DF ||'''3''' || [[Giuseppe Bergomi]] || || {{subon|34}}\n|-\n|MF ||'''11'''|| [[Giampiero Marini]] || || {{subon|75}}\n|-\n|MF ||'''15'''||[[Franco Causio]] \n|-\n|FW ||'''18'''||[[Alessandro Altobelli]] \n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Manager:'''\n|-\n|colspan=4|{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Enzo Bearzot]]\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%;

The physical development of the game, it was thought, meant that traditional methods had to be revised. Brazilian players had to bulk up - Rubens Minelli, the most successful domestic coach of the 70s, wanted his team to be made up of six footers. And with less space on the field, the future of football lay in the counter attack, rather than elaborate attempts to pass through midfield.\" He continues by stating that \"these thoughts have carried a lot of weight in the Brazilian game. They help explain why a succession of Brazil sides have caught the eye for explosive breaks down the flanks rather than for the succession of midfield triangles that enraptured Cappa and everyone else in 1982. When former Middlesbrough left-back Branco was in charge of Brazil\u2019s youth sides, he told me that right from the start of the process the search for big, strong youngsters was a priority.

As an intercontinental country (with lands in [[Eastern Thrace]] and [[Western Asia]]), Turkey takes part in a multitude of Western organizations including [[NATO]] as of 1952 and the [[European Economic Community]] as an [[Member State of the European Union#Related states|associate member]] as of 1959.\n\nTRT televised the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]], even during years in which Turkey was not participating in the contest.\n\n=== 1970s ===\nTurkey participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Eurovision Song Contest]] held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] did not take part in the 1975 Contest for \"unknown reasons\" according to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], but it was later revealed that the withdrawal was in protest of Turkey's debut and their [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaegreece.com/node/150|title=EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 1975|publisher=OGAE Greece|language=Greek|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Raycoff|first=Ivan|author2=Robert Deayom Tobin|title=A Song for Europe|date=July 2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 978-0-7546-5878-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+song+for+europe&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0r2r9IklIU3MfJf6wIZOWTlbgE4A#PPR18,M1|location=[[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]}}</ref> TRT organized a [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975|national final]] to select the first ever Turkish entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest. The final took place on 9 February 1975 in the studios of TRT and was hosted by [[B\u00fclend \u00d6zveren]]. The winning song, \"[[Seninle Bir Dakika]]\" (literally \"A minute with you\") by [[Semiha Yank\u0131]], was picked by averaging the ranks from the professional jury and people's jury. At the close of voting during the contest, the song received only 3 points from [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]] and placed last.\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]], Greece's entry to the contest aroused controversy due to its subject matter being the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Turkey withdrew from the contest to protest the political background of Greece's entry, called \"[[Panagia Mou, Panagia Mou]].\" Turkey televised the final on 3 April 1976 but censored the Greek entrant's performance. They played a nationalist Turkish song titled \"Memleketim\" (literally \"My motherland\", the Turkish cover of the Yiddish folk song \"Rabbi Elimelekh\"), which was one of the symbols of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in Turkey.\n\nTurkey did not take part in the contest again until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], placing 18th with the song \"[[Sevince]]\" performed by [[Nazar (band)|Nazar]] and [[Nil\u00fcfer Yumlu|Nil\u00fcfer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/paris-1978/final?sorting=rank&direction=asc|title=Final of Paris 1978 |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest |access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|The 1979 contest]] was held in [[Jerusalem]]. The Turkish entry selected was \"[[Seviyorum]]\" (literally \"I'm in love\") by [[Maria Rita Epik]]. However, Turkey withdrew from the contest due to pressure from neighboring countries to do so, which arose from ongoing controversy regarding the status of Jerusalem.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nTurkey participated in the Eurovision Song Contest consistently throughout the 1980s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]], Turkish superstar [[Ajda Pekkan]] and the song \"[[Pet'r Oil|Petrol]]\" was selected by TRT through a national final. Pekkan placed 15th with 23 points, including the first ever score 12 points received by Turkey, coming from [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]].\n\nTurkey had their best result (until 1997) in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 contest]] in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], when [[Klips ve Onlar]] placed ninth with a total of 53 points. The country scored \"nul points\" twice in the eighties, one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] (shared with [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983|Spain]]) and the other one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]. Several famous Turkish artists performed for the contest during the 1980s, including Ajda Pekkan, [[Neco (singer)|Neco]], [[Candan Er\u00e7etin]] and [[Mazhar-Fuat-\u00d6zkan|MF\u00d6]].\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe contest's popularity in Turkey suffered after [[Kayahan]], one of the most famous singers in the country, placed 17th out of 22 participating countries with 21 points. After Kayahan's poor result, Turkey's Eurovision entrants were mostly unknown or amateur singers until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]].\n\n[[\u015eebnem Paker]] represented the country in two consecutive years. The first time being in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] where she qualified for the final and placed 12th, and the second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] where she placed third, behind the UK and Ireland, with the song \"[[Dinle]]\" (\"Listen\"), sung in Turkish.\n\nAfter the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|free language rule was re-introduced in 1999]], the first Turkish entry to be partially sung in English was at the {{escyr|2000}} contest. Turkey reached the top 10 for a second time since 1986, and landed in the top three for the first time, making it the most successful result for the country until its victory in 2003. \u015eebnem Paker returned to the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998|Turkish national final]] in 1998, but placed fourth and did not qualify for the Contest as the Turkish participant for a third consecutive year. [[Tarkan T\u00fczmen|T\u00fczmen]] represented the country and placed 14th. Turkey participated all the series of the contest in the 1990s except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|the 1994 contest]], from which they were relegated due to their 21st-place finish in 1993.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, the contest became one of the most popular events in Turkey as a result of the participation of other Eastern European countries, and the victory of [[Sertab Erener]] with the song \"[[Everyway That I Can]]\". Following the introduction of [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|televoting in 1998]], (initially trialed in 1997 and first implemented in Turkey in 1999), Turkey went on to achieve eight top 10 results in the contest, having previously made the top 10 in 1986 and 1997.\n\nErener's song for [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] was the first Turkish entry in the contest to be sung completely in English. TRT selected the Turkish entry through an internal selection mainly organised by [[OGAE|OGAE Turkey]].\n\nThe 2004 contest was held  in the [[Abdi Ipekci Arena]], with the first ever semi-final held on Wednesday 12 May, followed by the final on Saturday 15 May. After Erener's victory (with the exception of the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] contest), Turkish entries to the Contest were picked internally. Turkey had always qualified to the grand final (except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|the 2011 Contest]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]) since introduction of the semi-finals in 2004 and always reached the top ten, except in 2005 and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], until the last contest they participated in (as of 2018) in 2012. From 2000, Turkey had seven songs sung in English and four sung in both English and Turkish, with just two ({{escyr|2005}} and {{escyr|2008}}) songs sung entirely in Turkish.\n\nAlong with Greece, Turkey brought the contest a new outlook with flashy stage performances and dresses alongside their oriental/Mediterranean-flavoured pop music acts (Sertab Erener, [[Sibel T\u00fcz\u00fcn]], [[Kenan Do\u011fulu]] and [[Hadise]]). In 2004, [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], the country was represented by bands, most being with rock-influenced songs with Ottoman, Eastern European and Balkan instruments. [[Athena (band)|Athena]] ranked fourth in 2004, when the contest was held in Istanbul; [[Mor ve \u00d6tesi]] ranked 7th with a song completely in Turkish in 2008 and the [[nu metal]] band [[Manga (band)|maNga]], which was named the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best European Act|Best European Act]] in the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2009]], ranked 2nd in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] respectively. Although [[Y\u00fcksek Sadakat]] in 2011 placed 13th in the first semi-final of the contest and failed to qualify, this was the first and only time that Turkey didn't qualify for the final. In 2012 Turkey participated to the Eurovision Song Contest for the last time as of 2018 with the song \"[[Love Me Back (Can Bonomo song)|Love Me Back]]\" completely sung in English by up-and-coming artist [[Can Bonomo]], which qualified for and placed seventh in the final with 112 points.\n\n==== Withdrawal and controversy ====\nTRT announced their withdrawal from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] on 14 December 2012, citing dissatisfaction with the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest|rules of the competition]]; they have yet to return.<ref name=\"wthdrw1\"/> The TRT cited the changes to the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|televote voting system]], in which a jury was introduced and the significance of televoting decreased by 50%.

As an intercontinental country (with lands in [[Eastern Thrace]] and [[Western Asia]]), Turkey takes part in a multitude of Western organizations including [[NATO]] as of 1952 and the [[European Economic Community]] as an [[Member State of the European Union#Related states|associate member]] as of 1959.\n\nTRT televised the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]], even during years in which Turkey was not participating in the contest.\n\n=== 1970s ===\nTurkey participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Eurovision Song Contest]] held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] did not take part in the 1975 Contest for \"unknown reasons\" according to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], but it was later revealed that the withdrawal was in protest of Turkey's debut and their [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaegreece.com/node/150|title=EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 1975|publisher=OGAE Greece|language=Greek|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Raycoff|first=Ivan|author2=Robert Deayom Tobin|title=A Song for Europe|date=July 2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 978-0-7546-5878-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+song+for+europe&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0r2r9IklIU3MfJf6wIZOWTlbgE4A#PPR18,M1|location=[[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]}}</ref> TRT organized a [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975|national final]] to select the first ever Turkish entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest. The final took place on 9 February 1975 in the studios of TRT and was hosted by [[B\u00fclend \u00d6zveren]]. The winning song, \"[[Seninle Bir Dakika]]\" (literally \"A minute with you\") by [[Semiha Yank\u0131]], was picked by averaging the ranks from the professional jury and people's jury. At the close of voting during the contest, the song received only 3 points from [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]] and placed last.\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]], Greece's entry to the contest aroused controversy due to its subject matter being the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Turkey withdrew from the contest to protest the political background of Greece's entry, called \"[[Panagia Mou, Panagia Mou]].\" Turkey televised the final on 3 April 1976 but censored the Greek entrant's performance. They played a nationalist Turkish song titled \"Memleketim\" (literally \"My motherland\", the Turkish cover of the Yiddish folk song \"Rabbi Elimelekh\"), which was one of the symbols of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in Turkey.\n\nTurkey did not take part in the contest again until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], placing 18th with the song \"[[Sevince]]\" performed by [[Nazar (band)|Nazar]] and [[Nil\u00fcfer Yumlu|Nil\u00fcfer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/paris-1978/final?sorting=rank&direction=asc|title=Final of Paris 1978 |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest |access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|The 1979 contest]] was held in [[Jerusalem]]. The Turkish entry selected was \"[[Seviyorum]]\" (literally \"I'm in love\") by [[Maria Rita Epik]]. However, Turkey withdrew from the contest due to pressure from neighboring countries to do so, which arose from ongoing controversy regarding the status of Jerusalem.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nTurkey participated in the Eurovision Song Contest consistently throughout the 1980s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]], Turkish superstar [[Ajda Pekkan]] and the song \"[[Pet'r Oil|Petrol]]\" was selected by TRT through a national final. Pekkan placed 15th with 23 points, including the first ever score 12 points received by Turkey, coming from [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]].\n\nTurkey had their best result (until 1997) in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 contest]] in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], when [[Klips ve Onlar]] placed ninth with a total of 53 points. The country scored \"nul points\" twice in the eighties, one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] (shared with [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983|Spain]]) and the other one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]. Several famous Turkish artists performed for the contest during the 1980s, including Ajda Pekkan, [[Neco (singer)|Neco]], [[Candan Er\u00e7etin]] and [[Mazhar-Fuat-\u00d6zkan|MF\u00d6]].\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe contest's popularity in Turkey suffered after [[Kayahan]], one of the most famous singers in the country, placed 17th out of 22 participating countries with 21 points. After Kayahan's poor result, Turkey's Eurovision entrants were mostly unknown or amateur singers until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]].\n\n[[\u015eebnem Paker]] represented the country in two consecutive years. The first time being in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] where she qualified for the final and placed 12th, and the second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] where she placed third, behind the UK and Ireland, with the song \"[[Dinle]]\" (\"Listen\"), sung in Turkish.\n\nAfter the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|free language rule was re-introduced in 1999]], the first Turkish entry to be partially sung in English was at the {{escyr|2000}} contest. Turkey reached the top 10 for a second time since 1986, and landed in the top three for the first time, making it the most successful result for the country until its victory in 2003. \u015eebnem Paker returned to the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998|Turkish national final]] in 1998, but placed fourth and did not qualify for the Contest as the Turkish participant for a third consecutive year. [[Tarkan T\u00fczmen|T\u00fczmen]] represented the country and placed 14th. Turkey participated all the series of the contest in the 1990s except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|the 1994 contest]], from which they were relegated due to their 21st-place finish in 1993.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, the contest became one of the most popular events in Turkey as a result of the participation of other Eastern European countries, and the victory of [[Sertab Erener]] with the song \"[[Everyway That I Can]]\". Following the introduction of [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|televoting in 1998]], (initially trialed in 1997 and first implemented in Turkey in 1999), Turkey went on to achieve eight top 10 results in the contest, having previously made the top 10 in 1986 and 1997.\n\nErener's song for [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] was the first Turkish entry in the contest to be sung completely in English. TRT selected the Turkish entry through an internal selection mainly organised by [[OGAE|OGAE Turkey]].\n\nThe 2004 contest was held  in the [[Abdi Ipekci Arena]], with the first ever semi-final held on Wednesday 12 May, followed by the final on Saturday 15 May. After Erener's victory (with the exception of the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] contest), Turkish entries to the Contest were picked internally. Turkey had always qualified to the grand final (except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|the 2011 Contest]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]) since introduction of the semi-finals in 2004 and always reached the top ten, except in 2005 and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], until the last contest they participated in (as of 2018) in 2012. From 2000, Turkey had seven songs sung in English and four sung in both English and Turkish, with just two ({{escyr|2005}} and {{escyr|2008}}) songs sung entirely in Turkish.\n\nAlong with Greece, Turkey brought the contest a new outlook with flashy stage performances and dresses alongside their oriental/Mediterranean-flavoured pop music acts (Sertab Erener, [[Sibel T\u00fcz\u00fcn]], [[Kenan Do\u011fulu]] and [[Hadise]]). In 2004, [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], the country was represented by bands, most being with rock-influenced songs with Ottoman, Eastern European and Balkan instruments. [[Athena (band)|Athena]] ranked fourth in 2004, when the contest was held in Istanbul; [[Mor ve \u00d6tesi]] ranked 7th with a song completely in Turkish in 2008 and the [[nu metal]] band [[Manga (band)|maNga]], which was named the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best European Act|Best European Act]] in the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2009]], ranked 2nd in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] respectively. Although [[Y\u00fcksek Sadakat]] in 2011 placed 13th in the first semi-final of the contest and failed to qualify, this was the first and only time that Turkey didn't qualify for the final. In 2012 Turkey participated to the Eurovision Song Contest for the last time as of 2018 with the song \"[[Love Me Back (Can Bonomo song)|Love Me Back]]\" completely sung in English by up-and-coming artist [[Can Bonomo]], which qualified for and placed seventh in the final with 112 points.\n\n==== Withdrawal and controversy ====\nTRT announced their withdrawal from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] on 14 December 2012, citing dissatisfaction with the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest|rules of the competition]]; they have yet to return.<ref name=\"wthdrw1\"/> The TRT cited the changes to the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|televote voting system]], in which a jury was introduced and the significance of televoting decreased by 50%.

They are a Short-Season Class A team in the [[Northwest League]], and have been an affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]] since the Volcanoes' inception in 1997. They play their home games at [[Volcanoes Stadium]], which opened in 1997 and seats 4,252 fans.\n\n==Baseball in the Salem Area==\nThe Salem-Keizer area has been home to professional baseball since 1940, when the [[Salem Senators]]  (an homage to Salem's role as Oregon's capital) were formed as a member of the Western International League (WIL). When the WIL reformed into the current Northwest League (NWL) in 1955, the Senators were a charter member of the new circuit. The Salem franchise played as the Senators until 1960, when it became a Class A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and adopted the parent club's nickname. The Salem Dodgers continued to play until the 1965 season, after which   the franchise was dormant for 17 years.\n\nIn 1977, former [[Stockton Ports]] owner/manager [[Carl W. Thompson Sr.|Carl Thompson]] purchased the Salem franchise and put it back on the field as an NWL member and Dodgers farm club. The revived Senators played until after the 1981 season, when the [[California Angels]] became the team's parent club.\n\nThe '82 Angels captured the first NWL championship by a Salem-area franchise, and became the first NWL champion with a losing regular-season record, a distinction which lasted until 2005.\n\nThe Salem Angels shifted their major-league affiliation and nickname back to the Dodgers after the 1987 season. The Dodgers played in Salem for two seasons, with future major-league star [[Mike Piazza]] on the team's 1989 roster.\n\nIn 1990, owners moved the Salem Dodgers to [[Yakima, Washington]], mainly due to lack of adequate facilities. The Salem club had played its home games at the [[Chemeketa Community College]] field, which lacked a grandstand, permanent concession stands and other amenities. It would be seven years before pro baseball returned to the Salem-Keizer metropolitan area.\n\n==Reborn as the Volcanoes==\nIn 1996, [[Bellingham Mariners|Bellingham Giants]] co-owners Jerry Walker and William Tucker announced that they were moving the NWL franchise to [[Keizer, Oregon]], a city of 22,000 located immediately north of Salem. The Bellingham club, short-season Class A affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]], had the NWL's lowest attendance figures during each of its two seasons.  The move devastated Bellingham baseball fans, many of whom still harbor hard feelings for the entire Giants organization in general and the Volcanoes in particular.\n\nKeizer had striven to assert itself as an independent, thriving city for 12 years since the former Salem suburb had become an incorporated municipality. City officials, led by Mayor Dennis Koho, and civic leaders worked toward getting a new baseball stadium located and built in Keizer. The area had lacked a suitable facility for pro baseball since the early 1960s, when the Salem Dodgers vacated historic Waters Field (which burned down in 1966).\n\nVolcanoes Stadium was built in less than a year, on a tract of land adjacent to [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] just northwest of the Keizer interchange. The 4,252-seat facility was ready for the debut of the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes in 1997. Two years later, the American Institute of Architects honored the Volcanoes with a design award for the stadium.\n\nVolcanoes Stadium also hosts all five of [[Oregon Schools Activities Association|Oregon's state high school baseball]] championship games. In 1998, the [[University of Oregon]] [[1998 Oregon Ducks football team|football team]] played its spring Green-White game in the stadium in early May.<ref name=strshn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3UxWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6usDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1908%2C1104766 |work=Eugene Register-Guard  |last=Clark |first=Bob |title=UO starters shine against the reserves |date=May 3, 1998 |page=1G}}</ref>\n\nArea fans chose the nickname \"Volcanoes\" in a contest.

They are a Short-Season Class A team in the [[Northwest League]], and have been an affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]] since the Volcanoes' inception in 1997. They play their home games at [[Volcanoes Stadium]], which opened in 1997 and seats 4,252 fans.\n\n==Baseball in the Salem Area==\nThe Salem-Keizer area has been home to professional baseball since 1940, when the [[Salem Senators]]  (an homage to Salem's role as Oregon's capital) were formed as a member of the Western International League (WIL). When the WIL reformed into the current Northwest League (NWL) in 1955, the Senators were a charter member of the new circuit. The Salem franchise played as the Senators until 1960, when it became a Class A affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and adopted the parent club's nickname. The Salem Dodgers continued to play until the 1965 season, after which   the franchise was dormant for 17 years.\n\nIn 1977, former [[Stockton Ports]] owner/manager [[Carl W. Thompson Sr.|Carl Thompson]] purchased the Salem franchise and put it back on the field as an NWL member and Dodgers farm club. The revived Senators played until after the 1981 season, when the [[California Angels]] became the team's parent club.\n\nThe '82 Angels captured the first NWL championship by a Salem-area franchise, and became the first NWL champion with a losing regular-season record, a distinction which lasted until 2005.\n\nThe Salem Angels shifted their major-league affiliation and nickname back to the Dodgers after the 1987 season. The Dodgers played in Salem for two seasons, with future major-league star [[Mike Piazza]] on the team's 1989 roster.\n\nIn 1990, owners moved the Salem Dodgers to [[Yakima, Washington]], mainly due to lack of adequate facilities. The Salem club had played its home games at the [[Chemeketa Community College]] field, which lacked a grandstand, permanent concession stands and other amenities. It would be seven years before pro baseball returned to the Salem-Keizer metropolitan area.\n\n==Reborn as the Volcanoes==\nIn 1996, [[Bellingham Mariners|Bellingham Giants]] co-owners Jerry Walker and William Tucker announced that they were moving the NWL franchise to [[Keizer, Oregon]], a city of 22,000 located immediately north of Salem. The Bellingham club, short-season Class A affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]], had the NWL's lowest attendance figures during each of its two seasons.  The move devastated Bellingham baseball fans, many of whom still harbor hard feelings for the entire Giants organization in general and the Volcanoes in particular.\n\nKeizer had striven to assert itself as an independent, thriving city for 12 years since the former Salem suburb had become an incorporated municipality. City officials, led by Mayor Dennis Koho, and civic leaders worked toward getting a new baseball stadium located and built in Keizer. The area had lacked a suitable facility for pro baseball since the early 1960s, when the Salem Dodgers vacated historic Waters Field (which burned down in 1966).\n\nVolcanoes Stadium was built in less than a year, on a tract of land adjacent to [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] just northwest of the Keizer interchange. The 4,252-seat facility was ready for the debut of the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes in 1997. Two years later, the American Institute of Architects honored the Volcanoes with a design award for the stadium.\n\nVolcanoes Stadium also hosts all five of [[Oregon Schools Activities Association|Oregon's state high school baseball]] championship games. In 1998, the [[University of Oregon]] [[1998 Oregon Ducks football team|football team]] played its spring Green-White game in the stadium in early May.<ref name=strshn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3UxWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6usDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1908%2C1104766 |work=Eugene Register-Guard  |last=Clark |first=Bob |title=UO starters shine against the reserves |date=May 3, 1998 |page=1G}}</ref>\n\nArea fans chose the nickname \"Volcanoes\" in a contest.
