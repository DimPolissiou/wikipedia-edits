It was directed by [[Bryan Singer]] from a screenplay by [[Anthony McCarten]], and produced by [[Graham King]] and Queen manager [[Jim Beach]]. It stars [[Rami Malek]] as Mercury, with [[Lucy Boynton]], [[Gwilym Lee]], [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]], [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Tom Hollander]], [[Allen Leech]], and [[Mike Myers]] in supporting roles. Queen members [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] served as consultants. A British-American venture, the film was produced by [[20th Century Fox]], [[Regency Enterprises]], [[GK Films]], and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. The film follows the singer's life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 [[Live Aid]] performance at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' was announced in 2010, with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] set to play Mercury. After he left the project in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before Malek was cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through most of [[principal photography]], which began in London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence and clashing with the cast and crew. [[Dexter Fletcher]], who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete the film, although Singer retained sole director credit as per [[Directors Guild of America]] guidelines. Fletcher received an executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 and in the United States on 2 November 2018. It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of Mercury's sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music sequences received praise.<!-- SEE TALK PAGE before changing this sourced text. --><ref name=varietyreview>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/bohemian-rhapsody-critics-reviews-roundup-rami-malek-1202990633/|title='Bohemian Rhapsody' Sees Mixed Reviews as Critics Praise Rami Malek|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Yang|first=Rachel|date=23 October 2018|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2018/11/07/rhapsody-addresses-freddie-mercurys-sexuality/38437035/|title=How 'Rhapsody' addresses Freddie Mercury's sexuality|website=[[The Detroit News]]|last=Sblendorio|first=Peter|date=7 November 2018|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies.<ref name=\"greene\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/freddie-mercury-queen-biopic-bohemian-rhapsody-movie-fact-check-746195/|title=Fact-Checking the Queen Biopic, 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=1 November 2018|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> It became a major box office success, grossing over {{US$|903&nbsp;million|long=no}} worldwide on a production budget of about {{US$|50&nbsp;million|long=no}}, becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide]] and setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Queen biopic surpasses $900m at box office |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47939549 |accessdate=15 April 2019 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' received [[List of accolades received by Bohemian Rhapsody|numerous accolades]], including a leading four wins at the [[91st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Malek), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]; it was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

After seeing the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]] perform \"[[Doing All Right]]\" at a pub, Farrokh encounters and is attracted to Mary Austin, and meets the band's drummer, [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], and guitarist, [[Brian May]], who inform him that their lead singer/bass guitarist, [[Tim Staffell]], has quit. Farrokh, who has followed the band for some time, asks to join them. He impresses Taylor and May with his vocal ability, and they let him in the band. Farrokh and Mary begin dating. With Farrokh as lead singer and [[John Deacon]] on bass, the band sells out gigs across Britain. Farrokh urges his bandmates to think bigger and they sell their tour van to book [[Trident Studios]]<ref>Depicted by the orange Trident Studios logos on tape recorders and plaques on Record Awards on wall.</ref> to record their [[Queen (Queen album)|debut album]]. An A&R rep from [[EMI Records]], watching the band experiment, asks studio engineer [[Roy Thomas Baker]] for their demos. Farrokh changes the band's name to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and legally changes his own name to [[Freddie Mercury]].\n\nThe band signs with [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], [[Elton John]]'s manager, and receives a contract with EMI. An appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' helps \"[[Killer Queen]]\" become a hit record. After touring to promote the album, Mary and Freddie become engaged. The album hits the charts in America and the band embarks on a sold-out U.S. tour, where Freddie begins to question his sexuality. In 1975, Queen records their fourth album, ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]],'' with its centerpiece, \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". Despite the effort put into writing and recording it, EMI executive Ray Foster refuses to release the song as the album's [[lead single]] due to its six-minute length. After Foster further derides the song's lyrics and operatics, Freddie retaliates by throwing a rock through Foster's window and cursing at him, to which Foster responds in kind. Freddie conspires with DJ [[Kenny Everett]] to debut the song on the radio, forcing the record company to release it as a single. Despite mixed reviews, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" becomes a smash hit. Freddie begins an affair with the band's day-to-day manager, Paul Prenter, during Queen's [[A Night at the Opera Tour|world tour]]. Confronted by Mary, Freddie comes out to her as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], but she assures him that he is gay. They end their engagement but remain friends, and she moves next door after he purchases an extravagant house in 1980.\n\nAs Freddie sinks into debauchery with the manipulative Paul, tensions arise in the band. After throwing a lavish party, Freddie gropes a waiter, Jim Hutton, who is offended. Freddie apologises and the two connect and share a kiss. Jim tells Freddie to find him when Freddie learns to like himself. Following a successful show at [[Madison Square Garden]], performing their latest hit \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", Paul suggests to Reid that Freddie is growing dissatisfied with the band, and could make better money by going solo, like [[Michael Jackson]] did. Reid proposes a solo career to Freddie, and Paul feigns ignorance, leading an enraged Freddie to fire Reid without consulting the band, furthering their strain. Freddie's (and Paul's) desire for Queen to branch out into disco and club music creates additional conflict with the band, although John Deacon writes a bass riff with a rock-disco beat that leads to their next hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\".\n\nAt a [[press conference]] promoting Queen's 1982 album ''[[Hot Space]]'', Freddie becomes hostile when he is bombarded with questions about his personal life. Freddie's relationship with his bandmates further sours after their music video for \"[[I Want to Break Free]]\", in which the band appears in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], is banned from [[MTV]] and he announces his desire to temporarily separate. He reveals his $4&nbsp;million solo deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], and the band feels betrayed. In 1984, Freddie moves to [[Munich]] to work on his first solo album, ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'', but abuses drugs and alcohol and participates in [[Orgy|orgies]] with Paul. Mary, now pregnant by her new partner and concerned about Freddie, arrives unannounced and urges him to return to the band and perform at [[Bob Geldof]]'s [[benefit concert]], [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Realizing that Paul withheld news of the concert in order to control Freddie, Freddie fires him. Paul retaliates by going public about Freddie's sexual escapades.\n\nFreddie returns to London to reconcile with his bandmates and agrees that hereafter their songs will be credited to Queen as a whole. He appeals to them to participate in Live Aid and they are given a last-minute slot. With [[HIV/AIDS]] spreading worldwide, Freddie discovers that he has contracted the virus. During a rehearsal he reveals this to the band, who are shocked and saddened, but Freddie says that pitying him is only a waste of time, and makes them promise not to say anything in order to keep the likely media frenzy from overshadowing their music. On the day of Live Aid, Freddie reconnects with Jim, introduces him to his family, and brings him to Live Aid. Mary, her husband, and Jim watch from the wings as Queen perform \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", and \"[[We Are the Champions]].\" Donations to the charity increase and the event turns into a massive success. The film ends with a series of title cards stating that Freddie died on 24 November 1991 at aged 45 from [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|AIDS-related pneumonia]]; he remained close with Jim and Mary for the rest of his life; \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released and hit number one again; and that the [[Mercury Phoenix Trust]] was founded in his honour to help those living with AIDS.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody cast on MTV Movies.jpg|thumb|(Left to right) Joe Mazzello, Rami Malek, and Gwilym Lee promoting the film in 2018.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rami Malek]] as [[Freddie Mercury]], lead vocalist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/04/rami-malek-mr-robot-freddie-mercury-queen-biopic|title=Mr Robot star Rami Malek to play Freddie Mercury in Queen biopic|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Lucy Boynton]] as Mary Austin, Mercury's girlfriend, former fianc\u00e9e, and muse<ref name=\"BoyntonCast\" />\n* [[Gwilym Lee]] as [[Brian May]], Queen's lead guitarist<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] as [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], Queen's drummer<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]] as [[John Deacon]], Queen's bass guitarist<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], Queen's manager<ref name=\"GillenHollanderCast\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aidan-gillen-tom-hollander-join-cast-bohemian-rhapsody-1043083|title=Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander Join Cast of Queen Biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|date=26 September 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Allen Leech]] as Paul Prenter, Mercury's personal manager and lover<ref name=\"LeechCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as [[Jim Beach|Jim \"Miami\" Beach]], Queen's lawyer turned manager<ref name=\"GillenHollanderCast\" />\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Ray Foster, an [[EMI]] executive<ref name=\"MyersCast\"/>\n* [[Aaron McCusker]] as Jim Hutton, Mercury's boyfriend<ref name=\"McCuskerCast\"/>\n* Meneka Das as Jer Bulsara, Mercury's mother\n* [[Ace Bhatti]] as Bomi Bulsara, Mercury's father\n* Priya Blackburn as Kashmira Bulsara, Mercury's sister\n* [[Tim Plester]] as [[Roy Thomas Baker]], Queen's sound engineer\n* [[Dermot Murphy (actor)|Dermot Murphy]] as [[Bob Geldof]], [[Live Aid]] organizer\n* Dickie Beau as [[Kenny Everett]], radio broadcaster from [[Capital London]], [[BBC Radio 1]], and [[BBC Radio 2]]\n* Jack Roth as [[Tim Staffell]], vocalist & bassist of the rock band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]\n* [[Max Bennett (actor)|Max Bennett]] as David, Mary's new boyfriend\n* Neil Fox-Roberts as Mr. Austin, Mary's father\n* [[Michelle Duncan]] as Shelley Stern, a reporter\n* [[Adam Lambert]] as Truck Stop Guy (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/adam-lambert-bohemian-rhapsody-cameo-appearance-trucker-freddie-mercury-rami-malek-1202533733/|title=Adam Lambert Confirms Disguised 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Cameo|first1=Greg|last1=Evans|first2=Greg|last2=Evans|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n* Luke Deacon (John Deacon's son) as concert attendee (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web |last1=QueenZone.com |title=Bohemian Rhapsody movie cameos (... and other weird bits) ReplyNew TopicNew PollSearch |url=http://www.queenzone.com/forums/1537030/bohemian-rhapsody-movie-cameos-and-other-weird-bits.aspx |website=Queen Zone |accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nPlans for a film about Queen were revealed in September 2010 by the band's guitarist [[Brian May]].

It was actually taken from the [[Marx Brothers]] [[A Night at the Opera (film)|film of the same name]].\n* The character of Ray Foster is fictional and loosely based on EMI chief Roy Featherstone. While Featherstone and others did think that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was too long to be released as a single, Featherstone was a fan of the band. In addition, Queen released numerous more albums and singles with EMI.<ref name=\"greene\"/>\n*[[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]] wasn't fired as Queen's manager after an argument with Mercury over his solo career as portrayed in the film.

May had released the EP ''[[Star Fleet Project]]'' in October 1983. Granted, this is never claimed in the film, though it's perceived as an implication.\n* Queen never split up, so Live Aid was not a reunion. They released the album ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'' in early 1984 and then [[The Works Tour|toured worldwide]]. The last show of the tour was eight weeks before Live Aid. They were \"extremely well-rehearsed\" for the show and did not have to get back into shape as a band. They were also not a last-minute addition to the concert.<ref name=\"greene\"/> \n* The theatrical release of the film depicts Queen performing \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" and \" [[We Are the Champions]]\" at Live Aid. In reality, the performance included \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\" and \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" before the latter song. The cast recreated the performances of these songs, but they were edited from the theatrical version of the film. \"Radio Ga Ga\" and \"Hammer to Fall\" were also shortened through editing.\n*The Rio de Janeiro concert, depicted in the movie as taking place circa 1979, was actually held during the first Rock In Rio festival, in January 1985 (thus approximately six months before the Live Aid performance);<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/galleries/bohemian-rhapsody-behind-the-scenes/|title=Bohemian Rhapsody: The Untold Stories Behind the Freddie Mercury Biopic|last=Smith|first=Greg|date=2019-07-27|website=Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> the live version for \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" used in the movie scene is taken from the 1985 Rio concert, and labeled as such in the accompanying official soundtrack for the film.\n*In a scene that didn't appear in the actual film but was briefly shown in a trailer, [[Gwilym Lee]] as Brian May and [[Joe Mazzello]] as John Deacon are seen [[Bowed guitar|playing their guitars with a bow]], which May himself claims to have never done.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvhn.nl/extra/Movie-mistakes-in-Bohemian-Rhapsody-17-facts-the-Queen-biopic-got-totally-wrong-23809088.html|title=Movie mistakes in Bohemian Rhapsody: 17 facts the Queen biopic got totally wrong|website=toestemming.ndcmediagroep.nl|url-status=live|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n*Some songs are shown out of chronological order.

Both May and Taylor have supported the view that Prenter's partnership with Mercury was a source of friction within Queen. May stated in his book ''Queen 3-D'' that \"He [Prenter] was certainly responsible for leading Freddie off on a different path, and it would be fair to say that we parted on terms that were less than good\" while Taylor revealed in the Queen documentary ''Days of our Lives'' that \"He was a very, very bad influence upon Freddie, hence on the band, really.\"<ref name=\"ultimateclassicrock.com\"/> However, Prenter's family have disputed the film's depiction of his and Mercury's relationship, stating that Prenter did not hide details of the ''Live Aid'' concert from Mercury and that he parted company with the band after ''Live Aid'' had been held.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/news/family-of-belfast-man-prenter-who-was-freddie-mercurys-pa-claim-movies-portrayal-destroys-his-name-37920667.html|title=Family of Belfast man Prenter who was Freddie Mercury's PA claim movie's portrayal destroys his name|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate= 14 July 2019|date= 15 March 2019}}</ref> In real life, Prenter was a former radio DJ who became Mercury's PA in 1977, two years after the release of ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-paul-prenter-the-bohemian-rhapsody-villain-had-a-more-complex-relationship-with-the-band-irl-13040678|title=What Happened To Paul Prenter?

It was directed by [[Bryan Singer]] from a screenplay by [[Anthony McCarten]], and produced by [[Graham King]] and Queen manager [[Jim Beach]]. It stars [[Rami Malek]] as Mercury, with [[Lucy Boynton]], [[Gwilym Lee]], [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]], [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Tom Hollander]], [[Allen Leech]], and [[Mike Myers]] in supporting roles. Queen members [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] served as consultants. A British-American venture, the film was produced by [[20th Century Fox]], [[Regency Enterprises]], [[GK Films]], and Queen Films, with Fox serving as distributor. The film follows the singer's life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 [[Live Aid]] performance at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' was announced in 2010, with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] set to play Mercury. After he left the project in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before Malek was cast in November 2016. Bryan Singer was the director through most of [[principal photography]], which began in London in September 2017, but was fired in December 2017, for absence and clashing with the cast and crew. [[Dexter Fletcher]], who was originally set to direct the film early in development, was hired to complete the film, although Singer retained sole director credit as per [[Directors Guild of America]] guidelines. Fletcher received an executive producer credit and filming concluded in January 2018.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 and in the United States on 2 November 2018. It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of Mercury's sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music sequences received praise.<!-- SEE TALK PAGE before changing this sourced text. --><ref name=varietyreview>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/bohemian-rhapsody-critics-reviews-roundup-rami-malek-1202990633/|title='Bohemian Rhapsody' Sees Mixed Reviews as Critics Praise Rami Malek|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Yang|first=Rachel|date=23 October 2018|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2018/11/07/rhapsody-addresses-freddie-mercurys-sexuality/38437035/|title=How 'Rhapsody' addresses Freddie Mercury's sexuality|website=[[The Detroit News]]|last=Sblendorio|first=Peter|date=7 November 2018|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies.<ref name=\"greene\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/freddie-mercury-queen-biopic-bohemian-rhapsody-movie-fact-check-746195/|title=Fact-Checking the Queen Biopic, 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=1 November 2018|access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> It became a major box office success, grossing over {{US$|903&nbsp;million|long=no}} worldwide on a production budget of about {{US$|50&nbsp;million|long=no}}, becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide]] and setting the all-time box office records for the biopic and drama genres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian Rhapsody: Queen biopic surpasses $900m at box office |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47939549 |accessdate=15 April 2019 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n''Bohemian Rhapsody'' received [[List of accolades received by Bohemian Rhapsody|numerous accolades]], including a leading four wins at the [[91st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Malek), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]; it was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

After seeing the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]] perform \"[[Doing All Right]]\" at a pub, Farrokh encounters and is attracted to Mary Austin, and meets the band's drummer, [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], and guitarist, [[Brian May]], who inform him that their lead singer/bass guitarist, [[Tim Staffell]], has quit. Farrokh, who has followed the band for some time, asks to join them. He impresses Taylor and May with his vocal ability, and they let him in the band. Farrokh and Mary begin dating. With Farrokh as lead singer and [[John Deacon]] on bass, the band sells out gigs across Britain. Farrokh urges his bandmates to think bigger and they sell their tour van to book [[Trident Studios]]<ref>Depicted by the orange Trident Studios logos on tape recorders and plaques on Record Awards on wall.</ref> to record their [[Queen (Queen album)|debut album]]. An A&R rep from [[EMI Records]], watching the band experiment, asks studio engineer [[Roy Thomas Baker]] for their demos. Farrokh changes the band's name to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and legally changes his own name to [[Freddie Mercury]].\n\nThe band signs with [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], [[Elton John]]'s manager, and receives a contract with EMI. An appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' helps \"[[Killer Queen]]\" become a hit record. After touring to promote the album, Mary and Freddie become engaged. The album hits the charts in America and the band embarks on a sold-out U.S. tour, where Freddie begins to question his sexuality. In 1975, Queen records their fourth album, ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]],'' with its centerpiece, \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". Despite the effort put into writing and recording it, EMI executive Ray Foster refuses to release the song as the album's [[lead single]] due to its six-minute length. After Foster further derides the song's lyrics and operatics, Freddie retaliates by throwing a rock through Foster's window and cursing at him, to which Foster responds in kind. Freddie conspires with DJ [[Kenny Everett]] to debut the song on the radio, forcing the record company to release it as a single. Despite mixed reviews, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" becomes a smash hit. Freddie begins an affair with the band's day-to-day manager, Paul Prenter, during Queen's [[A Night at the Opera Tour|world tour]]. Confronted by Mary, Freddie comes out to her as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], but she assures him that he is gay. They end their engagement but remain friends, and she moves next door after he purchases an extravagant house in 1980.\n\nAs Freddie sinks into debauchery with the manipulative Paul, tensions arise in the band. After throwing a lavish party, Freddie gropes a waiter, Jim Hutton, who is offended. Freddie apologises and the two connect and share a kiss. Jim tells Freddie to find him when Freddie learns to like himself. Following a successful show at [[Madison Square Garden]], performing their latest hit \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", Paul suggests to Reid that Freddie is growing dissatisfied with the band, and could make better money by going solo, like [[Michael Jackson]] did. Reid proposes a solo career to Freddie, and Paul feigns ignorance, leading an enraged Freddie to fire Reid without consulting the band, furthering their strain. Freddie's (and Paul's) desire for Queen to branch out into disco and club music creates additional conflict with the band, although John Deacon writes a bass riff with a rock-disco beat that leads to their next hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\".\n\nAt a [[press conference]] promoting Queen's 1982 album ''[[Hot Space]]'', Freddie becomes hostile when he is bombarded with questions about his personal life. Freddie's relationship with his bandmates further sours after their music video for \"[[I Want to Break Free]]\", in which the band appears in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], is banned from [[MTV]] and he announces his desire to temporarily separate. He reveals his $4&nbsp;million solo deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], and the band feels betrayed. In 1984, Freddie moves to [[Munich]] to work on his first solo album, ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'', but abuses drugs and alcohol and participates in [[Orgy|orgies]] with Paul. Mary, now pregnant by her new partner and concerned about Freddie, arrives unannounced and urges him to return to the band and perform at [[Bob Geldof]]'s [[benefit concert]], [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Realizing that Paul withheld news of the concert in order to control Freddie, Freddie fires him. Paul retaliates by going public about Freddie's sexual escapades.\n\nFreddie returns to London to reconcile with his bandmates and agrees that hereafter their songs will be credited to Queen as a whole. He appeals to them to participate in Live Aid and they are given a last-minute slot. With [[HIV/AIDS]] spreading worldwide, Freddie discovers that he has contracted the virus. During a rehearsal he reveals this to the band, who are shocked and saddened, but Freddie says that pitying him is only a waste of time, and makes them promise not to say anything in order to keep the likely media frenzy from overshadowing their music. On the day of Live Aid, Freddie reconnects with Jim, introduces him to his family, and brings him to Live Aid. Mary, her husband, and Jim watch from the wings as Queen perform \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", and \"[[We Are the Champions]].\" Donations to the charity increase and the event turns into a massive success. The film ends with a series of title cards stating that Freddie died on 24 November 1991 at aged 45 from [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|AIDS-related pneumonia]]; he remained close with Jim and Mary for the rest of his life; \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released and hit number one again; and that the [[Mercury Phoenix Trust]] was founded in his honour to help those living with AIDS.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody cast on MTV Movies.jpg|thumb|(Left to right) Joe Mazzello, Rami Malek, and Gwilym Lee promoting the film in 2018.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rami Malek]] as [[Freddie Mercury]], lead vocalist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/04/rami-malek-mr-robot-freddie-mercury-queen-biopic|title=Mr Robot star Rami Malek to play Freddie Mercury in Queen biopic|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Lucy Boynton]] as Mary Austin, Mercury's girlfriend, former fianc\u00e9e, and muse<ref name=\"BoyntonCast\" />\n* [[Gwilym Lee]] as [[Brian May]], Queen's lead guitarist<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] as [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], Queen's drummer<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Joseph Mazzello|Joe Mazzello]] as [[John Deacon]], Queen's bass guitarist<ref name=\"Aug2017D\" />\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], Queen's manager<ref name=\"GillenHollanderCast\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aidan-gillen-tom-hollander-join-cast-bohemian-rhapsody-1043083|title=Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander Join Cast of Queen Biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|last1=Galuppo|first1=Mia|date=26 September 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Allen Leech]] as Paul Prenter, Mercury's personal manager and lover<ref name=\"LeechCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as [[Jim Beach|Jim \"Miami\" Beach]], Queen's lawyer turned manager<ref name=\"GillenHollanderCast\" />\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Ray Foster, an [[EMI]] executive<ref name=\"MyersCast\"/>\n* [[Aaron McCusker]] as Jim Hutton, Mercury's boyfriend<ref name=\"McCuskerCast\"/>\n* Meneka Das as Jer Bulsara, Mercury's mother\n* [[Ace Bhatti]] as Bomi Bulsara, Mercury's father\n* Priya Blackburn as Kashmira Bulsara, Mercury's sister\n* [[Tim Plester]] as [[Roy Thomas Baker]], Queen's sound engineer\n* [[Dermot Murphy (actor)|Dermot Murphy]] as [[Bob Geldof]], [[Live Aid]] organizer\n* Dickie Beau as [[Kenny Everett]], radio broadcaster from [[Capital London]], [[BBC Radio 1]], and [[BBC Radio 2]]\n* Jack Roth as [[Tim Staffell]], vocalist & bassist of the rock band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]\n* [[Max Bennett (actor)|Max Bennett]] as David, Mary's new boyfriend\n* Neil Fox-Roberts as Mr. Austin, Mary's father\n* [[Michelle Duncan]] as Shelley Stern, a reporter\n* [[Adam Lambert]] as Truck Stop Guy (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/adam-lambert-bohemian-rhapsody-cameo-appearance-trucker-freddie-mercury-rami-malek-1202533733/|title=Adam Lambert Confirms Disguised 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Cameo|first1=Greg|last1=Evans|first2=Greg|last2=Evans|date=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n* Luke Deacon (John Deacon's son) as concert attendee (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web |last1=QueenZone.com |title=Bohemian Rhapsody movie cameos (... and other weird bits) ReplyNew TopicNew PollSearch |url=http://www.queenzone.com/forums/1537030/bohemian-rhapsody-movie-cameos-and-other-weird-bits.aspx |website=Queen Zone |accessdate=15 May 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nPlans for a film about Queen were revealed in September 2010 by the band's guitarist [[Brian May]].

Taking place in the 1910s during [[World War I]], players assume the role of a [[rookie]] [[aircraft pilot]] from the [[Army Air Force]] who joined the titular [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] taking control of a prebuilt [[biplane]] in order to win the [[war]] against the enemies. Its [[gameplay]] mainly consists of [[dogfight]]s against either [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled opponents or other human players using the Lynx's [[Atari Lynx#Features|ComLynx]] system, with a main four-button configuration.\n\n''Warbirds'' was written and designed by [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] veteran Robert Zdybel, who dedicated the project to his father.<ref name=\"tglocgp\"/><ref name=\"IGNw\"/> The game garnered positive reception from critics and reviewers alike who praised the presentation, [[pseudo-3D]] visuals, sound design, controls and gameplay. Its multiplayer received unanimous praise but the single-player offering was noted to be one of the title's negative points. It also served as an inspiration for [[Beyond Games]]' [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] ''[[BattleWheels]]''.<ref name=\"RG160\">{{cite magazine|last=Hawken|first=Kieren|title=From The Archives: Beyond Games|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=160|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=November 2016|pages=64\u201369}}</ref><ref name=\"IwKJFoBGDotCRA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dreamcastlive.net/blogs/post/Interview-with-Kris-Johnson-Founder-of-Beyond-Games|title=Interview with Kris Johnson, Founder of Beyond Games, Developer of the Cancelled Redline Arena|website=dreamcastlive.net|date=30 June 2018|accessdate=2019-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509005803/https://www.dreamcastlive.net/blogs/post/Interview-with-Kris-Johnson-Founder-of-Beyond-Games|archive-date=9 May 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:LYNX Warbirds.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\n''Warbirds'' is a first-person combat flight simulation game where players assume the role of a World War I [[fighter pilot]] taking control of a biplane, with the main objective being the elimination of enemies in order to win the war.<ref name=\"Wmanual\">''Warbirds'' user's manual  (Atari Lynx, US)</ref><ref name=\"AEXw\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/Atari_Explorer_Summer_1991.pdf|title=Entertainment: Lynx - Warbirds|magazine=Atari Explorer|publisher=[[Atari Corporation]]|format=PDF|date=Summer 1991|pages=58\u201359|access-date=2019-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926091610/http://www.atarimania.com/mags/pdf/Atari_Explorer_Summer_1991.pdf|archive-date=26 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A variety of options can be altered to aid in shooting down enemy planes, including turning on unlimited ammunition and changing the amount of damage the aircraft can take before it explodes and players can also choose their preferred style of play for the plane before starting.

While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

The [[Janowska concentration camp]] near [[Lwow]] (now Lviv) in occupied eastern Poland implemented a selection process. Some prisoners were assigned to work before death.

Despite the lethal effects of carbon monoxide, this was seen as unsuitable for use in the East due to the cost of transporting the carbon monoxide in cylinders.<ref name = \"warning\"/>\n\nEach extermination camp operated differently, yet each had designs for quick and efficient industrialized killing. While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Borkin|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|url=https://archive.org/details/crimepunishmento0000bork|url-access=registration|location=New York City|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\". Likewise, the ''Sonderkommando'' comforted older children who might cry \"because of the strangeness of being undressed in this fashion\".<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nYet, not every prisoner was deceived by such [[psychological warfare|psychological]] tactics; Commandant H\u00f6ss spoke of Jews \"who either guessed, or knew, what awaited them, nevertheless&nbsp;...

A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.
