It is a place of religious, cultural, historical and archaeological importance, situated in the  [[Bundelkhand]] region. It borders the [[Chitrakoot district]] in Uttar Pradesh, whose headquarters [[Chitrakoot Dham (Karwi)]] is located nearby. The town lies in the historical Chitrakoot region, which is divided between the present-day Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It is known for a number of temples and sites mentioned in [[Hindu scriptures]].\n\nIt attracts pilgrims throughout the year on occasions such as [[Amavasya]], [[Amavasya|Somwati Amavasya]], [[Deepawali]], [[Full moon|Sharad-Poornima]], [[Makar Sankranti]], [[Ramanavami]] and for Free Eye Care Medical Camps. Noted '[[Ayurvedic]]' and '[[Yoga]]' centres like 'Arogyadham' are located in Chitrakoot.\n\n==Geography==\nChitrakoot means the 'Hill of many wonders'. Chitrakoot region falls in the northern [[Vindhya range]] spread over the states of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The region is included in the District Chitrakoot of Uttar Pradesh and the District Satna of Madhya Pradesh. Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh was created on 4 September 1998.<ref name=\"chitrakoot.nic.in\">[http://chitrakoot.nic.in District Unit Chitrakoot, National Informatics Centre]</ref>\n\nChitrakoot Parvat Mala includes Kamad Giri, Hanumaan Dhara, Janki Kund, Lakshman pahari, and Devangana famous religious mountains.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nBamrauli airport at [[Allahabad]] is the nearest airport, 106.1 km. away from Chitrakoot, that connects Chitrakoot to the rest of India. Two regular flights of Air India serve this place, and once you touch down, you can always take up a taxi to Karwi, Chitrakoot.\n\n==Scriptural information==\n\nChitrakoot's spiritual legacy stretches back to legendary ages. It was in these deep forests that [[Lord Rama|Ram]], [[Goddess Sita]] and his brother [[Lakshman]] spent eleven years and six months of their fourteen years of banishment. Great sages like [[Atri]], [[Sati Anusuya]], [[Dattatreya]], Maharshi [[Markandeya]], [[Valmiki]] and many renowned seers, devotees and thinkers meditated here and the principal trinity of the [[Sanatana]] dharma, [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] visited this place according to Hindu legends.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Vinod Avasthi: ''Chitrakuta darshan (Hindi)'', Purushotam Das Agarwal, Banda</ref>\n\nIt is said that all the gods and goddesses came to Chitrakoot when Lord Rama performed the ''[[\u015ar\u0101ddha|Shraddha]]'' ceremony of his father to partake of the ''[[shuddhi]]'' (i.e. a feast given to all the relatives and friends on the thirteenth day of the death in the family). The first known mention of the place is in the [[Valmiki Ramayana|Valmiki Ramayan]], which is believed to be the first ever [[Mahakavya]] composed by the first ever poet. As Valmiki is said to be contemporaneous with (or even earlier than) Ram and is believed to have composed the [[Ramayan]] before the birth of Lord Ram, the antiquity of its fame can well be gauged.\n\nValmiki speaks of Chitrakoot as an eminently holy place inhabited by the great sages, abounding in monkeys, bears and various other kinds of fauna and flora. Both the sages [[Bharadwaj]] and Valmiki speaks of Chitrakoot in glowing terms and advise Lord Ram to make it his abode during the period of his exile. Lord Ram himself admits this bewitching impact of this place. In the ''Ramopakhyan'' and descriptions of [[teerth]]s at various places in the [[Mahabharat]], Chitrakoot finds a favoured place. In '[[Adhyatma Ramayana|Adhyatma Ramayan]]' and ''Brihat Ramayan'' testify to the throbbing spiritually and natural beauty of Chitrakuta. Various [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindi]] poets also have paid similar tributes to Chitrakuta. Mahakavi [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidas]] has described this place beautifully in his epic ''[[Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba]]''. He was so much impressed with its charms that he made Chitrakuta (which he calls Ramgiri because of its time-honored associations with lord Ram) the place of exile of his [[yaksha]] in [[Meghad\u016bta|Meghdoot]].\n\n[[Tulsidas]], the saint-poet of Hindi has spoken very reverently of Chitrakoot in all his major works-[[Ramcharit Manas]], ''Kavitawali'', ''Dohawali'' and [[Vinaya Patrika]]. The last-mentioned work contains many verses which show a deep personal bond between Tulsidas and Chitrakoot. He spent quite some part of his life here worshipping Ram and craving his darshan. It was here that he had what he must have considered the crowning moment of his achievements\u2014i.e. the darshan of his beloved deity Lord Ram at the intercession of Hanumanji. His eminent friend, the noted Hindi poet [[Rahim]] (i.e. Abdur Rahim Khankhana, the soldier-statesmen-saint-scholar-poet who was among the Nav-Ratnas of [[Akbar]]) also spent some time here, when he had fallen from favour with Akbar's son Emperor [[Jahangir]].<ref name=\"chitrakoot.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Lord Ram left Chitrakoot===\nWhen [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharat]] was asked by his ministers to take his seat upon the throne of [[Ayodhya]], he refused and came to Chitrakoot to meet Lord Ram. Here at place called Bharat Milap, Bharat met Lord Ram and requested him to return to Ayodhya and rule; but Lord Ram would not. Then Bharat returned to Ayodhya and installed the sandals on the throne, and, living in retirement, carried on the government as their minister. Now Lord Rama decided for two reasons to leave Chitrakuta: first, inasmuch as hosts of [[rakshasa]]s, out of hatred of him, annoyed the hermits of that place; and, secondly, because the host of men from Ayodhya had trampled and defiled the place; and, moreover, it reminded him too sharply of brother's grief and the citizens' and queen-mothers'. He went, therefore, with Sita and Lakshmana toward [[Dandaka]] forest.<ref>[[Sister Nivedita]] & Ananda K.Coomaraswamy: Myths and Legends of the Hindus and Bhuddhists, Kolkata, 2001 {{ISBN|81-7505-197-3}}\n</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[2011_Census_of_India|2011 Census of India]] Chitrakoot had a population of 23,316. Males constitute 54.36% of the population and females 45.63%, making Female Sex Ratio of 840 against state average of 931. Chitrakoot has an average literacy rate of 70.01%, lower than the national average of 74% and higher than state average 69.32%; with male literacy of 79.49% and female literacy of 58.40%. 15.72% of the population is under 6 years of age.<ref>https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/2312_PART_B_DCHB_SATNA.pdf</ref>\n\n==Places of tourist importance==\n[[Image:Chitrakoot (4750024971).jpg|thumb|View of Ramghat]]\n\n===Ramghat===\nThe ghats that line the Mandakini river are called Ramghat. During the exile period [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Sita]] took bath here and are believed to have appeared before the poet [[Tulsidas]].\n\n===Kamadgiri===\n[[File:Kamta nath.JPG|thumb|Shri Kamta Nath 2nd face on Kamadgiri parikrma path]]\nKamadgiri, the original Chitrakuta, is a place of religious significance. A forested hill, it is skirted all along its base by a chain of temples and is venerated today as the holy embodiment of Rama. Lord Rama is also known as Kamadnathji or Kamtanath which literally means fulfiller of all wishes.<ref>https://chitrakoot.nic.in/tourist-place/chilika-barkul-3/</ref> There is a 5&nbsp;km Parikrama Path around the Kamadgiri Mountain.\n\n===Bharat Milap===\n\n[[Image:PlacesRelatedToRama.JPG|right|thumb|200px| Places Related to [[Ramayana]], showing Chitrakuta in Rama's journey from Ayodhya to [[Lanka]]. ]]\n\nBharat Milap temple is located here, marking the spot where Bharata is said to have met Rama to persuade him to return to the throne of Ayodhya. It is said that the meeting of four brothers was so emotional that even the rocks and mountains of Chitrakut melted. Foot prints of Lord [[Rama]] and his brothers were imprinted on these rocks and are still present today and seen in Bharat Milap Mandir. Bharat milap mandir is situated beside kamadgiri mountain, in the circumambulation path of kamadgiri.\n\n===Janaki Kund===\n\nJanaki Kund is situated upstream of the Ramghat where it is believed that [[Sita]] bathed in the crystal clear waters of Mandakini river during the years of her exile with Rama.\n\n===Sati Anasuya ashrama===\n\n[[Image:Anusuya.jpg|thumb|View of Mandakini River at Anusuya ashram]]\nSati Anasuya ashrama is located further upstream, 16&nbsp;km from the town, set amidst thick forests that round to the melody of birdsong all day. It was here that Atri muni, his wife [[Anasuya]] and their three sons (who were the three incarnations of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva|Mahesh]]), lived and are said to have meditated.\n\nAs per description of [[Valmiki]] at one time there was no rain in Chitrakuta for ten years. There was a severe famine and nothing was left to eat or drink for animals and birds. Sati Anasuya performed hard and intensive austerities and got the river Mandakini down on earth. This led to the greenery and forests to grow which removed the sufferings of all sages and the animals.<ref>Ayodhya kanda&nbsp;\u2013 sarga 117 shloka 9, 10</ref>\n\nSati Anasuya ashrama at present is a very peaceful place where various streams from the hills converge and form the [[Mandakini River]]. It is said that Rama along with Sita had visited this place to meet Maharishi Atri and Sati Anasuya. It is here Sati Anasuya explained to Sita the grandeur and importance of Satitva (which means chastity; not the sati practice). The dense forests of [[Dandaka]] start from this place. It was ruled by [[Ravana]]. Ravana had appointed strong rakshasas like [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and [[Viradha]] as its rulers. The place was infected by the terror of [[rakshasa]]s.<ref>Ayodhya kanda&nbsp;\u2013 sarga 116 shloka 11, 12</ref>\n\n===Sphatic Shila===\nA few kilometres beyond Janaki Kund is another densely forested area on the banks of the Mandakini. One can climb up to the boulder, which bears the Rama's footprint and Sita's footprint. According to Ramacharit Manas it is said that Lord Rama with Lakshman was sitting on this shila (rock) when Hanuman returned from Lanka after setting it afire and confirmed the news to Lord [[Rama]] that Sita has been imprisoned in Ashoka vatika at Lanka.\n\n===Gupt-Godavari===\nGupt-Godavari is situated at a distance of 18&nbsp;km from town. Here is a pair of caves, one high and wide with an entrance through which one can barely pass, and the other long and narrow with stream of water running along its base. It is believed that Rama and Lakshmana held court in latter cave, which has two natural throne-like rocks.\n\n===Pampapur===\nIt is situated in the valley of Devangana. Sacred caves related to Lord Rama.\n\n===Hanuman Dhara===\n[[File:Temples in Hanuman Dhara.JPG|thumb|Temples in Panchmukhi Hanuman Dhara]]\nLocated on a rock-face several hundred feet up a steep hillside is a spring, said to have been created by Rama to assuage [[Hanuman]] when the latter returned after setting [[Lanka]] afire. A couple of temples commemorate this spot, which offers a panoramic view of Chitrakut.\n\n===Bharat Koop===\n\nBharath Koop is where Bharata stored holy water collected from all the places of pilgrimage in India. It is small, an isolated spot a few kilometres from the town. It has a small well and temple situated next to it. The water in the well remains pure and clean round the year. The story goes, that Bharatji  came to Chitrakoot to convince Shri Ram to come back to Ayodhya, after the death of King Dasharath, to ask Shri Ram to become king of Ayodhya and rule it, thus creating Ram-Rajya. For this purpose, he also bought the waters of five rivers along with him to do Lord Shri Ram's coronation. But, Lord Ram told Bharath that he does not wish to break his vow given to King Dasharath of coming back to Ayodhya only after completing Vanvas of 14 years. Hence, Bharath asked rishi Vashisht how to use the 5 rivers water that he brought along with him for Lord Ram's Rajya Abhishek. Rishi Vashisht advised him to put all the water along with flowers  he had got for Rajya-abhishek in a well specified near Chitrakoot. He explained that the water in this well will remain  pure and will be revered till the end of the time. Hence, upon the advice of rishi Vashisht, king Bharath followed his instructions and thus this place was named as Bharath koop.\n\n===Ram Shaiya===\n\nThis place is located on the way between Chitrakoot and Bharat Koop, in an isolated location. According to Ramayana, this is the place where Shri Ram, Sitaji and Laxmanji used to sleep and rest in the evenings after wandering around the forest of Chitrakoot. It is located between mountains with no town nearby. It has a large flat-bed rock which bears foot imprints popularly believed to be those of Shri Rama, Lakshman, and Sita Mata.\n\n==References==\n{{Wikivoyage|Chitrakoot}}\n{{reflist|30em}}6. ^ Alok Kumar: - Bhaishaundha Chitrakoot (8948057098)\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131014181338/http://www.mptourism.com/web/MapImages/Mp_map.pdf MP Tourism map]\n\n{{Hindu holy cities}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Satna district]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu holy cities]]\n[[Category:Ancient Indian cities]]\n[[Category:Cities in Bundelkhand]]\n[[Category:Places in the Ramayana]]\n[[Category:Religion in Madhya Pradesh]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the municipality in [[Madhya Pradesh]]|other uses|Chitrakoot (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n<!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Indian cities]] for details -->{{Infobox settlement\n| name                 i, Bundelkhandi\n| other_name              = Chitrakoot\n| settlement_type         = [[Town]]\n| image_skyline           = Ramghat at chitrakoot.jpg\n| image_alt               =\n| image_caption           = View of ghats at Chitrakoot\n| nickname                =\n| image_map               = \n| map_alt                 =\n| map_caption             =\n| pushpin_map             = India Madhya Pradesh\n| \npushpin_label_position  =\n| pushpin_map_alt         =\n| pushpin_map_caption     =\n| coordinates             = {{coord|25.00|N|80.83|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = India\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[district|Satna]]\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        =\n| founder                 =\n| named_for               =\n| government_type         =\n| governing_body          =\n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          =\n| area_rank               =\n| area_total_km2          =\n| elevation_footnotes     =\n| elevation_m             =\n| population_total        = 22294\n| population_as_of        = 2001\n| population_rank         =\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      =\n| population_footnotes    =\n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Hindi language|Hindi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = <!-- [[Postal Index Number|PIN]] -->\n| postal_code             =\n| registration_plate      = [[Vehicle registration plates of India|MP]]\n| website                 =\n| iso_code                = [[ISO 3166-2:IN|IN-MP]]\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Chitrakoot''' is a famous pilgrimage centre and a [[nagar panchayat]] in the [[Satna district]]  in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.

Lord Rama is also known as Kamadnathji or Kamtanath which literally means fulfiller of all wishes.<ref>https://chitrakoot.nic.in/tourist-place/chilika-barkul-3/</ref> There is a 5&nbsp;km Parikrama Path around the Kamadgiri Mountain.\n\n===Bharat Milap===\n\n[[Image:PlacesRelatedToRama.JPG|right|thumb|200px| Places Related to [[Ramayana]], showing Chitrakuta in Rama's journey from Ayodhya to [[Lanka]]. ]]\n\nBharat Milap temple is located here, marking the spot where Bharata is said to have met Rama to persuade him to return to the throne of Ayodhya. It is said that the meeting of four brothers was so emotional that even the rocks and mountains of Chitrakut melted. Foot prints of Lord [[Rama]] and his brothers were imprinted on these rocks and are still present today and seen in Bharat Milap Mandir. Bharat milap mandir is situated beside kamadgiri mountain, in the circumambulation path of kamadgiri.\n\n===Janaki Kund===\n\nJanaki Kund is situated upstream of the Ramghat where it is believed that [[Sita]] bathed in the crystal clear waters of Mandakini river during the years of her exile with Rama.\n\n===Sati Anasuya ashrama===\n\n[[Image:Anusuya.jpg|thumb|View of Mandakini River at Anusuya ashram]]\nSati Anasuya ashrama is located further upstream, 16&nbsp;km from the town, set amidst thick forests that round to the melody of birdsong all day. It was here that Atri muni, his wife [[Anasuya]] and their three sons (who were the three incarnations of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva|Mahesh]]), lived and are said to have meditated.\n\nAs per description of [[Valmiki]] at one time there was no rain in Chitrakuta for ten years. There was a severe famine and nothing was left to eat or drink for animals and birds. Sati Anasuya performed hard and intensive austerities and got the river Mandakini down on earth. This led to the greenery and forests to grow which removed the sufferings of all sages and the animals.<ref>Ayodhya kanda&nbsp;\u2013 sarga 117 shloka 9, 10</ref>\n\nSati Anasuya ashrama at present is a very peaceful place where various streams from the hills converge and form the [[Mandakini River]]. It is said that Rama along with Sita had visited this place to meet Maharishi Atri and Sati Anasuya. It is here Sati Anasuya explained to Sita the grandeur and importance of Satitva (which means chastity; not the sati practice). The dense forests of [[Dandaka]] start from this place. It was ruled by [[Ravana]]. Ravana had appointed strong rakshasas like [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] and [[Viradha]] as its rulers. The place was infected by the terror of [[rakshasa]]s.<ref>Ayodhya kanda&nbsp;\u2013 sarga 116 shloka 11, 12</ref>\n\n===Sphatic Shila===\nA few kilometres beyond Janaki Kund is another densely forested area on the banks of the Mandakini. One can climb up to the boulder, which bears the Rama's footprint and Sita's footprint. According to Ramacharit Manas it is said that Lord Rama with Lakshman was sitting on this shila (rock) when Hanuman returned from Lanka after setting it afire and confirmed the news to Lord [[Rama]] that Sita has been imprisoned in Ashoka vatika at Lanka.\n\n===Gupt-Godavari===\nGupt-Godavari is situated at a distance of 18&nbsp;km from town. Here is a pair of caves, one high and wide with an entrance through which one can barely pass, and the other long and narrow with stream of water running along its base. It is believed that Rama and Lakshmana held court in latter cave, which has two natural throne-like rocks.\n\n===Pampapur===\nIt is situated in the valley of Devangana. Sacred caves related to Lord Rama.\n\n===Hanuman Dhara===\n[[File:Temples in Hanuman Dhara.JPG|thumb|Temples in Panchmukhi Hanuman Dhara]]\nLocated on a rock-face several hundred feet up a steep hillside is a spring, said to have been created by Rama to assuage [[Hanuman]] when the latter returned after setting [[Lanka]] afire. A couple of temples commemorate this spot, which offers a panoramic view of Chitrakut.\n\n===Bharat Koop===\n\nBharath Koop is where Bharata stored holy water collected from all the places of pilgrimage in India. It is small, an isolated spot a few kilometres from the town. It has a small well and temple situated next to it. The water in the well remains pure and clean round the year. The story goes, that Bharatji  came to Chitrakoot to convince Shri Ram to come back to Ayodhya, after the death of King Dasharath, to ask Shri Ram to become king of Ayodhya and rule it, thus creating Ram-Rajya. For this purpose, he also bought the waters of five rivers along with him to do Lord Shri Ram's coronation. But, Lord Ram told Bharath that he does not wish to break his vow given to King Dasharath of coming back to Ayodhya only after completing Vanvas of 14 years. Hence, Bharath asked rishi Vashisht how to use the 5 rivers water that he brought along with him for Lord Ram's Rajya Abhishek. Rishi Vashisht advised him to put all the water along with flowers  he had got for Rajya-abhishek in a well specified near Chitrakoot. He explained that the water in this well will remain  pure and will be revered till the end of the time. Hence, upon the advice of rishi Vashisht, king Bharath followed his instructions and thus this place was named as Bharath koop.\n\n===Ram Shaiya===\n\nThis place is located on the way between Chitrakoot and Bharat Koop, in an isolated location. According to Ramayana, this is the place where Shri Ram, Sitaji and Laxmanji used to sleep and rest in the evenings after wandering around the forest of Chitrakoot. It is located between mountains with no town nearby. It has a large flat-bed rock which bears foot imprints popularly believed to be those of Shri Rama, Lakshman, and Sita Mata.\n\n==References==\n{{Wikivoyage|Chitrakoot}}\n{{reflist|30em}}6. ^ Alok Kumar: - Bhaishaundha Chitrakoot (8948057098)\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131014181338/http://www.mptourism.com/web/MapImages/Mp_map.pdf MP Tourism map]\n\n{{Hindu holy cities}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Satna district]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu holy cities]]\n[[Category:Ancient Indian cities]]\n[[Category:Cities in Bundelkhand]]\n[[Category:Places in the Ramayana]]\n[[Category:Religion in Madhya Pradesh]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eScriptural information:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitrakoot,_Madhya_Pradesh"}

After writing several non-Ethshar fantasy novels for Tor, Watt-Evans began experimentally serializing the 9th Ethshar novel, ''The Spriggan Mirror'', on his website under a modified form of the [[Street Performer Protocol]]. That novel was published in trade paperback, along with the following novel, ''The Vondish Ambassador''.

They are granted a lot of social power, prestige and wealth, and in return are expected to use their magical abilities for the common good. The system had worked well enough for hundreds of years, and the people in general considered themselves  better governed than neighbors with a more conventional aristocracy - but things are starting to change: the economy is in trouble, there is more and more discontent, in the cities people gather and listen to speeches, some of which might be seditious...This is the world into which the protagonist, a young man Anrel Murau, has grown up. His background is a bit unusual. In this society. magical ability is the key to success. While such ability is mostly hereditary, a child of commoners found to have a magical ability is taken into the aristocracy and might attain the highest positions, while a magically-deficient child of magical parents - which is unusual but does sometimes happen - is restricted to more humble positions. Anrel Murau is an example of the latter kind. His wizard parents were killed when a spell they worked went wrong. Deeply traumatized by being so orphaned, he thoroughly detests magic and is happy to be declared a non-magical person and live out his life as a simple clerk. However, when a powerful sorcerer kills Murau's best friend and engages in black magic and human sacrifice, Murau is drawn into a dangerous confrontation, and discovers himself to be an unmatched master in a new kind of magic - that of the orator stirring up the masses. Soon he is caught up in a series of escalating revolutionary events, with increasing popular discontent leading to the title's Fall of the Sorcerers - but a revolution can turn out to be very dangerous also to those who stirred it up. From the outset, it is evident that all this is in fact a fantasy analogue of [[the French Revolution]].\n\n====Other fantasy novels====\n* ''[[The Rebirth of Wonder]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Split Heirs]]'' (in collaboration with [[Esther Friesner]]) (1993)\n* ''[[Touched by the Gods]]'' (1997)\n\n===Science fiction===\n\n====The War Surplus series====\n* ''[[The Cyborg and the Sorcerers]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[The Wizard and the War Machine]]'' (1987)\n\n====[[Star Trek novels]]====\n* ''[[Star Trek Voyager|Voyager]]: [[Ragnarok (Star Trek)|Ragnarok]]'' (as Nathan Archer) (1995)\n* ''[[Star Trek Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]: [[Valhalla (Star Trek)|Valhalla]]'' (as Nathan Archer) (1995)\n\n====Carlisle Hsing====\nThe Carlisle Hsing books are [[hard-boiled detective]] mysteries set in a future interstellar civilization dominated by immensely powerful corporations, with the elites being of clearly East Asian - and specifically, Japanese - origin. Nightside City - hometown of the tough female private detective protagonist - is a city devoted to casinos and gambling, which had been shrouded in perpetual night to the inhabitants' content, but is now doomed as the slow rotation of the planet would within a few decades bring it into the Dayside, into the devastating glare and deadly radiation of the nearby sun, making human life there impossible. For inhabitants of Nightside City, \"Sunrise\" means an impending apocalypse which they must try to escape. But while the city still lives, Carlisle Hsing must earn an uncertain living in a constant fight with crooks, con-men, corrupt business executives and computer programs whose cunning is equal - sometimes superior - to that of humans. Eventually, she is drawn deeply into the private life and the convoluted plots and intrigues in the family of one of the richest and most powerful men in galaxy. With her courage and common-sense, she helps this very important client to neatly solve his problems with his wayward son - but will he allow her to live when she knows so much of his most private secrets?     \n\n* ''Nightside City'' (1989)\n* ''Realms of Light'' (2010)\n\n====Other science fiction novels====\n* ''[[The Chromosomal Code]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Shining Steel]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Denner's Wreck]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[The Spartacus File]]'' (in collaboration with [[Carl Parlagreco]]) (2005)\n* ''[[Spider-Man]]: Goblin Moon'' (as Nathan Archer, with [[Kurt Busiek]]) (1999)\n* ''[[Mars Attacks|Mars Attacks: Martian Deathtrap]]'' (as Nathan Archer) (1996)\n* ''[[Predator (novel series)|Predator]]'':\n** ''Cold War'' (as Nathan Archer) (1997)\n** ''Concrete Jungle'' (as Nathan Archer) (1995)\n\n===Horror===\n* ''[[The Nightmare People]]'' (1990)\n\n===Short stories===\nHe has written more than a hundred short stories, including \"[[Why I Left Harry's All-Night Hamburgers]]\", which won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best Short Story in 1988.\n\n====Collections====\n* ''Crosstime Traffic'' (1992)\n* ''Truth, Justice, and the American Way'' (1992) (collected in [[Mike Resnick]]'s anthology [[Alternate Presidents]])\n* ''[[Celestial Debris]]'' (2002)\n\n====Anthologies edited====\n* ''[[Newer York]]'' (1991)\n\n===Literary Criticism===\n* ''[[The Turtle Moves!

Since then, it has grown to become a significant [[political capital|political]] and [[cultural capital]] of South East Europe. In 1918 Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of an independent state, the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], and has been the capital of [[Moldova]] since 1991.\n\n==Foundation of the town==\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova 449.gif|thumb|[[M\u0103z\u0103rache Church]] on a 1996 stamp.]]\n\nFounded in 1436 as a [[monastery]] village, the city was part of the [[Moldavia]]n Principality. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was mentioned for the first time in 1436, when Moldavian princes Ilie and \u015etefan gave several villages with the common name Cheseni near the Akbash well to one [[feudal lord]] Oancea for his good service. That year, [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] signed the donation to his uncle Vlaicu, who became the owner of the village Chi\u0219in\u0103u near the well Albi\u0219oara.\n\nThe second documentary attestation (this time about the village Chi\u0219in\u0103u) dates with the chronicles from 1466. Over the next centuries Chi\u015fin\u0103u's population steadily grows and at the beginning of the 19th century it had 7,000 inhabitants.\n\n[[File:Colina Mazarachi.JPG|thumb|left|[[M\u0103z\u0103rache Church]] in the 19th century]]\n\n[[M\u0103z\u0103rache Church]] is considered to be the oldest Chi\u0219in\u0103u, erected by [[Vasile M\u0103z\u0103rache]] in 1752. It is a monument built according to the typical indigenous medieval [[Moldavian architecture]] of the 15-16th centuries; the church was built on the place on a fortress destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the 17th century. The stone block marking the location of the water spring that gave name to Chi\u0219in\u0103u is set at the foot of the hill upon which stands M\u0103z\u0103rache Church. The name of the spring - \"chisla noua\" - is believed to be the archaic [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"new spring\".\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (disambiguation)|Russo-Turkish War]]s Chi\u0219in\u0103u was twice set on fire, in 1739 and 1788.\n\nBuilt by the [[boyar]] [[Constantin R\u00e2\u015fcanu]] in 1777, [[R\u00e2\u015fcani Church]] stands top of the hill overlooking the [[B\u00e2c River]]. At the time it was built, the [[B\u00e2c River]] was navigable and formed a large reservoir in front of the church. There is a graveyard near the church in which some famous Moldavian personalities are buried.\n\nIn 1812 Chi\u0219in\u0103u came under [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] administration. Having got an official status of town in 1818, Chi\u015fin\u0103u became a centre of the Bessarabian district and since 1873 the centre of the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabian province]]. If from 1812 till 1818 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u population had increased from 7 up to 18 thousand people, by the end of the 19th century it had grown up to 110,000. The growth of population was due to the immigrants from [[Russian Empire]]. In 1856, Chi\u015fin\u0103u was the Russian Empire's fifth biggest city, after [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Moscow]], [[Odessa]], and [[Riga]].\n\nThe [[mayor of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] office was established in 1817 as City Duma and its first mayors there were the captain [[Anghel Nour]] (1817\u20131821). [[Gavril B\u0103nulescu-Bodoni]] was Metropolitan of Chi\u015fin\u0103u between 1812 and 1821. The [[\u015etefan cel Mare Central Park]] was originally laid out in 1818.\n\n==Industrial age==\nBy 1834, an [[Habsburg Monarchy|imperial]] townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous [[development plan]], which divided the city roughly into two areas: The old part of the town \u2013 with its irregular building structures \u2013 and a newer City Center and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect [[Avraam Melnikov]] established the '[[Nativity Cathedral, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Catedrala Na\u015fterea Domnului]]'. In 1840 the building of the [[Triumphal arch, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Triumphal arch]], planned by the architect [[Luca Zaushkevich]], was completed.\n\n[[File:Chi\u0219in\u0103u 1889 1.jpg|thumb|left|Chi\u015fin\u0103u, 1889.]]\n\nSince 1983 the [[National History Museum of Moldova]] has housed in a building erected in 1837. Initially the building was the headquarters of the City Duma, but in 1842 it became the Gymnasium (High School) for Boys No. 1 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.\n\n[[File:Primaria Chisinau vechi-2.jpg|thumb|[[Chi\u015fin\u0103u City Hall]]]]\n\nOn August 28, 1871 Chi\u015fin\u0103u was linked by [[Calea Ferat\u0103 din Moldova|rail]] with [[Tiraspol]] and in 1873 with [[Corne\u015fti, Moldova|Corne\u015fti]]. Chi\u015fin\u0103u-[[Ungheni]]-[[Ia\u015fi]] railway was opened on June 1, 1875 in preparation for the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]]. The town played an important part in the war between Russia and [[Ottoman Empire]], as the main [[staging area]] of the Russian invasion.\n\nOne of the most known [[mayors of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] was [[Carol Schmidt]], who led the city between 1877\u20131903. [[Alexander Bernardazzi]] was an important architect who built [[St. Teodora de la Sihla Church]] (1895) and [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u City Hall]] (1901).\n\nA statue of [[Pushkin]], who used to stroll the [[\u015etefan cel Mare Central Park]] grounds in the early 1820s, was designed by [[Alexander Opekushin]] and erected in 1885, making Chi\u015fin\u0103u the second city after [[Moscow]] to have a Pushkin monument. Originally funded by the Chi\u015fin\u0103u inhabitants, it is the oldest surviving monument in the city.\n\n==Pogrom and pre-revolution==\n[[File:Chisinau winegrowers.jpg|thumb|Chi\u015fin\u0103u winegrowers about 1900]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the [[Russian Empire]] and better economic conditions, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862 and to 125,787 by 1900. By the year 1900, 43% of the population of Chi\u015fin\u0103u was [[Jew]]ish \u2013 one of the highest numbers in Europe.\n\n[[File:Kishinev elegy.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Kishinev pogrom|Chi\u015fin\u0103u pogrom]]]]\n\nA large [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] riot took place in the town on 6\u20137 April 1903, which would later be known as the [[Kishinev pogrom]]. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47\u201349 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official [[newspaper]] of the time, ''Bessarabetz'' (''\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a''). The reactions to this incident included a petition to [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] on behalf of [[United States|the American people]] by the US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in July 1905.<ref name=\"pogrom\">[http://kishinev.moldline.net/pogrom.html Virtual Kishinev], accessed 23 December 2007</ref>\n\nOn 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred, whereby the police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the [[October Manifesto]]. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.<ref name=\"pogrom\"/>\n\n''[[Basarabia (newspaper)|Basarabia]]'' was the first [[Romanian language]] newspaper to be published in [[Bessarabia in the Russian Empire|Bessarabian guberniya]] of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1906\u20131907. In March 1907, the newspaper published the Romanian patriotic song \"[[De\u015fteapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]\" and was closed. ''[[Via\u0163a Basarabiei, 1907|Via\u0163a Basarabiei]]'' was a more moderate attempt to continue ''Basarabia'''s work, but in May 1907, it also ceased its publication. [[Lumin\u0103torul]] was founded in 1910 and [[Glasul Basarabiei]] in 1913. [[Basarabia Re\u00eennoit\u0103]] and [[F\u0103clia \u0162\u0103rii]] were closed at the request of the Russian authorities soon after the apparition.\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii Palace in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.jpg|thumb|[[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii Palace]]]]\n\n[[Cuv\u00e2nt Moldovenesc (newspaper)|Cuv\u00e2nt moldovenesc]] was founded in June 1914 by [[Nicolae Alexandri]] and with the financial support of [[Vasile Stroescu]]. Soon after the [[February Revolution]], [[Vasile Stroescu]] managed to persuade all major Bessarabian factions to leave internal fights and at four day meeting ({{OldStyleDateNY|March 28|March 15}}\u2013{{OldStyleDate|March 30|1917|March 17}}) the [[National Moldavian Party]] was created. In April 1917 the party leadership was elected. It was headed by Vasile Stroescu, having among its members [[Paul Gore (historian)|Paul Gore]] (a renowned conservative), [[Vladimir Her\u0163a]], [[Pan Halippa]] (a renowned socialist), [[Onisifor Ghibu]]. Among the leaders of the party were general [[Matei Donici]], [[Ion Pelivan]], arhimandrit [[Gurie Grosu]], [[Nicolae Alexandri]], [[Teofil Ioncu]], P. Grosu, [[Mihail Minciun\u0103]], [[Vlad Bogos]], F. Corobceanu, [[Gheorghe Buruian\u0103]], [[Simeon Murafa]], Al. Botezat, [[Alexandru Groap\u0103]], [[Ion Codreanu (parliamentary)|Ion Codreanu]], [[Vasile Gafencu]].\n\nDuring the World War I, other publications were: [[\u015ecoala Moldoveneasc\u0103]], [[Cuv\u00e2nt moldovenesc (magazine)]], [[Rom\u00e2nia Nou\u0103]], [[Ardealul]], [[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii (newspaper, 1917-1920)|Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]].\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|January 18|1918|January 5}}, Bolshevik troops occupied Chi\u015fin\u0103u, and the members of both [[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]] and the ''Council of Directors'' fled, while some of them were arrested and sentenced to death. On the same day, a secret meeting of ''Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii'' decided to send another delegation to [[Ia\u015fi]] and ask for help from Romania. The Romanian government of [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] decided to intervene, and on {{OldStyleDate|January 26|1918|January 13}}, the 9th Romanian Army under Gen. [[Bro\u015fteanu]] entered Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The Bolshevik troops retreated to [[Tighina]], and after a battle retreated further beyond the [[Dniester]].\n\nFor the first time in his history, Chi\u015fin\u0103u became the capital of an independent state on {{OldStyleDate|February 6|1918|January 24}}, when [[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]] proclaimed the independence of the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]].\n\n==Interwar period==\nBetween 1918 and 1940 the center of the city undertook large [[renovation]] work. The [[Capitoline Wolf, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Capitoline Wolf]] was opened in 1926 and in 1928 the [[Stephen the Great Monument]], by the sculptor [[Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103]], was opened.\n\nThe first society of the Romanian writers in Chi\u015fin\u0103u was formed in 1920, among the members were [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], [[\u015etefan Ciobanu (politician)|\u015etefan Ciobanu]], [[Tudor Pamfile]], [[Nicolae Dun\u0103reanu]], [[N.N.Beldiceanu]], [[Apostol D.Culea]].\n\nThe first [[aviation in Moldova|scheduled flights to Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] started on 24 June 1926, on the route [[Bucharest]] \u2013 [[Gala\u0163i]] \u2013 [[Ia\u015fi]] \u2013 Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The flights were operated by [[Compagnie Franco-Roumaine de Navigation A\u00e9rienne]] - CFRNA, later [[TAROM|LARES]].<ref>[http://www.europeanairlines.no/Arcticles_Rumania1_250306.htm Airline companies in Rumania (1918-1945)]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The airport was near Chi\u015fin\u0103u, at Bulgarica-[[Ialoveni]]. This first flight Chi\u015fin\u0103u-Bucharest was marked by the launch of a postal stamps.\n\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova md543.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Museum of Fine Arts, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Museum of Fine Arts]], 1939]]\n\nOn 1 January 1919 the Municipal Conservatoire (the Academy of Music) was created in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, in 1927 - the Faculty of Theology, in 1934 the subsidiary of the Romanian Institute of social sciences, in 1939 - municipal picture gallery. The [[Agricultural State University of Moldova]] was founded in 1933 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The [[National Museum of Fine Arts, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Museum of Fine Arts]] was founded in 1939 by the sculptor [[Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103]]. [[Gurie Grosu]] was the first [[Metropolitan of Bessarabia]].\n\n[[Via\u0163a Basarabiei]] was founded in 1932 by [[Pan Halippa]] and [[Misionarul]] in 1929. [[Radio Basarabia]] was launched on 8 October 1939, as the second radio station of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]]. ''Writer and Journalist Bessarabian Society'' took an institutionalized form in 1940. First Congress of the Society elected as president [[Pan Halippa]] as Vice President [[Nicolae Sp\u0103taru]], and as secretary general [[Nicolae Costenco]].\n\nIn the interwar period [[mayors of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] were [[Vladimir Hertza]], [[Teodor Cojocaru]], [[Iulian Levinski|I. Levinski]], [[Vasile B\u00e2rc\u0103]], [[Gherman P\u00e2ntea]], [[Nicolae Bivol]], [[Sebastian Teodorescu]], [[Ion Negrescu]], [[Constantin Ionescu]], [[Dimitrie Bogos]], [[Ion Costin]], [[Alexandru Sibirski]], [[Constantin Dardan]], [[Vladimir Cristi]], [[Anibal Dobjanski]]. Those years the quantity of the city population was not increasing, and in June 1941 Chi\u015fin\u0103u had 110,000 people.\n\n==World War II==\nIn the chaos of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Chi\u015fin\u0103u was almost completely destroyed. This began with the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] by the [[Red Army]] on 28 June 1940. As the city began to recover from the takeover, a devastating earthquake occurred on 10 November 1940. The [[epicenter]] of the quake, which measured 7.3 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]], was in eastern [[Romania]] and subsequently led to substantial destruction in the city.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B13329, Russland, Ghetto Chisinau, J\u00fcdische Frauen.jpg|thumb|left|Chi\u015fin\u0103u Ghetto]]\n\nAfter scarcely one year, the assault on the newly created [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovan SSR]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and Romanian armies began. Beginning with July 1941 the city suffered from large-scale shooting and heavy bombardments by Nazi [[Strategic bombing|air raids]]. On 16 July 1941 the [[Romanian flag]] was hoisted over the dome of the '[[Nativity Cathedral, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Catedrala Na\u015fterea Domnului]]'. The Red Army resistance in Chi\u015fin\u0103u fell on 17 July 1941. [[Michael of Romania]] and [[Ion Antonescu]] visited Chi\u015fin\u0103u on 18 August 1941.\n\nFollowing the occupation, the city suffered from the characteristic [[mass murder]] of its predominantly Jewish inhabitants. As had been seen elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the Jews were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/MemKishIntro.html \"''Memories of the Holocaust: Kishinev (Chisinau) (1941-1944)''\" from jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref>\n\nAs the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once more pulled into heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. On 24 August 1944 the Soviet warriors entered the city as a result of the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive (August 1944)|Jassy-Kishinev Operation]].\n\n==In the Soviet Union==\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully integrated into the Soviet Union. Most of Bessarabia became the Moldavian SSR with Chi\u015fin\u0103u as its capital; smaller parts of Bessarabia became parts of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. Soon after the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation of 1940]], the political and social elite was [[Soviet deportations from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|deportated by the Soviet authorities]]. Formers [[mayors of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] like [[Teodor Cojocaru]] and [[Pantelimon V. Sinadino]] died under custody in Soviet prisons. After the Soviet occupation, the [[Capitoline Wolf, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Capitoline Wolf]] and the [[Monument to Simion Murafa, Alexei Mateevici and Andrei Hodorogea]] were destroyed in 1940 by the Soviet authorities.<ref>[http://www.e-democracy.md/parties/docs/pl/200703261/ Declara\u0163ie privind restabilirea monumentului \u00een\u0103l\u0163at \u00een gr\u0103dina Catedralei \u00een memoria eroilor na\u0163ionali: Simion Murafa, Alexei Mateevici \u015fi Andrei Hodorogea]</ref><ref>[http://www.pll.md/ro/portrait/info/12/12/400/ Portrete notorii]</ref><ref>Mario-Ovidiu Oprea, [http://m.cdep.ro/pls/steno/steno.stenograma?ids=6279&idm=1&idl=2 PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES]</ref> Anti-Soviet organizations such as [[Democratic Agrarian Party]], [[Freedom Party, Bessarabia|Freedom Party]], [[Vocea Basarabiei (anti-Soviet group)|Vocea Basarabiei]] were severely reprimanded.\n\n[[File:Chisinau City Gate.jpg|thumb|[[Gates of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]]]]\n\nIn the years 1947 to 1949 the architect [[Alexey Shchusev]] developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city. If in 1944 Chi\u015fin\u0103u only had 25,000 inhabitants, by 1950 it had had 50,000. There were constructed large-scale housing and palaces in the style of [[Stalinist architecture]]. This process continued under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". In 1971 the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] in investment from the [[Budget|state budget]],.<ref>[http://www.kishinev.info/architecture_en Architecture of Chi\u015fin\u0103u] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230114/http://kishinev.info/architecture_en/ |date=2010-05-13 }} on Kishinev.info, Retrieved on 2008-10-12</ref> The new [[architectural style]] brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large [[Tower block|blocks of flats]].

A 17-story administrative building was erected in the 1980s in [[Central Chi\u015fin\u0103u]].\n\nThe [[Moldova State University]] was created in 1946, [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]] in 1949, [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u Botanical Garden]] in 1950, \u00ab[[Moldova-Film]]\u00bb in 1957, [[Luceaf\u0103rul Theatre (Chi\u0219in\u0103u)|Luceaf\u0103rul Theatre]] in 1960.

The first television from Chi\u015fin\u0103u, [[Moldova 1]], was launched on April 30, 1958, at 7:00 pm. [[Nicolae Lupan]] was the first chief redactor of [[TeleRadio-Moldova]]. [[Union of Journalists of Moldova]] was formed in 1957.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1971, a clandestine [[National Patriotic Front (Moldova)|National Patriotic Front]] was established by several young intellectuals in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, totaling over 100 members, vowing to fight for the establishment of a [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], its secession from the Soviet Union and union with Romania. In December 1971, the leaders of the National Patriotic Front, [[Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulg\u0103r]], [[Gheorghe Ghimpu]], [[Valeriu Graur]], and [[Alexandru \u015eoltoianu]] were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.<ref>[http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/basarabeni-turnati-de-securitate-la-kgb.html Unioni\u015fti basarabeni, turna\u0163i de Securitate la KGB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413022824/http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/basarabeni-turnati-de-securitate-la-kgb.html |date=2009-04-13 }}</ref>\n\n[[Literatura \u015fi Arta]] was a publication of the [[Moldovan Writers' Union]] founded in 1977; also, [[Sud-Est (magazine)]] was founded in 1977.\n\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova md394-6a.jpg|thumb|[[Triumphal arch, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Triumphal arch]]]]\n\nIn 1989\u201391, the [[Stephen the Great Monument]] was the focal point of meetings and clashes between [[Democratic Movement of Moldova|anti Soviet activists]] and pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] supporters.

Many streets of Chi\u015fin\u0103u are [[Street names in Chi\u015fin\u0103u|named after historic persons, places or events]]. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one. The first diplomatic mission in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, the [[Romanian Embassy, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Romanian Embassy]], was opened on January 20, 1992. [[BASA-press]] was the first independent news agency in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.\n\nFrom 1994, under [[Serafim Urechean]], Chi\u015fin\u0103u saw the construction and launch of new [[trolleybus]] lines, as well as an increase in capacities of existing lines, in order to improve connections between the urban districts.\n\n[[2005 Chi\u015fin\u0103u election|In 1995, elections]] for the post of [[mayor of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] were held on July 10, July 24, November 27, and December 11.\n\nOn 7 October 2002 and 8\u20139 October 2009, in Chi\u015fin\u0103u were held summits of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

The growth of population was due to the immigrants from [[Russian Empire]]. In the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the [[Russian Empire]] and better economic conditions, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862 and to 125,787 by 1900. By the year 1900, 43% of the population of Chi\u015fin\u0103u was [[Jew]]ish. In the interwar period the quantity of the city population was not increasing, and in June 1941 Chi\u015fin\u0103u had 110,000 people. The birth of the 500,000 Chi\u015fin\u0103u inhabitant was celebrated in 1979.\n\nThe population of the city is 592,900 (2007) which grows to 911,400 in the entire metropolitan area.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:3px; text-size:80%; text-align:right\"\n!align=center colspan=2| City of Chi\u015fin\u0103u <br />Population by year\n|-\n| 1812 || 7,000\n|-\n| 1818 || 18,500\n|-\n| 1828 || 21,200\n|-\n| 1835 || 34,000\n|-\n| 1844 || 52,100\n|-\n| 1851 || 58,800\n|-\n| 1861 || 93,400\n|-\n| 1865 || 94,000\n|-\n| 1870 || 102,400\n|-\n| 1897 || 108,500\n|-\n| 1900 || 125,787\n|-\n| 1902 || 131,300\n|-\n| 1912 || 121,200\n|-\n| 1913 || 116,500\n|-\n| 1919 || 113,000\n|-\n| 1923 || 113,000\n|-\n| 1930 || 114,800\n|-\n| 1939 || 112,000\n|-\n| 1941 || 110,000\n|-\n| 1950 || 134,000\n|-\n| 1959 || 216,000\n|-\n| 1960 || 226,900\n|-\n| 1963 || 253,500\n|-\n| 1970 || 356,300\n|-\n| 1972 || 400,000\n|-\n| 1979 || 500,000\n|-\n| 1980 || 519,200\n|-\n| 1984 || 614,500\n|-\n| 1989 || 661,400\n|-\n| 1991 || 676,700\n|-\n| 1992 || 667,100\n|-\n| 1993 || 663,400\n|-\n| 1996 || 661,900\n|-\n| 2004 || 664,204\n|-\n| 2007 || 592,900\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|+  '''Demographic Features (thousands) '''\n! rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"6\"|Years\n|-\n|1950\n|1960\n|1990\n|1991\n|1992\n|2004\n|-\n|new borns\n|28,5\n|20,0\n|16,4\n|15,0\n|14,2\n|\n|-\n|deaths\n|11,3\n|5,8\n|6,9\n|7,0\n|6,8\n|\n|-\n|natural increase of population\n|17,2\n|14,2\n|9,6\n|8,0\n|7,4\n|\n|-\n|marriages\n|16,8\n|12,9\n|11,8\n|10,7\n|9,6\n|\n|-\n|divorces\n|0,9\n|2,7\n|5,7\n|6,1\n|6,9\n|\n|}\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to one version, the name comes from the [[archaism|archaic]] Romanian word ''chi\u015fla'' (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and ''nou\u0103'' (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring.

Since then, it has grown to become a significant [[political capital|political]] and [[cultural capital]] of South East Europe. In 1918 Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of an independent state, the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]], and has been the capital of [[Moldova]] since 1991.\n\n==Foundation of the town==\n[[File:Stamp of Moldova 449.gif|thumb|[[M\u0103z\u0103rache Church]] on a 1996 stamp.]]\n\nFounded in 1436 as a [[monastery]] village, the city was part of the [[Moldavia]]n Principality. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was mentioned for the first time in 1436, when Moldavian princes Ilie and \u015etefan gave several villages with the common name Cheseni near the Akbash well to one [[feudal lord]] Oancea for his good service. That year, [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] signed the donation to his uncle Vlaicu, who became the owner of the village Chi\u0219in\u0103u near the well Albi\u0219oara.\n\nThe second documentary attestation (this time about the village Chi\u0219in\u0103u) dates with the chronicles from 1466. Over the next centuries Chi\u015fin\u0103u's population steadily grows and at the beginning of the 19th century it had 7,000 inhabitants.\n\n[[File:Colina Mazarachi.JPG|thumb|left|[[M\u0103z\u0103rache Church]] in the 19th century]]\n\n[[M\u0103z\u0103rache Church]] is considered to be the oldest Chi\u0219in\u0103u, erected by [[Vasile M\u0103z\u0103rache]] in 1752. It is a monument built according to the typical indigenous medieval [[Moldavian architecture]] of the 15-16th centuries; the church was built on the place on a fortress destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the 17th century. The stone block marking the location of the water spring that gave name to Chi\u0219in\u0103u is set at the foot of the hill upon which stands M\u0103z\u0103rache Church. The name of the spring - \"chisla noua\" - is believed to be the archaic [[Romanian language|Romanian]] for \"new spring\".\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (disambiguation)|Russo-Turkish War]]s Chi\u0219in\u0103u was twice set on fire, in 1739 and 1788.\n\nBuilt by the [[boyar]] [[Constantin R\u00e2\u015fcanu]] in 1777, [[R\u00e2\u015fcani Church]] stands top of the hill overlooking the [[B\u00e2c River]]. At the time it was built, the [[B\u00e2c River]] was navigable and formed a large reservoir in front of the church. There is a graveyard near the church in which some famous Moldavian personalities are buried.\n\nIn 1812 Chi\u0219in\u0103u came under [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] administration. Having got an official status of town in 1818, Chi\u015fin\u0103u became a centre of the Bessarabian district and since 1873 the centre of the [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabian province]]. If from 1812 till 1818 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u population had increased from 7 up to 18 thousand people, by the end of the 19th century it had grown up to 110,000. The growth of population was due to the immigrants from [[Russian Empire]]. In 1856, Chi\u015fin\u0103u was the Russian Empire's fifth biggest city, after [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Moscow]], [[Odessa]], and [[Riga]].\n\nThe [[mayor of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] office was established in 1817 as City Duma and its first mayors there were the captain [[Anghel Nour]] (1817\u20131821). [[Gavril B\u0103nulescu-Bodoni]] was Metropolitan of Chi\u015fin\u0103u between 1812 and 1821. The [[\u015etefan cel Mare Central Park]] was originally laid out in 1818.\n\n==Industrial age==\nBy 1834, an [[Habsburg Monarchy|imperial]] townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous [[development plan]], which divided the city roughly into two areas: The old part of the town \u2013 with its irregular building structures \u2013 and a newer City Center and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect [[Avraam Melnikov]] established the '[[Nativity Cathedral, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Catedrala Na\u015fterea Domnului]]'. In 1840 the building of the [[Triumphal arch, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Triumphal arch]], planned by the architect [[Luca Zaushkevich]], was completed.\n\n[[File:Chi\u0219in\u0103u 1889 1.jpg|thumb|left|Chi\u015fin\u0103u, 1889.]]\n\nSince 1983 the [[National History Museum of Moldova]] has housed in a building erected in 1837. Initially the building was the headquarters of the City Duma, but in 1842 it became the Gymnasium (High School) for Boys No. 1 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.\n\n[[File:Primaria Chisinau vechi-2.jpg|thumb|[[Chi\u015fin\u0103u City Hall]]]]\n\nOn August 28, 1871 Chi\u015fin\u0103u was linked by [[Calea Ferat\u0103 din Moldova|rail]] with [[Tiraspol]] and in 1873 with [[Corne\u015fti, Moldova|Corne\u015fti]]. Chi\u015fin\u0103u-[[Ungheni]]-[[Ia\u015fi]] railway was opened on June 1, 1875 in preparation for the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]]. The town played an important part in the war between Russia and [[Ottoman Empire]], as the main [[staging area]] of the Russian invasion.\n\nOne of the most known [[mayors of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] was [[Carol Schmidt]], who led the city between 1877-1903. [[Alexander Bernardazzi]] was an important architect who built [[St. Teodora de la Sihla Church]] (1895) and [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u City Hall]] (1901).\n\nA statue of [[Pushkin]], who used to stroll the [[\u015etefan cel Mare Central Park]] grounds in the early 1820s, was designed by [[Alexander Opekushin]] and erected in 1885, making Chi\u015fin\u0103u the second city after [[Moscow]] to have a Pushkin monument. Originally funded by the Chi\u015fin\u0103u inhabitants, it is the oldest surviving monument in the city.\n\n==Pogrom and pre-revolution==\n[[File:Chisinau winegrowers.jpg|thumb|Chi\u015fin\u0103u winegrowers about 1900]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the [[Russian Empire]] and better economic conditions, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862 and to 125,787 by 1900. By the year 1900, 43% of the population of Chi\u015fin\u0103u was [[Jew]]ish \u2013 one of the highest numbers in Europe.\n\n[[File:Kishinev elegy.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Kishinev pogrom|Chi\u015fin\u0103u pogrom]]]]\n\nA large [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] riot took place in the town on 6\u20137 April 1903, which would later be known as the [[Kishinev pogrom]]. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47\u201349 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official [[newspaper]] of the time, ''Bessarabetz'' (''\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a''). The reactions to this incident included a petition to [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] on behalf of [[United States|the American people]] by the US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in July 1905.<ref name=\"pogrom\">[http://kishinev.moldline.net/pogrom.html Virtual Kishinev], accessed 23 December 2007</ref>\n\nOn 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred, whereby the police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the [[October Manifesto]]. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.<ref name=\"pogrom\"/>\n\n''[[Basarabia (newspaper)|Basarabia]]'' was the first [[Romanian language]] newspaper to be published in [[Bessarabia in the Russian Empire|Bessarabian guberniya]] of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1906-1907. In March 1907, the newspaper published the Romanian patriotic song \"[[De\u015fteapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]\" and was closed. ''[[Via\u0163a Basarabiei, 1907|Via\u0163a Basarabiei]]'' was a more moderate attempt to continue ''Basarabia'''s work, but in May 1907, it also ceased its publication.

In April 1917 the party leadership was elected. It was headed by Vasile Stroescu, having among its members [[Paul Gore (historian)|Paul Gore]] (a renowned conservative), [[Vladimir Her\u0163a]], [[Pan Halippa]] (a renowned socialist), [[Onisifor Ghibu]].

The [[Agricultural State University of Moldova]] was founded in 1933 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The [[National Museum of Fine Arts, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Museum of Fine Arts]] was founded in 1939 by the sculptor [[Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103]]. [[Gurie Grosu]] was the first [[Metropolitan of Bessarabia]].\n\n[[Via\u0163a Basarabiei]] was founded in 1932 by [[Pan Halippa]] and [[Misionarul]] in 1929. [[Radio Basarabia]] was launched on 8 October 1939, as the second radio station of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]]. ''Writer and Journalist Bessarabian Society'' took an institutionalized form in 1940. First Congress of the Society elected as president [[Pan Halippa]] as Vice President [[Nicolae Sp\u0103taru]], and as secretary general [[Nicolae Costenco]].\n\nIn the interwar period [[mayors of Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] were [[Vladimir Hertza]], [[Teodor Cojocaru]], [[Iulian Levinski|I.

Those years the quantity of the city population was not increasing, and in June 1941 Chi\u015fin\u0103u had 110,000 people.\n\n==World War II==\nIn the chaos of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Chi\u015fin\u0103u was almost completely destroyed. This began with the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] by the [[Red Army]] on 28 June 1940. As the city began to recover from the takeover, a devastating earthquake occurred on 10 November 1940. The [[epicenter]] of the quake, which measured 7.3 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]], was in eastern [[Romania]] and subsequently led to substantial destruction in the city.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B13329, Russland, Ghetto Chisinau, J\u00fcdische Frauen.jpg|thumb|left|Chi\u015fin\u0103u Ghetto]]\n\nAfter scarcely one year, the assault on the newly created [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovan SSR]] by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and Romanian armies began. Beginning with July 1941 the city suffered from large-scale shooting and heavy bombardments by Nazi [[Strategic bombing|air raids]]. On 16 July 1941 the [[Romanian flag]] was hoisted over the dome of the '[[Nativity Cathedral, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Catedrala Na\u015fterea Domnului]]'. The Red Army resistance in Chi\u015fin\u0103u fell on 17 July 1941. [[Michael of Romania]] and [[Ion Antonescu]] visited Chi\u015fin\u0103u on 18 August 1941.\n\nFollowing the occupation, the city suffered from the characteristic [[mass murder]] of its predominantly Jewish inhabitants. As had been seen elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the Jews were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/MemKishIntro.html \"''Memories of the Holocaust: Kishinev (Chisinau) (1941-1944)''\" from jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref>\n\nAs the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once more pulled into heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. On 24 August 1944 the Soviet warriors entered the city as a result of the [[Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive (August 1944)|Jassy-Kishinev Operation]].\n\n==In the Soviet Union==\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully integrated into the Soviet Union. Most of Bessarabia became the Moldavian SSR with Chi\u015fin\u0103u as its capital; smaller parts of Bessarabia became parts of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].

Historically, the [[English language]] name for the city, \"Kishinev\", was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u015fin\u0103u was part of the [[Russian Empire]] (e.g. [[Kishinev pogrom]]). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, however, the Romanian-based \"Chi\u015fin\u0103u\" has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in the [[written language]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">\nFile:Chisinau bublik seller.jpg|Chi\u015fin\u0103u bublik seller\nFile:Chisinau home brewed beer seller.jpg|Chi\u015fin\u0103u home brewed beer seller\nFile:Chisinau pastry shop visitors.jpg|Chi\u015fin\u0103u pastry shop visitors\nFile:Chisinau agricultural exhibition jury 1889.jpg|Agricultural exhibition jury 1889: [[Carol Schmidt]] (center) is reading\nFile:Chisinau water carrier.jpg|Chi\u015fin\u0103u water carrier, about 1900\nFile:Gherman P\u00e2ntea (1894-1968).jpg|[[Gherman P\u00e2ntea]], [[Mayor of Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Mayor]]\nFile:Dumitru Bogos (1889-1946).jpg|[[Dimitrie Bogos]], [[Mayor of Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Mayor]]\nFile:Ion T.

The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance.<ref name=sb/> While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the [[Red Army]] temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|destroy the city in retaliation]]. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement during World War II]].<ref>{{cite book|first1= Eugeniusz |last1= Duraczy\u0144ski |first2= Jerzy Janusz |last2= Terej|title= Europa podziemna: 1939-1945 |year= 1974 |location= Warszawa |publisher= Wiedza Powszechna |oclc= 463203458 |language= Polish |trans-title= Europe underground: 1939-1945}}</ref>\n\nThe Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide [[Operation Tempest]], launched at the time of the Soviet [[Lublin\u2013Brest Offensive]]. The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] defeat [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. An additional, political goal of the [[Polish Underground State]] was to liberate Poland's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control.  Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for [[Death march#During World War II|\"evacuation\"]]; calls by [[Radio Moscow]]'s Polish Service for uprising; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=268, 271}}<ref>[https://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/okulicki.pdf Warsaw Uprising 1944] ''www.warsawuprising.com'', accessed 12 September 2019</ref>\n\nInitially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September, the eastern bank of the [[Vistula]] River opposite the Polish resistance positions was taken over by the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command]]; 1,200 men made it across the river, but they were not reinforced by the [[Red Army]]. This, and the lack of air support from the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed. [[Arthur Koestler]] called the Soviet attitude \"one of the major infamies of this war which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with [[Lidice Massacre|Lidice]].\"<ref>Koestler, letter in ''Tribune'' magazine 15 September 1944, reprinted in Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p.374</ref>\n\n[[Winston Churchill]] pleaded with Stalin and [[Franklin D.

Later, after gaining Soviet air clearance, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of [[Operation Frantic]].\n\nAlthough the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass executions. [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews being harboured by Poles]] were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled  over 2,000 to 17,000 soldiers killed and missing.<ref name=stachnik/> During the [[urban combat]], approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops systematically levelled another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the [[invasion of Poland|1939 invasion of Poland]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943, over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] forced the Germans to abandon the city.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Prelude to the Warsaw Uprising}}\n[[File:Flaga PPP.svg|thumb|White-and-red [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] with superposed \"[[Kotwica|anchor]]\" emblem of the Polish resistance]]\n[[File:Warszawa Powstanie 1944-08-04.png|thumb|Polish [[Home Army]] positions, outlined in red, on the western bank of the [[Vistula]] (4 August 1944)]]\nIn 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi Germany for almost five years.

At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk a lack of Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was liberated by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the [[Polish government-in-exile|London-based Polish government]] in the aftermath of the war. The urgency for a final decision on strategy increased as it became clear that, after successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of Polish territory (for example, in [[Operation Ostra Brama]]), [[NKVD|Soviet security forces]] behind the frontline shot or arrested Polish officers and forcibly conscripted lower ranks into the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Soviet-controlled forces]].<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>[http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/nkvd.htm The NKVD Against the Home Army (Armia Krajowa)], Warsaw Uprising, based on Andrzej Paczkowski.

The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:\n\n* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, [[PAST (Poland)|PAST]] skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]], the [[Nur f\u00fcr Deutsche|German-only]] area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of [[\u017boliborz]] through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela|Citadel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area II'' (\u017boliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near \u017boliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around \u017boliborz, the soldiers of Colonel Mieczys\u0142aw Niedzielski (\"\u017bywiciel\") failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa Gda\u0144ska station|Warsaw Gda\u0144sk]] railway station.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz (\"Rados\u0142aw\") managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] concentration camp, and the SS and [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski (\"Gustaw\") remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the [[Kedyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area V'' ([[Mokot\u00f3w]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street, and establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Mokot\u00f3w Field]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokot\u00f3w, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.<ref>Borowiec, p. 89.</ref>\n* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni \u017burowski (\"Andrzej\") were badly outnumbered by the Germans. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces were forced back underground.<ref name=\"wutime\"/>\n* ''Area VII'' (''[[Powiat]] warszawski''): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAn additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion or ''[[Kedyw]]'', an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an \"armed ambulance\", thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie and Wola; along with the units of ''Area I'', they were the most successful during the first few hours.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAmong the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of [[Ok\u0119cie]] and [[Mokot\u00f3w Field]], as well as the PAST skyscraper overlooking the city centre and the [[Warszawa Gda\u0144ska station|Gda\u0144sk railway station]] guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of \u017boliborz.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Wola massacre ===\n<!-- Please DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION - Thanks -->\n{{Main|Wola massacre}}\n[[File:Uprising defender.jpg|thumb|Home Army soldier armed with [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun]] defending a barricade in Powi\u015ble District of Warsaw during the Uprising, August 1944]]\n\nThe Uprising reached its [[apogee]] on 4 August when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of [[Wola]] and [[Ochota]].

German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of [[heavy artillery]]<ref>Davies, p. 282.</ref> and [[tactical bomber]]s, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons.

The Soviet army under the command of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] captured Praga and arrived on the east bank of the Vistula in mid-September. By 13 September, the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula, signalling that they were abandoning all their positions east of the river.<ref>Borowiec, pp.138\u2013141 and Davies, p. 332.</ref> In the Praga area, Polish units under the command of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] (thus sometimes known as ''berlingowcy'' \u2013 \"the Berling men\") fought on the Soviet side.

The artillery cover and air support provided by the Soviets was unable to effectively counter enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river, and the landing troops sustained heavy losses.<ref>Davies, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> Only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).<ref name=\"Berling landings\"/>\n\n[[File:POL Berling monument, Warsaw 01.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Monument to [[Zygmunt Berling|General Berling]] in Warsaw]]\n\nThe limited landings by the 1st Polish Army represented the only external ground force which arrived to physically support the uprising; and even they were curtailed by the Soviet High Command due to the losses they took.<ref name=\"Berling landings\"/>\n\nThe Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, but were not able to make any significant advances for several days while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for a new expected wave of Soviet landings.

Conditions that prevented the Germans from dislodging the resistance also acted to prevent the Poles from dislodging the Germans. Plans for a river crossing were suspended \"for at least 4 months\", since operations against the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] five [[panzer division]]s were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>Richard J.

However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the citizens of Warsaw lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The \"Sowi\u0144ski\" Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAnother serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house.

This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans, launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces, played out successfully in a number of European capitals, such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]]<ref>Davies, p. 304.</ref> and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, despite easy capture of area south-east of Warsaw barely {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the resistance within Warsaw. At that time city outskirts were defended by the under-manned and under-equipped [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 73rd Infantry Division]] which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet-again being reconstituted.<ref>''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941\u201345'' Relevant page viewable via [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&id=HAMd81LJJs4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=73rd+infantry+division&prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]</ref> The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period, which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself.\n\n[[File:Piesc-czujka.jpg|thumb|right|Soldier from \"Pi\u0119\u015b\u0107\" Battalion led by Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski \"Agaton\", pictured on a rooftop of a house near the Evangelic Cemetery in Wola District of Warsaw, 2 August 1944]]\n\nThe Red Army was fighting intense battles further to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north of the city, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite the fact, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by September. Yet the Soviet 47th Army did not move into [[Praga]] (Warsaw's suburbs) on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the Uprising was basically over). In three days the Soviets quickly gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd Division collapsed quickly. Had the Soviets done this in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[Czerniak\u00f3w]]. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling's communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance.

[[Zygmunt Berling]] became the deputy commander of the Polish Army in the USSR on 22 July 1944. With his own army stopped on the [[Vistula River]] and facing Warsaw itself, and without first consulting his Soviet superiors, Berling may have independently issued orders to engage the German enemy and to come to the aid of the Polish resistance. But it was a small landing without any tactical support from Berling or other Soviet units that could not make a difference in the situation of Warsaw.

The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold.<ref>Davies, p. 320.</ref> Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany.<ref>Davies, p. 417.</ref> The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed.<ref>Davies, p. 418.</ref> Propaganda from the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers.<ref>Davies, pp. 440\u2013441.</ref> Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details.<ref>e.g. Davies, pp. 154\u2013155, 388\u2013389.</ref> Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, they \"deliberately resorted to writing nonsense\".<ref>Davies, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Glantz]] (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation's Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin's political intentions.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>  German military capabilities in August\u2014early September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>\n\nDeclassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed. Only from mid-September, under pressure from the Western Allies, the Soviets began to provide some limited assistance to the resistance.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/>\n\nModern Russian historians generally hold the view that the failure of the uprising in Warsaw was caused primarily by the mistakes of the leadership of the uprising. They point out that in July 1944, according to the Directive of the command, the Soviet troops did not have the goal of attacking Warsaw, but only to the suburbs of Warsaw - Prague with access to the Vistula river line. Since the Soviet command understood that it was unlikely to be possible to capture the bridges over the Vistula and the Germans would blow them up. The Soviet forces aimed to advance in the northern direction with the capture of East Prussia and with the priority task of reaching the line of the Vistula and Narew rivers and capturing bridgeheads.

The liberation of Warsaw was planned by a flanking maneuver after the start of a General offensive in the direction of East Prussia and Berlin. This is exactly how it happened, only in January 1945. The AK leadership made a mistake, it took the left flank of the 2nd Tank army, which was advancing to north, for the vanguard, which was allegedly advancing on Warsaw. And the order was given to start the uprising, which led to defeat. A terrible mistake, but in essence inevitable, if the leadership of the uprising took a political line about the lack of coordination with the Soviet command, if the goal was - Warsaw should be freed from the Germans 'by Polish effort alone 12 hours before the entry of the Soviets into the capital'.<ref>Jan.

Hungarians and Poles have maintained very friendly relations for centuries and neither individual soldiers nor their commanders wished to break this tradition. Hungarian military bands often played Polish patriotic songs and anthems which were banned under the death penalty by the Germans, or rendered aid in their field hospitals to wounded Polish partisans. Although their troops were formally subordinated to the German 9th army, they refused to participate in the quelling of the uprising. Instead they supported the Polish side as much as it was possible without actually switching sides and getting into an open conflict with the Germans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benk\u0151 |first1=Tibor |title=Memorial to Hungarian soldiers assisting 1944 Warsaw uprising is inaugurated in Warsaw |url=https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/memorial-to-hungarian-soldiers-assisting-1944-warsaw-uprising-is-inaugurated-in-warsaw |website=Hungarian Government Website |publisher=Ministry of Defense |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince August 1943 the elite Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division were stationed on the outskirts of the Polish capital, in the forests of Kampinos. The unit was withdrawn from the front for recuperation and refitting. When the uprising began, the Hungarian soldiers passed equipment, food, supplies, even weapons and ammunition to Polish fighters who they were supposed to disarm and capture. They also informed them about German plans and troop movements. Very often the two sides agreed to feign a \"partisan attack\" on supply vehicles, and after a mock firefight the Hungarians \"fled\" and let the Poles \"pillage\" their supplies, which often included large shipments of firearms. At other times they let Polish units through their lines but blocked the way from Germans who were chasing them. At other times individual Polish soldiers found asylum at Hungarian units who \"captured\" and refused to extradite them to the Germans. There were several incidents when Hungarian soldiers threatened Germans with weapons to protect these refugees. When the Germans ordered the 5th Hungarian infantry division to withdraw from Warsaw's vicinity, they left behind equipment and ammunition for the partisans. They also frequently provided them with Hungarian uniforms. Ironically the Poles and the Hungarians mostly communicated in German language which they both knew.\n\nDuring one event, when the German radio reconnaissance successfully located a strategically important Polish radio station, the Hungarian radio operators thwarted the German raid to capture the station by jamming German radio frequencies.\n\nThe 23rd Reserve Division, commanded by Major General Guszt\u00e1v Dese\u0151 passed on information to the Polish partisans about which bridges can be destroyed in the area without making the Germans suspicious of the Hungarians. In the area between the towns of Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki and Radom, near Diabla G\u00f3ra (Devil's Hill) the same unit got into a firefight with an approximately 200-strong German military police detachment and freed several hundred Polish and Jewish prisoners from a train headed to the concentration camp at Pruszk\u00f3w.\n\nThis cooperation wasn't unofficial or occasional. General Antal Vattay, commander of the Hungarian troops was in secret talks of the leadership of the Polish resistance and held several meetings at various locations. These negotiations were conducted with the knowledge and permission of the Hungarian government and personally Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Regent of Hungary. As it was feared that the Germans may try to arrest Vattay, he was recalled to Budapest and replaced with General B\u00e9la Lengyel, who used to be the military attach\u00e9 to the Hungarian embassy in Warsaw before the war. If possible, he was even more sympathetic to the Polish case than his predecessor and personally knew some of the leaders of the Polish resistance, including General B\u00f3r-Komorowski. Ultimately the Hungarians offered to switch sides and openly engage German troops in combat if the Polish leaders could provide guarantees that the Soviets later won't treat them as enemy combatants. As the Poles were not in the position to make such assurances, this never happened.\n\nThere also are several recorded cases of Hungarian soldiers defecting to the Polish side and fighting with them. Some of them died in the firefights, and some were executed by the Germans. The 1st Cavalry Division also participated in the rescue of Polish civilians from German atrocities. At least 1600 Warsaw families got away from SS troops on Hungarian military vehicles. Many of them were smuggled to Hungary. Ksenia Martysz\u00f3wna, a famous Polish interwar actress, known as Xenia Grey, was one of them.<ref>A magyar korridor: Vars\u00f3 1944 (The Hungarian Corridor: Warsaw 1944) Documentary, 2016, directed by Levente Jamrik</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-054-30, Warschauer Aufstand, polnischer Soldat.jpg|thumb|Home Army soldier from the Mokot\u00f3w District surrenders to German troops.

Though the figure of 9,000 German WIA is generally accepted and generates no controversy, there is little agreement as to German irrecoverable losses (KIA+MIA). Until the 1990s the Eastern and the Western historiography stuck to two widely different estimates, the former claiming 17,000 and the latter 2,000. The 17,000 figure was first coined by a 1947 issue of a Warsaw historical journal ''Dzieje Najnowsze'', allegedly based on estimates made by Bach Zelewski when interrogated by his Polish captors (and divided into 10,000 KIA and 7,000 MIA). This figure was initially repeated in West Germany.<ref>e.g. a German scholar specialized in Polish history, Hans E. Roos, in ''Der Tag'' of 01.08.1954 repeated the 17,000 KIA+MIA figure, referred after Klaus-Peter Friedrich, ''Kontaminierte Erinnerung: Vom Einflu\u00df der Kriegspropaganda auf das Gedenken an die Warschauer Aufst\u00e4nde von 1943 und 1944'', [in:] ''Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung'' 55/3 ( 2008), p. 427</ref> However, in 1962 a scholarly monograph by Hanns Krannhals coined the 2,000 estimate.<ref>\"auf deutscher Seite w\u00e4hrend des Aufstandes 2 000 Angeh\u00f6rige deutsch gef\u00fchrer Verb\u00e4nde gefallen und 9 000 verwunder worden sind\", see Hanns von Krannhals, ''Der Warschauer Aufstand'', Frankfurt a/M 1962, p. 215; Krannhals dismissed the 17,000 figure as \"Bach\u2019s overestimates which unfortunately made it to the Polish literature\"</ref> It was based on the 1,570 German KIA figure officially reported by Bach in October 1944, rounded up with estimates related to first few days when Bach was not in charge and to losses suffered by [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19. PzDiv]] (not subordinate to Bach), briefly engaged against the Poles in Northern Warsaw during last days of the fightings.\n\nUntil the late 20th century the 17,000 figure was consistently and unequivocally quoted in the Polish, though also in the East German and Soviet historiography, be it encyclopedias,<ref>see e.g. Kazimierz Sobczak (ed.), ''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', Warszawa 1975, p. 626</ref> scientific monographs<ref>see e.g. Jerzy Kirchmayer, ''Powstanie Warszawskie, Warszawa 1978'', ISBN  {{ISBN|830511080X}}, p. 576</ref> or more popular works.<ref>see e.g. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, ''1859 dni Warszawy'', Warszawa 1982, {{ISBN|8370061524}}, p. 758</ref> It was at times paired or otherwise related to the figure of 16,000 German Warsaw KIA+MIA listed by the so-called ''Gehlen report'' of April 1945.<ref>see e.g. Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Militarne aspekty powstania warszawskiego'', [in:] Marek M. Drozdowski (ed.), ''Powstanie Warszawskie z perspektywy p\u00f3\u0142wiecza'', Warszawa 1995, {{ISBN|8386301104}}, p. 129</ref> The 2,000 figure was accepted in West Germany and generally spilled over to Western historiography;<ref>see e.g. Gunther Deschner, ''Warsaw rising'', New York 1972, p. 175</ref> exceptions were studies written in English by the Poles<ref>see e.g. Janusz Kazimierz Zawodny, ''Nothing But Honour: The Story of the Warsaw Uprising'', 1944, Washington 1978, {{ISBN|9780817968311}}</ref> and some other works.<ref>see e.g. ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress'', Washington 1983, p. 16309</ref>\n\nRecently the Polish historiography has been increasingly turning towards the 2,000 figure. Komorowski, who in 1995 opted for 16,000, changed his mind and 10 years later cautiously subscribed to the 2,000 figure;<ref>Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Bitwa o Warszaw\u0119 \u201944'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|9788373991330}}, p.  271</ref> also scholars like Sawicki<ref>Tadeusz Sawicki, ''Rozkaz: zd\u0142awi\u0107 Powstanie'', Warszwa 2001, {{ISBN|9788311092846}}, p. 189</ref> and Rozwadowski<ref>Piotr Rozwadowski, ''Warszawa 1944-1945'', Warszawa 2006, {{ISBN|8311104808}}, pp. 110-111</ref> tentatively followed suit.

In literature, they include: ''Kolumbowie. Rocznik 20'' novel by Polish writer Roman Bratny.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn television, they include documentary film ''The ramparts of Warsaw 1943-44'', produced for the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising with support from the European Commission. The Warsaw Uprising is often confused with the revolt in the Warsaw Ghetto which took place a year earlier in the Spring of 1943. Three young Europeans, Alexandra (France), Maria (Poland) and Roman (Germany) meet in Warsaw to enquire into these events; here they meet witnesses who took part in the Warsaw Uprising or lived in the ghetto. Beneath their white hair we can recognise the men and women who formed the living ramparts of freedom in the face of Nazism. Meanwhile, the Polish World War II TV drama series ''[[Czas honoru|Time Of Honor]]'' (''Czas honoru''; Series 7), which aired in 2014, was entirely devoted to the Warsaw Uprising.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.\n\nIn cinema, they include:\n\n*[[Kana\u0142]], a 1956 Polish film directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]].

The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance.<ref name=sb/> While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the [[Red Army]] temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|destroy the city in retaliation]]. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement during World War II]].<ref>{{cite book|first1= Eugeniusz |last1= Duraczy\u0144ski |first2= Jerzy Janusz |last2= Terej|title= Europa podziemna: 1939-1945 |year= 1974 |location= Warszawa |publisher= Wiedza Powszechna |oclc= 463203458 |language= Polish |trans-title= Europe underground: 1939-1945}}</ref>\n\nThe Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide [[Operation Tempest]], launched at the time of the Soviet [[Lublin\u2013Brest Offensive]]. The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] defeat [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. An additional, political goal of the [[Polish Underground State]] was to liberate Poland's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control.  Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for [[Death march#During World War II|\"evacuation\"]]; calls by [[Radio Moscow]]'s Polish Service for uprising; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=268, 271}}<ref>[https://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/okulicki.pdf Warsaw Uprising 1944] ''www.warsawuprising.com'', accessed 12 September 2019</ref>\n\nInitially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September, the eastern bank of the [[Vistula]] River opposite the Polish resistance positions was taken over by the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command]]; 1,200 men made it across the river, but they were not reinforced by the [[Red Army]]. This, and the lack of air support from the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed. [[Arthur Koestler]] called the Soviet attitude \"one of the major infamies of this war which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with [[Lidice Massacre|Lidice]].\"<ref>Koestler, letter in ''Tribune'' magazine 15 September 1944, reprinted in Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p.374</ref>\n\n[[Winston Churchill]] pleaded with Stalin and [[Franklin D.

Later, after gaining Soviet air clearance, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of [[Operation Frantic]].\n\nAlthough the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass executions. [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews being harboured by Poles]] were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled  over 2,000 to 17,000 soldiers killed and missing.<ref name=stachnik/> During the [[urban combat]], approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops systematically levelled another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the [[invasion of Poland|1939 invasion of Poland]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943, over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] forced the Germans to abandon the city.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Prelude to the Warsaw Uprising}}\n[[File:Flaga PPP.svg|thumb|White-and-red [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] with superposed \"[[Kotwica|anchor]]\" emblem of the Polish resistance]]\n[[File:Warszawa Powstanie 1944-08-04.png|thumb|Polish [[Home Army]] positions, outlined in red, on the western bank of the [[Vistula]] (4 August 1944)]]\nIn 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi Germany for almost five years. The [[Armia Krajowa|Polish Home Army]] planned some form of rebellion against German forces. Germany was fighting a coalition of [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], led by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. The initial plan of the Home Army was to link up with the invading forces of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] as they liberated Europe from the Nazis. However, when the Soviet Army began its offensive in 1943, it became clear that Poland would be liberated by it instead of the Western Allies.\n\n{{quote|In this country, we have one point from which every evil emanates.

On the approach of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], local units of the Home Army were to harass the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in the rear and co-operate with incoming Soviet units as much as possible.

At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk a lack of Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was liberated by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the [[Polish government-in-exile|London-based Polish government]] in the aftermath of the war. The urgency for a final decision on strategy increased as it became clear that, after successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of Polish territory (for example, in [[Operation Ostra Brama]]), [[NKVD|Soviet security forces]] behind the frontline shot or arrested Polish officers and forcibly conscripted lower ranks into the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Soviet-controlled forces]].<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>[http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/nkvd.htm The NKVD Against the Home Army (Armia Krajowa)], Warsaw Uprising, based on Andrzej Paczkowski.

The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:\n\n* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, [[PAST (Poland)|PAST]] skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]], the [[Nur f\u00fcr Deutsche|German-only]] area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of [[\u017boliborz]] through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela|Citadel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area II'' (\u017boliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near \u017boliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around \u017boliborz, the soldiers of Colonel Mieczys\u0142aw Niedzielski (\"\u017bywiciel\") failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa Gda\u0144ska station|Warsaw Gda\u0144sk]] railway station.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz (\"Rados\u0142aw\") managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] concentration camp, and the SS and [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski (\"Gustaw\") remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the [[Kedyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area V'' ([[Mokot\u00f3w]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street, and establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Mokot\u00f3w Field]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokot\u00f3w, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.<ref>Borowiec, p. 89.</ref>\n* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni \u017burowski (\"Andrzej\") were badly outnumbered by the Germans.

Plans for a river crossing were suspended \"for at least 4 months\", since operations against the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] five [[panzer division]]s were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>Richard J.

Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country.

However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the citizens of Warsaw lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The \"Sowi\u0144ski\" Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAnother serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On 21 September the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa Street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city.<ref name=\"Stacja Filtr\u00f3w\"/> By the end of September, the city centre had more than 90 functioning wells.<ref name=\"wutime\"/>\n\n=== Polish media ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\n{{Listen|filename=Warsaw Uprising broadcast.ogg|title=Polish Radio broadcast in English|description=A news programme on the daily fights in Warsaw |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nBefore the Uprising the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Home Army had set up a group of war correspondents.

This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans, launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces, played out successfully in a number of European capitals, such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]]<ref>Davies, p. 304.</ref> and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, despite easy capture of area south-east of Warsaw barely {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the resistance within Warsaw. At that time city outskirts were defended by the under-manned and under-equipped [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 73rd Infantry Division]] which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet-again being reconstituted.<ref>''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941\u201345'' Relevant page viewable via [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&id=HAMd81LJJs4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=73rd+infantry+division&prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]</ref> The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period, which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself.\n\n[[File:Piesc-czujka.jpg|thumb|right|Soldier from \"Pi\u0119\u015b\u0107\" Battalion led by Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski \"Agaton\", pictured on a rooftop of a house near the Evangelic Cemetery in Wola District of Warsaw, 2 August 1944]]\n\nThe Red Army was fighting intense battles further to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north of the city, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite the fact, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by September. Yet the Soviet 47th Army did not move into [[Praga]] (Warsaw's suburbs) on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the Uprising was basically over). In three days the Soviets quickly gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd Division collapsed quickly. Had the Soviets done this in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[Czerniak\u00f3w]]. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling's communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance.

[[Zygmunt Berling]] became the deputy commander of the Polish Army in the USSR on 22 July 1944. With his own army stopped on the [[Vistula River]] and facing Warsaw itself, and without first consulting his Soviet superiors, Berling may have independently issued orders to engage the German enemy and to come to the aid of the Polish resistance. But it was a small landing without any tactical support from Berling or other Soviet units that could not make a difference in the situation of Warsaw.  Yet this behaviour may have caused Berlings' dismissal from his post soon after.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michta | first = Andrew | title = Red Eagle : the army in Polish politics, 1944-1988 | publisher = Hoover Institution Press | location = Stanford, Calif | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-8179-8862-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/redeaglearmyinpo0000mich }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ff065RmrAsC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=Zygmunt+Berling&source=bl&ots=BByFDI04Yb&sig=ZKvo7XnXDs__Qze3agX4YwHTe3A&hl=en&ei=lP4oS6LSCo3c7AOg7ZHEBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Zygmunt%20Berling&f=false p. 33].

The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold.<ref>Davies, p. 320.</ref> Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany.<ref>Davies, p. 417.</ref> The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed.<ref>Davies, p. 418.</ref> Propaganda from the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers.<ref>Davies, pp. 440\u2013441.</ref> Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details.<ref>e.g. Davies, pp. 154\u2013155, 388\u2013389.</ref> Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, they \"deliberately resorted to writing nonsense\".<ref>Davies, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Glantz]] (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation's Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin's political intentions.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>  German military capabilities in August\u2014early September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>\n\nDeclassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed. Only from mid-September, under pressure from the Western Allies, the Soviets began to provide some limited assistance to the resistance.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/>\n\nModern Russian historians generally hold the view that the failure of the uprising in Warsaw was caused primarily by the mistakes of the leadership of the uprising. They point out that in July 1944, according to the Directive of the command, the Soviet troops did not have the goal of attacking Warsaw, but only to the suburbs of Warsaw - Prague with access to the Vistula river line. Since the Soviet command understood that it was unlikely to be possible to capture the bridges over the Vistula and the Germans would blow them up. The Soviet forces aimed to advance in the northern direction with the capture of East Prussia and with the priority task of reaching the line of the Vistula and Narew rivers and capturing bridgeheads. Then the offensive against East Prussia was to begin from these bridgeheads.

The liberation of Warsaw was planned by a flanking maneuver after the start of a General offensive in the direction of East Prussia and Berlin. This is exactly how it happened, only in January 1945. The AK leadership made a mistake, it took the left flank of the 2nd Tank army, which was advancing to north, for the vanguard, which was allegedly advancing on Warsaw. And the order was given to start the uprising, which led to defeat. A terrible mistake, but in essence inevitable, if the leadership of the uprising took a political line about the lack of coordination with the Soviet command, if the goal was - Warsaw should be freed from the Germans 'by Polish effort alone 12 hours before the entry of the Soviets into the capital'.<ref>Jan.

Hungarians and Poles have maintained very friendly relations for centuries and neither individual soldiers nor their commanders wished to break this tradition. Hungarian military bands often played Polish patriotic songs and anthems which were banned under the death penalty by the Germans, or rendered aid in their field hospitals to wounded Polish partisans. Although their troops were formally subordinated to the German 9th army, they refused to participate in the quelling of the uprising. Instead they supported the Polish side as much as it was possible without actually switching sides and getting into an open conflict with the Germans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benk\u0151 |first1=Tibor |title=Memorial to Hungarian soldiers assisting 1944 Warsaw uprising is inaugurated in Warsaw |url=https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/memorial-to-hungarian-soldiers-assisting-1944-warsaw-uprising-is-inaugurated-in-warsaw |website=Hungarian Government Website |publisher=Ministry of Defense |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince August 1943 the elite Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division were stationed on the outskirts of the Polish capital, in the forests of Kampinos. The unit was withdrawn from the front for recuperation and refitting. When the uprising began, the Hungarian soldiers passed equipment, food, supplies, even weapons and ammunition to Polish fighters who they were supposed to disarm and capture. They also informed them about German plans and troop movements. Very often the two sides agreed to feign a \"partisan attack\" on supply vehicles, and after a mock firefight the Hungarians \"fled\" and let the Poles \"pillage\" their supplies, which often included large shipments of firearms. At other times they let Polish units through their lines but blocked the way from Germans who were chasing them. At other times individual Polish soldiers found asylum at Hungarian units who \"captured\" and refused to extradite them to the Germans. There were several incidents when Hungarian soldiers threatened Germans with weapons to protect these refugees. When the Germans ordered the 5th Hungarian infantry division to withdraw from Warsaw's vicinity, they left behind equipment and ammunition for the partisans. They also frequently provided them with Hungarian uniforms. Ironically the Poles and the Hungarians mostly communicated in German language which they both knew.\n\nDuring one event, when the German radio reconnaissance successfully located a strategically important Polish radio station, the Hungarian radio operators thwarted the German raid to capture the station by jamming German radio frequencies.\n\nThe 23rd Reserve Division, commanded by Major General Guszt\u00e1v Dese\u0151 passed on information to the Polish partisans about which bridges can be destroyed in the area without making the Germans suspicious of the Hungarians. In the area between the towns of Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki and Radom, near Diabla G\u00f3ra (Devil's Hill) the same unit got into a firefight with an approximately 200-strong German military police detachment and freed several hundred Polish and Jewish prisoners from a train headed to the concentration camp at Pruszk\u00f3w.\n\nThis cooperation wasn't unofficial or occasional. General Antal Vattay, commander of the Hungarian troops was in secret talks of the leadership of the Polish resistance and held several meetings at various locations. These negotiations were conducted with the knowledge and permission of the Hungarian government and personally Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Regent of Hungary. As it was feared that the Germans may try to arrest Vattay, he was recalled to Budapest and replaced with General B\u00e9la Lengyel, who used to be the military attach\u00e9 to the Hungarian embassy in Warsaw before the war. If possible, he was even more sympathetic to the Polish case than his predecessor and personally knew some of the leaders of the Polish resistance, including General B\u00f3r-Komorowski. Ultimately the Hungarians offered to switch sides and openly engage German troops in combat if the Polish leaders could provide guarantees that the Soviets later won't treat them as enemy combatants. As the Poles were not in the position to make such assurances, this never happened.\n\nThere also are several recorded cases of Hungarian soldiers defecting to the Polish side and fighting with them. Some of them died in the firefights, and some were executed by the Germans. The 1st Cavalry Division also participated in the rescue of Polish civilians from German atrocities. At least 1600 Warsaw families got away from SS troops on Hungarian military vehicles. Many of them were smuggled to Hungary. Ksenia Martysz\u00f3wna, a famous Polish interwar actress, known as Xenia Grey, was one of them.<ref>A magyar korridor: Vars\u00f3 1944 (The Hungarian Corridor: Warsaw 1944) Documentary, 2016, directed by Levente Jamrik</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-054-30, Warschauer Aufstand, polnischer Soldat.jpg|thumb|Home Army soldier from the Mokot\u00f3w District surrenders to German troops.

Though the figure of 9,000 German WIA is generally accepted and generates no controversy, there is little agreement as to German irrecoverable losses (KIA+MIA). Until the 1990s the Eastern and the Western historiography stuck to two widely different estimates, the former claiming 17,000 and the latter 2,000. The 17,000 figure was first coined by a 1947 issue of a Warsaw historical journal ''Dzieje Najnowsze'', allegedly based on estimates made by Bach Zelewski when interrogated by his Polish captors (and divided into 10,000 KIA and 7,000 MIA). This figure was initially repeated in West Germany.<ref>e.g. a German scholar specialized in Polish history, Hans E. Roos, in ''Der Tag'' of 01.08.1954 repeated the 17,000 KIA+MIA figure, referred after Klaus-Peter Friedrich, ''Kontaminierte Erinnerung: Vom Einflu\u00df der Kriegspropaganda auf das Gedenken an die Warschauer Aufst\u00e4nde von 1943 und 1944'', [in:] ''Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung'' 55/3 ( 2008), p. 427</ref> However, in 1962 a scholarly monograph by Hanns Krannhals coined the 2,000 estimate.<ref>\"auf deutscher Seite w\u00e4hrend des Aufstandes 2 000 Angeh\u00f6rige deutsch gef\u00fchrer Verb\u00e4nde gefallen und 9 000 verwunder worden sind\", see Hanns von Krannhals, ''Der Warschauer Aufstand'', Frankfurt a/M 1962, p. 215; Krannhals dismissed the 17,000 figure as \"Bach\u2019s overestimates which unfortunately made it to the Polish literature\"</ref> It was based on the 1,570 German KIA figure officially reported by Bach in October 1944, rounded up with estimates related to first few days when Bach was not in charge and to losses suffered by [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19. PzDiv]] (not subordinate to Bach), briefly engaged against the Poles in Northern Warsaw during last days of the fightings.\n\nUntil the late 20th century the 17,000 figure was consistently and unequivocally quoted in the Polish, though also in the East German and Soviet historiography, be it encyclopedias,<ref>see e.g. Kazimierz Sobczak (ed.), ''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', Warszawa 1975, p. 626</ref> scientific monographs<ref>see e.g. Jerzy Kirchmayer, ''Powstanie Warszawskie, Warszawa 1978'', ISBN  {{ISBN|830511080X}}, p. 576</ref> or more popular works.<ref>see e.g. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, ''1859 dni Warszawy'', Warszawa 1982, {{ISBN|8370061524}}, p. 758</ref> It was at times paired or otherwise related to the figure of 16,000 German Warsaw KIA+MIA listed by the so-called ''Gehlen report'' of April 1945.<ref>see e.g. Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Militarne aspekty powstania warszawskiego'', [in:] Marek M. Drozdowski (ed.), ''Powstanie Warszawskie z perspektywy p\u00f3\u0142wiecza'', Warszawa 1995, {{ISBN|8386301104}}, p. 129</ref> The 2,000 figure was accepted in West Germany and generally spilled over to Western historiography;<ref>see e.g. Gunther Deschner, ''Warsaw rising'', New York 1972, p. 175</ref> exceptions were studies written in English by the Poles<ref>see e.g. Janusz Kazimierz Zawodny, ''Nothing But Honour: The Story of the Warsaw Uprising'', 1944, Washington 1978, {{ISBN|9780817968311}}</ref> and some other works.<ref>see e.g. ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress'', Washington 1983, p. 16309</ref>\n\nRecently the Polish historiography has been increasingly turning towards the 2,000 figure. Komorowski, who in 1995 opted for 16,000, changed his mind and 10 years later cautiously subscribed to the 2,000 figure;<ref>Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Bitwa o Warszaw\u0119 \u201944'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|9788373991330}}, p.  271</ref> also scholars like Sawicki<ref>Tadeusz Sawicki, ''Rozkaz: zd\u0142awi\u0107 Powstanie'', Warszwa 2001, {{ISBN|9788311092846}}, p. 189</ref> and Rozwadowski<ref>Piotr Rozwadowski, ''Warszawa 1944-1945'', Warszawa 2006, {{ISBN|8311104808}}, pp. 110-111</ref> tentatively followed suit. The discrepancy is tackled head-on in a popular work of B\u0105czyk,<ref>Norbert B\u0105czyk, ''Ilu naprawd\u0119 poleg\u0142o w powstaniu warszawskim'', [in:] ''Tygodnik Polityka'' 42 (2014), pp. 54-56</ref> who concludes that 3,000 is the maximum conceivable (though not the most probable) figure. In his 2016 analysis Sowa dismissed the 17,000 figure as \u201centirely improbable\u201d and suggested that its longevity and popularity resulted from manipulation on part of apologists of the Rising.<ref>Andrzej Leon Sowa, ''Kto wyda\u0142 wyrok na miasto?'', Krak\u00f3w 2016, {{ISBN|9788308060957}}, pp. 617-618. The claim should be taken with caution; the 17,000 figure was systematically reproduced also in the Communist propaganda, which first lambasted the Rising as criminal suicidal act and later approached it at least with great deal of skepticism</ref>  In popular discourse in Poland the 17,000 figure still remains in wide circulation.<ref>it is advanced e.g. by ''Dzieje.pl'', a website operated by a number of official Polish institutions, compare [http://dzieje.pl/infografiki/polskie-i-niemieckie-straty-w-powstaniu-warszawskim here]</ref> Popular media seem bewildered; the most popular Polish internet portal ''[[Onet.pl|Onet]]'' in its news section favors the 2,000 figure<ref>compare the ''Onet'' news section, available [http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/powstanie-warszawskie-ile-trwalo-data-mapa-skutki-infografika/s7n9s1 here]</ref> and in its educational section opts for 17,000.<ref>compare the ''Onet'' educational service, available [http://klasowka.onet.pl/podrecznik/poznac-przeszlosc-wiek-xx-klasa-1-liceum/podrozdzial-rozdzial-iv-powstanie-warszawskie/wytlumaczenie here]</ref>\n\nBeyond Poland and Germany both figures remain in circulation, though the ones of 16-17,000 seem to be on the rise.<ref>see e.g. a booklet from the popular Osprey series, which claims 16,000 German KIA, Robert Forczyk, ''Warsaw 1944'', Bloomsbury 2009, {{ISBN|9781846033520}}, p. 89</ref> In the Russian historiography it is given clear preference, be it in encyclopedias and dictionaries<ref>see e.g. the entry ''\u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0430'', [in:] \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0432, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, ''\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 1941\u20131945 \u0433\u0433. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c'', \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2017, {{ISBN|9785040341412}}</ref> or general works;<ref>see e.g. \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0432, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, ''\u041d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f?'', \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2017, {{ISBN|9785457906037}}, p. 437</ref> the same opinion might be found in Belorussia.<ref>''\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u044b\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0434\u044b\u044f'', vol. 4, \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a 1997, {{ISBN|9789851100909}}, p. 17.

Its east boundary line abuts the west boundary line of the state of [[Wisconsin]] (across the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin\u2013Minnesota)|Saint Croix River]]). The Saint Croix flows south-southeasterly along the county's east border. The [[Sunrise River]] flows northerly through the central part of the county, collecting the waters of the North Branch Sunrise River and Hay Creek before discharging into the St. Croix at the county's east boundary.

Sculptor [[Ian Dudley]]'s bronze statue of the author stands in Chisago City's park. His fictional characters Karl-Oskar and Kristina Nilsson from Ljuder parish in [[Sm\u00e5land]] settled around the Lake Ki-Chi-Saga (from the [[Ojibwe language]] ''Ki-chi-saga-igun'' (''Gichi-zaaga'igan'' in the contemporary spelling) meaning \"Big Lake-with-an-outlet,\" which was later shortened to [[Chisago Lake Township, Chisago County, Minnesota|Lake Chisago]]).

Sculptor [[Ian Dudley]]'s bronze statue of the author stands in Chisago City\u2019s park. His fictional characters Karl-Oskar and Kristina Nilsson from Ljuder parish in [[Sm\u00e5land]] settled around the Lake Ki-Chi-Saga (from the [[Ojibwe language]] ''Ki-chi-saga-igun'' (''Gichi-zaaga'igan'' in the contemporary spelling) meaning \"Big Lake-with-an-outlet,\" which was later shortened to [[Chisago Lake Township, Chisago County, Minnesota|Lake Chisago]]).

They turned professional in 2010 and joined the [[I-League]] in 2007. They were relegated to the [[I-League 2nd Division]] in 2007 however they made it back up one year later.\n\nIn 2011 after facing finical trouble the club was brought out by Chirag Computers and changed the club's name to Chirag United Club Kerala which is what they are named today.\n\n==Foundation and life as Viva Kerala (2004-2011)==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Viva Kerala.png|thumb|right|The former ''Viva Kerala FC'' crest used from 2004 to 2011]] -->\nFormed on 8 August 2004 the club officially took off on 19 August in a ceremony at FACT grounds.  The club was formed by group of businessmen who felt the need for the state's representation in country's top football league, the [[National Football League (India)|National Football League]] (NFL). Viva Kerala's name is the result of a contest, won by Dr. P Ramakrishnan of [[Ernakulam]].\n\nThe objective was to prepare a team for the EDFA (Ernakulam District Football Association) Super League and State League in the first year and National Football League (2nd Division) in the second year. The ultimate aim is to eventually be the number one football team of India.\n\nViva Kerala focused on getting young and talented local players. Viva started its journey under the stewardship of former NFL winner T K Chathunni. In its first year, Viva defeated top clubs like Mohammedan Sporting, Titanium XI etc. and gained prominence. In 2006, Viva Kerala won a Cup held in Tirur; teams from all parts of the country participated in the tournament, such as State Bank of Travancore and Punjab Police. This period also saw the rise of a young Nigerian striker \u2013 Badmus Baba Thunde. Viva Kerala won the 3rd Division National Football League. In the end of the season, A M Sreedharan replaced Chathunni as the club's new coach.\n\nThe opportunity for an NFL spot came in the way of Second Division NFL. Viva surprised everyone by finishing second in its group and qualified for the final phase with the likes of Salgaocar SC and Chirag United. In the final phase, Viva Kerala finished as runners-up of the Second Division NFL to book their place in the National Football League 2007/08 on 6 April 2007. The combination of Baba Thunde and PK Anil Kumar was one of the main factors in the success of Viva Kerala. In midfield Denson Devadas was very effective while defence was led by captain Dhanarajan and Ombalaji. Sreedharan's strict training made them competitive at the top level.\n\nUnfortunately there was a slight hiccup in the path top glory for VIVA Kerala, when the club were relegated back to 2nd division at the end of I-league 2008. Nevertheless, Viva Kerala were invited back to Division 1 of the I-League for season [[I-League 2009\u201310|2009-2010]].\n\nViva Kerala lost many good players in offseason to other teams, they strengthened the team by signing U-19 players  from Viva Kerala U-19 and chandini FC. It was made official at a press conference in Kochi that Musli Power X-tra of Kunnath Pharmaceuticals would be the main sponsor of Viva Kerala. Kunnath Pharma's K.C. Abraham became the Director on the Viva Kerala board and he added \"This is not a one or a two-year deal\u2026this is for life\". Meanwhile, the team has been strengthened by the inclusion of experienced midfielder K Kulothungan and the Nigerian Mangut. Viva has followed their traditional style of searching for local talents and added the likes of Javed, Shamil, Sajin and Faisal to the squad. O K Javed has already made his mark as a decent striker with his exploits for Chandni FC, but only time will tell whether he can make it big with Viva Kerala.\n\nI-League clubs need to complete the AFC club licensing criteria; in order to do so, Viva has roped in the services of P.K Kunhikrishnan (A-licensed coach) as the new Head coach. They just managed though to avoid relegation at the end of the [[I-League 2010-11]] season.\n\n==A new era, new sponsors, and a new name (2011-present)==\n\nIn June 2011 Chirag Computers bought the financially troubled Viva Kerala FC. They took over a 60% stake in the club while original owners retained a 40% stake. They also changed the name of the club to Chirag United Club Kerala.
