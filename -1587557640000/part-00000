It is small bird, around {{cvt|12|cm}} long and weighing {{cvt|12|g}}, with a black crown and nape, pale cheeks, brown back and greyish-brown wings and tail. Between 8 and 11 subspecies are recognised. Its close resemblance to the willow tit can cause identification problems, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] where the local [[subspecies]] of the two are very similar: they were not recognised as separate species until 1897.\n\nGlobally, the marsh tit is classified as [[Least Concern]], although there is evidence of a decline in numbers (in the UK, numbers have dropped by more than 50% since the 1970s, for example). It can be found throughout temperate [[Europe]] and northern [[Asia]] and, despite its name, it occurs in a range of habitats including dry woodland. The marsh tit is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]; its food includes [[caterpillar]]s, [[spider]]s and seeds. It nests in tree holes, choosing existing hollows to enlarge, rather than excavating its own. A clutch of 5\u20139 eggs is laid.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics ==\nThe marsh tit was [[Species description|formally described]] by the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' under the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Parus palustris''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carl | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | year=1758 | title= Systema Naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis | volume=Volume 1| edition=10th | page=190 | publisher=Holmiae:Laurentii Salvii  | language=Latin | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/727099 }}</ref> It is now placed in the [[genus]] ''[[Poecile]]'' that was erected by the German naturalist [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] in 1829.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Kaup  | first=Johann Jakob  | author-link=Johann Jakob Kaup | year=1829 | title=Skizzirte Entwickelungs-Geschichte und nat\u00fcrliches System der europ\u00e4ischen Thierwelt | language=German | place=Darmstadt  | publisher=Carl Wilhelm Leske | page=114 | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41576537 }}</ref> The genus name, ''Poecile'', is the [[Ancient Greek]] name for a now unidentifiable small bird, and is perhaps derived from ''poikolos'', meaning \"spotted\"; the specific ''palustris'' is [[Latin]] for \"marshy\".<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n290 290], 311}}</ref><ref name=\"bto\"/>\n\nAn analysis of [[mtDNA|mitochrondrial DNA]] sequences has shown that the marsh tit belongs to a group of [[Eurasia]]n 'typical chickadees' that includes the [[willow tit]], [[P\u00e8re David's tit]], the [[black-bibbed tit]], and the [[Songar tit]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=F.

However, marsh tits seem not to perform the occasional [[irruption]]s that other members of the tit family do. Most marsh tits stay in their breeding territories year-round; presumably this is related to their food-storing strategy.

Its performances in the bushes and branches are just as neat and agile as those of other tits; it often hangs upside down by one leg.\n\n===Breeding===\nMarsh tits are monogamous and often pair for life; one pair stayed together for six years. In Europe, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] with the willow tit has been recorded twice.<ref name=\"bwpi\"/>\n\nThe nest site is in a hole, usually in a tree but sometimes in a wall or in the ground. [[Nestbox]]es may be used.<ref name=\"migatlas\"/> Old [[willow tit]] holes may be used and enlarged further. Marsh tits do not usually excavate their own nest holes, though they may enlarge the hollow, carrying the chips to a distance before dropping them. The hole may be within a centimetres or two of the ground or high as {{cvt|10|m}}. Inside the hole, a nest of moss is made and lined with hair and sometimes a few feathers; {{cvt|20|cm}} of moss is used in damp holes, but much less in dry ones.<ref name=\"bwpi\"/>\n[[File:Poecile palustris MWNH 1422.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\n\nBetween five and nine white and red-speckled [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s are laid late in April or in May, measuring {{cvt|16|x|12|mm}} and weighing {{cvt|1.2|g}} each, of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female for 14\u201316 days; incubation begins before the clutch is complete, meaning that the chicks hatch over a period of around two days. She sits closely and gives a typical tit \"hissing display\" if disturbed. The male helps to feed and care for the young and brings nearly all the food for the first four days after hatching. The [[altricial]], downy chicks [[fledge]] after 18\u201321 days.<ref name=\"bto\"/> The fledglings are fed by their parents for a week and become independent after a further 1\u20137 days.

[[Beechmast]] is the preferred food when it can be found. Marsh tits often take seeds and fruit from the plant before taking them to eat elsewhere.\n\nMarsh tits collect and store large numbers of seeds. For a study in [[Norway]], birds were watched for two hours 15 minutes. They ate 43 and cached 83 seeds per hour. In [[Sweden]], storing food is most frequent between September and late February, with the peak in this behaviour occurring from September to October. Hiding places for the seeds include on and in the ground, in leaf litter, in tree stumps, and under moss and [[lichen]] in trees.

It is small bird, around {{cvt|12|cm}} long and weighing {{cvt|12|g}}, with a black crown and nape, pale cheeks, brown back and greyish-brown wings and tail. Between 8 and 11 subspecies are recognised. Its close resemblance to the willow tit can cause identification problems, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] where the local [[subspecies]] of the two are very similar: they were not recognised as separate species until 1897.\n\nGlobally, the marsh tit is classified as [[Least Concern]], although there is evidence of a decline in numbers (in the UK, numbers have dropped by more than 50% since the 1970s, for example). It can be found throughout temperate [[Europe]] and northern [[Asia]] and, despite its name, it occurs in a range of habitats including dry woodland. The marsh tit is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]]; its food includes [[caterpillar]]s, [[spider]]s and seeds. It nests in tree holes, choosing existing hollows to enlarge, rather than excavating its own. A clutch of 5\u20139 eggs is laid.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics ==\nThe marsh tit was [[Species description|formally described]] by the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' under the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Parus palustris''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carl | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | year=1758 | title= Systema Naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis | volume=Volume 1| edition=10th | page=190 | publisher=Holmiae:Laurentii Salvii  | language=Latin | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/727099 }}</ref> It is now placed in the [[genus]] ''[[Poecile]]'' that was erected by the German naturalist [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] in 1829.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Kaup  | first=Johann Jakob  | author-link=Johann Jakob Kaup | year=1829 | title=Skizzirte Entwickelungs-Geschichte und nat\u00fcrliches System der europ\u00e4ischen Thierwelt | language=German | place=Darmstadt  | publisher=Carl Wilhelm Leske | page=114 | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41576537 }}</ref> The genus name, ''Poecile'', is the [[Ancient Greek]] name for a now unidentifiable small bird, and is perhaps derived from ''poikolos'', meaning \"spotted\"; the specific ''palustris'' is [[Latin]] for \"marshy\".<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n290 290], 311}}</ref><ref name=\"bto\"/>\n\nAn analysis of [[mtDNA|mitochrondrial DNA]] sequences has shown that the marsh tit belongs to a group of [[Eurasia]]n 'typical chickadees' that includes the [[willow tit]], [[P\u00e8re David's tit]], the [[black-bibbed tit]], and the [[Songar tit]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gill |first1=F.

Its performances in the bushes and branches are just as neat and agile as those of other tits; it often hangs upside down by one leg.\n\n===Breeding===\nMarsh tits are monogamous and often pair for life; one pair stayed together for six years. In Europe, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] with the willow tit has been recorded twice.<ref name=\"bwpi\"/>\n\nThe nest site is in a hole, usually in a tree but sometimes in a wall or in the ground. [[Nestbox]]es may be used.<ref name=\"migatlas\"/> Old [[willow tit]] holes may be used and enlarged further. Marsh tits do not usually excavate their own nest holes, though they may enlarge the hollow, carrying the chips to a distance before dropping them. The hole may be within a centimetres or two of the ground or high as {{cvt|10|m}}. Inside the hole, a nest of moss is made and lined with hair and sometimes a few feathers; {{cvt|20|cm}} of moss is used in damp holes, but much less in dry ones.<ref name=\"bwpi\"/>\n[[File:Poecile palustris MWNH 1422.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]\n\nBetween five and nine white and red-speckled [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s are laid late in April or in May, measuring {{cvt|16|x|12|mm}} and weighing {{cvt|1.2|g}} each, of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female for 14\u201316 days; incubation begins before the clutch is complete, meaning that the chicks hatch over a period of around two days. She sits closely and gives a typical tit \"hissing display\" if disturbed. The male helps to feed and care for the young and brings nearly all the food for the first four days after hatching.

Marsh tits often take seeds and fruit from the plant before taking them to eat elsewhere.\n\nMarsh tits collect and store large numbers of seeds. For a study in [[Norway]], birds were watched for two hours 15 minutes. They ate 43 and cached 83 seeds per hour. In [[Sweden]], storing food is most frequent between September and late February, with the peak in this behaviour occurring from September to October. Hiding places for the seeds include on and in the ground, in leaf litter, in tree stumps, and under moss and [[lichen]] in trees.
