British commercial interests in Bengal required safeguards. The [[United States government]] was also briefed on the possibility of three countries emerging out of partition, including Pakistan, India, and Bengal. On 2 June 1947, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] [[Lewis Williams Douglas]] that there was a \"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1453994/uk-pm-attlee-believed-bengal-may-opt-to-be-a-separate-country |title=UK PM Attlee believed Bengal may opt to be a separate country - Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> Douglas cabled the [[US State Department]] about the meeting.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOn 3 June 1947, [[Viceroy of India]] [[Earl Mountbatten]] outlined the framewrk principles of partition, including that in principle the partition of British India was accepted by the British Government; successor governments would be given [[dominion]] status; autonomy and sovereignty will be given to the new countries; each country will make its own constitution; [[princely states]] were given the right to either join Pakistan or India; and that [[British India|Provinces]] can become a separate nation other than Pakistan or India. There appeared to be some popular momentum towards the concept of United Bengal. On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] was held. Voters in the Sylhet division in Assam Province voted by a majority to bifurcate Sylhet from Assam and merge into Bengal.\n\nOn 20 June 1947, the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]] met to vote on the partition of Bengal. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]]. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

The seats set aside for Hindus and Scheduled Caste Hindus would be distributed amongst them in proportion to their respective population, or in such manner as may be agreed among them. The constituencies would be multiple constituencies and the votes would be distributive and not cumulative. A candidate who got the majority of the votes of his own community cast during the elections and 25 percent of the votes of the other communities so cast, would be declared elected. If no candidate satisfied these conditions, that candidate who got the largest number of votes of his own community would be elected.<ref name=\":1\" />\n#On the announcement by [[UK Government|His Majesty's Government]] that the proposal of the Free State of Bengal had been accepted and that Bengal would not be partitioned, the present Bengal Ministry would be dissolved. A new interim Ministry would be brought into being, consisting of an equal number of Muslims and Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) but excluding the Prime Minister. In this Ministry, the Prime Minister would be a Muslim and the Home Minister a Hindu.\n#Pending the final emergence of a Legislature and a Ministry under the new constitutions, Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) and Muslims would have an equal share in the Services, including military and police. The Services would be manned by Bengalis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n#A Constituent Assembly composed of 30 persons, 16 Muslims and 14 non-Muslims, would be elected by Muslim and non-Muslim members of the Legislature respectively, excluding Europeans.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe United Bengal proposal remains the sole attempt to establish a modern state encompassing East and West Bengal. However, since the Partition of Bengal in 1947, the region's politics have veered away from any semblance of pan-Bengali nationalism. It also became complicated with [[India]]n support for [[East Pakistan]]'s liberation as [[Bangladesh]] in 1971. Given the close [[Bangladesh-India relations]], any notion of a pan-Bengali state is considered unrealistic. The pioneer of the United Bengal proposal, Suhrawardy, went on to become a leading statesman of [[Pakistan]]. Suhrawardy died in [[Beirut]] in 1963 in a country with a confessionalist system.  In his memoirs, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the founder of Bangladesh and a protege of Suhrawardy, remarked \"The Bengalis has initially failed to appreciate a leader of Mr. Suhrawardy\u2019s stature.

A minority of leaders in the Bengal League favored partition and the inclusion of eastern Bengal and Assam in Pakistan. These leaders included former premier Sir [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]].<ref name=\"banglapedia1\" />\n\nWithin the [[British government]], there was serious consideration of the proposal. British commercial interests in Bengal required safeguards. The [[United States government]] was also briefed on the possibility of three countries emerging out of partition, including Pakistan, India, and Bengal. On 2 June 1947, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] [[Lewis Williams Douglas]] that there was a \"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1453994/uk-pm-attlee-believed-bengal-may-opt-to-be-a-separate-country |title=UK PM Attlee believed Bengal may opt to be a separate country - Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> Douglas cabled the [[US State Department]] about the meeting.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOn 3 June 1947, [[Viceroy of India]] [[Earl Mountbatten]] outlined the framework principles of partition, including that in principle the partition of British India was accepted by the British Government; successor governments would be given [[dominion]] status; autonomy and sovereignty will be given to the new countries; each country will make its own constitution; [[princely states]] were given the right to either join Pakistan or India; and that [[British India|Provinces]] can become a separate nation other than Pakistan or India. There appeared to be some popular momentum towards the concept of United Bengal. On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] was held. Voters in the Sylhet division in Assam Province voted by a majority to bifurcate Sylhet from Assam and merge into Bengal.\n\nOn 20 June 1947, the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]] met to vote on the partition of Bengal. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]]. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

Its salient features are outlined below.\n\n#Bengal would be a Free State. The Free State of Bengal would decide its relations with the rest of India.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Misra|first1=Chitta Ranjan|title=United Bengal Movement|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=United_Independent_Bengal_Movement|website=Banglapedia|publisher=Bangladesh Asiatic Society|accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref>\n#The Constitution of the Free State of Bengal would provide for election to the Bengal Legislature on the basis of a joint electorate and adult franchise, with reservation of seats proportionate to the population among Hindus and Muslims. The seats set aside for Hindus and Scheduled Caste Hindus would be distributed amongst them in proportion to their respective population, or in such manner as may be agreed among them. The constituencies would be multiple constituencies and the votes would be distributive and not cumulative. A candidate who got the majority of the votes of his own community cast during the elections and 25 percent of the votes of the other communities so cast, would be declared elected. If no candidate satisfied these conditions, that candidate who got the largest number of votes of his own community would be elected.<ref name=\":1\" />\n#On the announcement by [[UK Government|His Majesty's Government]] that the proposal of the Free State of Bengal had been accepted and that Bengal would not be partitioned, the present Bengal Ministry would be dissolved. A new interim Ministry would be brought into being, consisting of an equal number of Muslims and Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) but excluding the Prime Minister. In this Ministry, the Prime Minister would be a Muslim and the Home Minister a Hindu.\n#Pending the final emergence of a Legislature and a Ministry under the new constitutions, Hindus (including Scheduled Caste Hindus) and Muslims would have an equal share in the Services, including military and police. The Services would be manned by Bengalis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n#A Constituent Assembly composed of 30 persons, 16 Muslims and 14 non-Muslims, would be elected by Muslim and non-Muslim members of the Legislature respectively, excluding Europeans.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe United Bengal proposal remains the sole attempt to establish a modern state encompassing East and West Bengal. However, since the Partition of Bengal in 1947, the region's politics have veered away from any semblance of pan-Bengali nationalism. It also became complicated with [[India]]n support for [[East Pakistan]]'s liberation as [[Bangladesh]] in 1971. Given the close [[Bangladesh-India relations]], any notion of a pan-Bengali state is considered unrealistic. The pioneer of the United Bengal proposal, Suhrawardy, went on to become a leading statesman of [[Pakistan]]. Suhrawardy died in [[Beirut]] in 1963 in a country with a confessionalist system.  In his memoirs, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the founder of Bangladesh and a protege of Suhrawardy, remarked \"The Bengalis has initially failed to appreciate a leader of Mr. Suhrawardy\u2019s stature.
