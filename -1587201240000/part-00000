REAC were promoted to the [[Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g|Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I.]], the first division in Hungarian football, after the 2005/06 season, but the team was relegated to the [[Hungarian National Championship II]] after the [[Hungarian National Championship I 2008\u201309|2008/09]] season. The football team plays its home matches at [[Stadion Budai II. Laszl\u00f3|Laszl\u00f3 Budai II Stadium]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1912 to 1991: Founding to the end of Vol\u00e1n===\nA team named REAC was founded in the Budapest neighborhood R\u00e1kospalota in 1912, but operations ended in the 1940s. Football continued, however, in the neighborhood with the best known teams being ''F\u0151sped Sz\u00e1ll\u00edt\u00f3k'' and ''[[Vol\u00e1n]]'', the latter of which entered the NB I. in 1979. Until 1991, when the club came to an end, Vol\u00e1n had enjoyed six seasons in the top flight, although they never finished higher than 11th and often finished at the very bottom of the table. What remained of the club merged with ''RAK'' and on August 8 resurrected the name REAC. Since Vol\u00e1n officially ended prior to the merger the newly reformed REAC didn't take any of its records, nor was it allowed to continue in the NB I. Instead they began play in the BLSZ I.\n\n===1992: The fight for the second division===\nBy 1992 they had dropped to the NB III M\u00e1tra group, and though the goal was clearly to return to the second division they had a tough path to work through, including Monor and former NB I. team Szolnok M\u00c1V. As winter came and the first half of the season came to a close, REAC was in third place, but only a point separated them and Dunakeszi VSE for second. They would finish that spring not only with 41 points, exactly one point ahead of second place Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s, but with the right to play in the NB II. that coming fall.\n\n===1993: The first year in NB II===\nThe team was placed in the Eastern division of NB II., which was clearly the more difficult at the time\u2014former NB I. teams [[Di\u00f3sgy\u0151ri VTK|Di\u00f3sgy\u0151r]] and [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za Spartacus]] were also in the division, as well as several other strong clubs. The team, however, knew it would be more important to defeat the weaker teams in the division\u2014Eger, Szeged, for instance\u2014if it was even going to think about competing with the better teams. Under the guidance of their coach and former Fradi player and J\u00f3zsef D\u00e1lnoki, they won their first match 1\u20130 against G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151. The good start was short lived, however, and over the next five matches they would only gain one point in the standings. A 3\u20130 win over Eger brought hope, but over the next eight matches they didn't notch a single win and only three ties. The team fired D\u00e1lnoki, and hired former Hungarian national team player Imre Garaba, who would have to wait five matches before the team's next victory. They ended the season in last place, and prepared to return to NB III.\n\n===1994\u20131995: Back in NB III===\nRelegation hurt the team as many players left (several eventually ended up in NB I) as did Garaba, who left for G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151. He was replaced by P\u00e9ter Antal, a former [[Vasas SC|Vasas]] player. They began the 1994\u20131995 season with two scoreless losses and by the halfway point of the season they were in sixth place. But the team didn't give up hope, winning ten and drawing twice in their next 12 matches and with three matches left the team was in second place. Though they won one against Eger, the team ultimately ended the season in 3rd place.\n\nThe team started the 1995\u20131996 optimistic and with a stronger team than most of the competition. Aside from a surprise home loss against Selypi Kinizsi the team did just that and they ended the first half of the season tied for first with Szolnok M\u00c1V. In a decisive match in the second half of the season, REAC lost to Szolnok and ultimately lost the championship, though they led the league in goals scored with 66.\n\n===1996\u20131998: Return to the second division===\nREAC came back for their third season in the NB III M\u00e1tra group with a new coach; the former ''Vol\u00e1n'' defender B\u00e9la Heged\u0171s. Though they began the season with four wins, two losses followed, and Heged\u0171s stepped down, being replaced by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kiss. Though they played strong throughout the season, they ended the season in 2nd place.\n\nIn 1997 the league restructured, and though REAC finished second, they began the 1997\u20131998 season in the NB II Eastern Group. Their goal was clear from that point; remaining in the second division. Though the club struggled, they finished the year in 8th place and prepared for their second straight season in the NB II.\n\nThe team had high hopes coming into 1998. Former coach Kiss returned to the team along with most of the team's key players. Though they started out strong, they completely fell apart and by the season's halfway point they found themselves in 10th place. Their woes continued in the second half of the season, where they only gained four points in the next seven matches. They were able to end things on a winning note, though they still finished the season in tenth place.\n\n===2005\u2013present: NB I and relegation===\n2005\u20132006, the team's first season in the top division was full of hardship, and the team finished in 14th place, just barely outside of the relegation zone. The story was similar in 2006\u20132007, with only one match left in the season they were among three teams statistically in danger of relegation. They finished the season with a 2\u20132 draw against [[Videoton FC Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], but since [[P\u00e9csi Mecsek FC|P\u00e9cs]] were unable to beat [[Dunakanyar-V\u00e1c FC|V\u00e1c]] REAC were safe from relegation once again and were allowed to compete in the NB I. for a third straight season. This was made official on May 24, 2007, when the team was among five Hungarian clubs who had their professional licenses renewed by MLSZ. In the 2008/09 season the team could not escape relegation, and went down to the second division for the next season. In 2012, the team was relegated to the third division, NBIII. In 2017, the team was relegated to the fourth division, that is, the Budapest first division championship.\n\n===Suicide of chairman R\u00f3bert Kutasi===\n\nIt was reported on 2 March 2012 that the chairman of the club, R\u00f3bert Kutasi, had committed suicide at the age of 48<ref>[http://www.nemzetisport.hu/labdarugo_nb_ii/gyasz-ongyilkos-lett-kutasi-robert-a-reac-igazgatoja-2119849 (Hungarian)]</ref>\n\n== Results (1991\u2013present) ==\n{| \n | '''Year'''\n | '''Championship'''\n | '''Rank'''\n |-\n |1991\u20131992\n |[[NB II]]\n |15.\n |-\n |1992\u20131993\n |[[NB III]]\n |1.\n |-\n |1993\u20131994\n |[[NB II]]\n |16.\n |-\n |1994\u20131995\n |[[NB III]]\n |3.\n |-\n |1995\u20131996\n |[[NB III]]\n |2.\n |-\n |1996\u20131997\n |[[NB III]]\n |2.\n |-\n |1997\u20131998\n |[[NB II]]\n |8.\n |-\n |1998\u20131999\n |[[NB II]]\n |10.\n |-\n |1999\u20131900\n |[[NB II / NB I]]\n |16.\n |-\n |2000\u20132001\n |[[NB II]]\n |10.\n |-\n |2001\u20132002\n |[[NB II]]\n |5.\n |-\n |2002\u20132003\n |[[NB II]]\n |?\n |-\n |2003\u20132004\n |[[NB II]]\n |6.\n |-\n |2004\u20132005\n |[[NB II]]\n |2.\n |-\n |2005\u20132006\n |[[NB I]]\n |14.\n |-\n |2006\u20132007\n |[[NB I]]\n |14.\n |-\n |2007\u20132008\n |[[NB I]]\n |12.\n |-\n |2008\u20132009\n |[[NB I]]\n |16.\n |-\n |2009\u20132010\n |[[NB II]]\n |4.\n |-\n |2010\u20132011\n |[[NB II]]\n |10.\n |-\n |2011\u20132012\n |[[NB II]]\n |15.\n |-\n |2012\u20132013\n |[[NB III]]\n |3.\n |-\n |2013\u20132014\n |[[NB III]]\n |12.\n |-\n |2014\u20132015\n |[[NB III]]\n |3.\n |-\n |2015\u20132016\n |[[NB III]]\n |16.\n |-\n |2016\u20132017\n |[[NB III]]\n |15.\n |-\n |}\n\n== Squad in 2011 ==\n''As of 6 September 2011\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=Bal\u00e1zs Dinka}} (c)\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=M\u00e1t\u00e9 Guly\u00e1s}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=Gerg\u0151 Cseri}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=Hungary|pos=FW|name=[[Zsolt Szab\u00f3 (footballer)|Zsolt Szab\u00f3]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=Hungary|pos=FW|name=Kriszti\u00e1n Nyerges}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=Hungary|pos=GK|name=Zolt\u00e1n T\u00f3th}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=D\u00e1niel Ferencz}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=Bal\u00e1zs Kov\u00e1cs}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=Hungary|pos=GK|name=Gell\u00e9rt Vajda}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=[[K\u00e1roly Kiss]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=Bal\u00e1zs G\u00e1sp\u00e1r}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3vizi}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=Attila Menyh\u00e1rt}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=Hungary|pos=FW|name=Zolt\u00e1n Jov\u00e1nczai}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=[[Attila Kornis]]|other= on loan from [[MTK Budapest]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=[[M\u00e1rk\u00f3 S\u00f3s]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=Hungary|pos=FW|name=[[P\u00e9ter T\u00f3th (footballer, born 1989)|P\u00e9ter T\u00f3th]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=Gerg\u0151 Menyh\u00e9rt}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=Hungary|pos=DF|name=K\u00e1roly Ill\u00e9s}}\n{{Fs player|no=33|nat=Hungary|pos=MF|name=[[Zolt\u00e1n B\u00f6\u0151r]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n<!-- This section is for current squad only.

REAC were promoted to the [[Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g|Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I.]], the first division in Hungarian football, after the 2005/06 season, but the team was relegated to the [[Hungarian National Championship II]] after the [[Hungarian National Championship I 2008\u201309|2008/09]] season. The football team plays its home matches at [[Stadion Budai II. Laszl\u00f3|Laszl\u00f3 Budai II Stadium]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1912 to 1991: Founding to the end of Vol\u00e1n===\nA team named REAC was founded in the Budapest neighborhood R\u00e1kospalota in 1912, but operations ended in the 1940s. Football continued, however, in the neighborhood with the best known teams being ''F\u0151sped Sz\u00e1ll\u00edt\u00f3k'' and ''[[Vol\u00e1n]]'', the latter of which entered the NB I. in 1979. Until 1991, when the club came to an end, Vol\u00e1n had enjoyed six seasons in the top flight, although they never finished higher than 11th and often finished at the very bottom of the table. What remained of the club merged with ''RAK'' and on August 8 resurrected the name REAC. Since Vol\u00e1n officially ended prior to the merger the newly reformed REAC didn't take any of its records, nor was it allowed to continue in the NB I. Instead they began play in the BLSZ I.\n\n===1992: The fight for the second division===\nBy 1992 they had dropped to the NB III M\u00e1tra group, and though the goal was clearly to return to the second division they had a tough path to work through, including Monor and former NB I. team Szolnok M\u00c1V. As winter came and the first half of the season came to a close, REAC was in third place, but only a point separated them and Dunakeszi VSE for second. They would finish that spring not only with 41 points, exactly one point ahead of second place Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s, but with the right to play in the NB II. that coming fall.\n\n===1993: The first year in NB II===\nThe team was placed in the Eastern division of NB II., which was clearly the more difficult at the time\u2014former NB I. teams [[Di\u00f3sgy\u0151ri VTK|Di\u00f3sgy\u0151r]] and [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za Spartacus]] were also in the division, as well as several other strong clubs. The team, however, knew it would be more important to defeat the weaker teams in the division\u2014Eger, Szeged, for instance\u2014if it was even going to think about competing with the better teams. Under the guidance of their coach and former Fradi player and J\u00f3zsef D\u00e1lnoki, they won their first match 1\u20130 against G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151. The good start was short lived, however, and over the next five matches they would only gain one point in the standings. A 3\u20130 win over Eger brought hope, but over the next eight matches they didn't notch a single win and only three ties. The team fired D\u00e1lnoki, and hired former Hungarian national team player Imre Garaba, who would have to wait five matches before the team's next victory. They ended the season in last place, and prepared to return to NB III.\n\n===1994\u20131995: Back in NB III===\nRelegation hurt the team as many players left (several eventually ended up in NB I) as did Garaba, who left for G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151. He was replaced by P\u00e9ter Antal, a former [[Vasas SC|Vasas]] player. They began the 1994\u20131995 season with two scoreless losses and by the halfway point of the season they were in sixth place. But the team didn't give up hope, winning ten and drawing twice in their next 12 matches and with three matches left the team was in second place. Though they won one against Eger, the team ultimately ended the season in 3rd place.\n\nThe team started the 1995\u20131996 optimistic and with a stronger team than most of the competition. Aside from a surprise home loss against Selypi Kinizsi the team did just that and they ended the first half of the season tied for first with Szolnok M\u00c1V. In a decisive match in the second half of the season, REAC lost to Szolnok and ultimately lost the championship, though they led the league in goals scored with 66.\n\n===1996\u20131998: Return to the second division===\nREAC came back for their third season in the NB III M\u00e1tra group with a new coach; the former ''Vol\u00e1n'' defender B\u00e9la Heged\u0171s. Though they began the season with four wins, two losses followed, and Heged\u0171s stepped down, being replaced by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kiss. Though they played strong throughout the season, they ended the season in 2nd place.\n\nIn 1997 the league restructured, and though REAC finished second, they began the 1997\u20131998 season in the NB II Eastern Group. Their goal was clear from that point; remaining in the second division. Though the club struggled, they finished the year in 8th place and prepared for their second straight season in the NB II.\n\nThe team had high hopes coming into 1998. Former coach Kiss returned to the team along with most of the teams key players. Though they started out strong, they completely fell apart and by the season's halfway point they found themselves in 10th place. Their woes continued in the second half of the season, where they only gained four points in the next seven matches. They were able to end things on a winning note, though they still finished the season in tenth place.\n\n===2005\u2013present: NB I and relegation===\n2005\u20132006, the team's first season in the top division was full of hardship, and the team finished in 14th place, just barely outside of the relegation zone.

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

Introduced in 1960, the [[Fender Jazz Bass]], initially known as the \"Deluxe Bass\", was intended to accompany the [[Jazzmaster]] guitar.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The \"J-bass\" featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass's split coil pickup position. The earliest production Jazz basses had a \"stacked\"{{explain|date=February 2019}} volume and tone control for each pickup; this was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single passive tone control. \n\nThe Jazz Bass's neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass \u2014 {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm|0}} versus {{convert|1+3/4|in|mm|0}} \u2014 allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar, allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Another visual difference that set the Jazz Bass apart from the Precision is its \"offset-waist\" body.{{explain|date=February 2019}}\n\nPickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as \"P\" or \"J\" pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In the 1950s and 1960s, all bass guitars were often called the \"Fender bass\", due to [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]'s early dominance in the market.\n\nProviding a more \"Gibson-scale\" instrument, rather than the {{convert|34|in|mm|0}} Jazz and Precision, Fender produced the [[Fender Mustang Bass|Mustang Bass]], a {{convert|30|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale-length instrument.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The [[Fender VI]], a 6 string bass, was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning.

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].

Over the next four decades, the Equitable and its imitators sold approximately 9 million policies \u2013 two-thirds of the nation's outstanding insurance contracts. During the [[Panic of 1873]] many life insurance companies went out of business as deteriorating financial conditions created solvency problems: those that survived had all offered tontines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Tony |date=2009 |page=5 |title=The Performance of Life Insurance Companies: 1860\u20131905 |url=http://www.americasmutualbanks.com/images/0714_YangPaper.pdf }}</ref> However, the contracts included an obligation to maintain monthly payments, and as a result spawned large numbers of policy owners whose life savings were wiped out by a single missed payment.

The plot revolves around a tontine originally taken out for some wealthy English children, and the resulting shenanigans as younger family members of the two final survivors vie to secure the final payout. The book was adapted as a [[The Wrong Box|film]], produced and directed by [[Bryan Forbes]], (1966).\n*''The Secret Tontine'' (1912), is an atmospheric faux-gothic novel by [[Robert Murray Gilchrist]], set in the [[Derbyshire]] [[Peak District]] during a snowy winter in the late 19th century. The plot involves the potential beneficiaries of a covert tontine, and their scheme to murder their ignorant rivals. \n*[[Lillian de la Torre]]'s short story \"The Tontine Curse\" (1948) features mysterious deaths related to a tontine in 1779, being investigated by [[Samuel Johnson]].\n*''The Tontine'' (1955), a novel by [[Thomas B. Costain]], illustrated by [[Herbert Ryman]], is set in nineteenth-century England and tells a story centered around the fictional \"Waterloo Tontine\", established to benefit veterans of the Napoleonic wars. Among other plot twists, shareholders hire an actor to impersonate a dead nominee, and conspire to murder another member.\n*In ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957), a [[Miss Marple]] murder mystery by [[Agatha Christie]], the plot revolves around the will of a wealthy industrialist, which establishes a [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] under which his estate is divided in trust among his grandchildren, the final survivor to inherit the whole. The settlement is described, inaccurately, as a tontine. \n*''[[Something Fishy]]'' (1957), a novel by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], features a so-called tontine under which the investors' sons stand to gain from marrying late.\n* In the U.S. television series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', Episode 16 of Season Two (1966\u201367) \u2013 \"The Night of the Tottering Tontine\" \u2013 finds James West and Artemus Gordon protecting a man who is a member of a tontine whose members are being murdered one by another.\n*\"Old Soldiers,\" an eighth-season episode of the television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', focuses on a tontine set up among Colonel Potter and several of his Army buddies from [[World War I]]. While taking shelter in a ch\u00e2teau during an artillery barrage, they had found a cache of brandy and drank all but one bottle, which they set aside for the last survivor.

Grampa eventually kicks Burns out of the tontine for trying to kill him, but before he and Bart can do anything with the art, a descendant of the original owner shows up to claim it.\n*In [[S. L. Viehl]]'s science fiction multi-volume novel ''Stardoc'' (2000), the title character is accused of spreading a plague to several colony worlds, on one of which the colonists had established a tontine. The sole survivor, a little girl, consequently becomes so wealthy that in the second book of the series \u2013 ''Beyond Varallan'' (2000) \u2013 she buys the bank behind the colonies to free the Stardoc from the debt she now owes.\n*The 2001 comedy film ''[[Tomcats (2001 film)|Tomcats]]'' features a variation on a tontine where the last investor to get married gets the full amount of the invested funds.\n* In the ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' episode \"The Double Deuce\" (2011), Archer's [[valet]] Woodhouse is revealed as one of three final survivors of a group of World War I [[Royal Flying Corps]] squadron mates who each put [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 into an interest-bearing account, now worth nearly a million [[United States dollar|dollars]]. The office workers at ISIS HQ, realizing that a new tontine could capitalize on the high mortality rate of field agents, begin persuading people to join.\n* The ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' episode \"Being of Sound Mind\" (Season 8 Episode 16) features a tontine as a motive for murder.\n*The ''[[The Brokenwood Mysteries|Brokenwood Mysteries]]'' episode \"Tontine\" (Season 5 Episode 3) centres on a tontine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Buley|first=R.

It enables subscribers to share the risk of living a long life by combining features of a group [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] with a kind of mortality [[lottery]]. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodical payout. As members die, their payout entitlements devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each continuing payout increases.

The French finally established a state tontine in 1689<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> (though it was not described by that name because Tonti had died in disgrace, about five years earlier). The English government organised a tontine in 1693.<ref name=\"Milevsky\">Milevsky 2015.</ref> Nine further government tontines were organised in France down to 1759; four more in Britain down to 1789; and others in the Netherlands and some of the German states. Those in Britain were not fully subscribed, and in general the British schemes tended to be less popular and successful than their continental counterparts.<ref>Weir 1989, pp. 95\u2013124</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the tontine had fallen out of favour as a revenue-raising instrument with governments, but smaller-scale and less formal tontines continued to be arranged between individuals or to raise funds for specific projects throughout the 19th century, and, in modified form, to the present day.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n==Concept==\nEach investor pays a sum into the tontine. Each investor then receives annual [[interest]] on the [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. As each investor dies, his or her share is reallocated among the surviving investors. This process continues until the death of the final investor, when the scheme is wound up. Each subscriber receives only interest; the capital is never paid back.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\">Weir 1989, pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nStrictly speaking, the transaction involves four different roles:<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\n# the government or corporate body which organizes the scheme, receives the loans and manages the capital\n# the subscribers who provide the capital\n# the shareholders who receive the annual interest\n# the nominees on whose lives the contracts are contingent\n\nIn most 18th- and 19th-century schemes, parties 2 to 4 were the same individuals; but in a significant minority of schemes each initial subscriber-shareholder was permitted to invest in the name of another party (generally one of his or her own children), who would inherit that share on the subscriber's death.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nBecause younger nominees clearly had a longer life expectancy, the 17th- and 18th-century tontines were normally divided into several \"classes\" by age (typically in bands of 5, 7 or 10 years): each class effectively formed a separate tontine, with the shares of deceased members devolving to fellow-nominees within the same class.<ref name=\"Weir103-4\"/>\n\nIn a later variation, the capital devolves upon the last survivor, thus dissolving the trust and potentially making the survivor very wealthy.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}} This version has often provided the plot device for mysteries and detective stories.\n\n==Patent==\n[[File:Dousset 1792.png|thumb|right|First page of Dousset 1792 French patent for a tontine]][[Business method patent|Financial inventions were patentable]] under French law from January 1791 until September 1792.

The initial subscribers each put in 300 [[French livre|livres]] and, unlike most later schemes, this one was run honestly; the last survivor, a widow named Charlotte Barbier, who died in 1726 at the age of 96, received 73,000 livres in her last payment.<ref>Coudy 1957</ref><ref>Jennings and Trout 1982.</ref><ref name=\"Weir89\">Weir 1989.</ref> The English government first issued tontines in 1693 to fund a war against France, part of the [[Nine Years' War]].<ref name=\"Milevsky\"/><ref name=\"Weir89\"/>\n\nTontines soon caused financial problems for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended to underestimate the [[longevity]] of the population. At first, tontine holders included men and women of all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to [[Gaming the system|game the system]], and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s tontines had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as \"[[penny policy|penny policies]]\", a predecessor of the 20th-century [[pension]] scheme.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}<!-- the previous paragraph mentions dishonestly-run tontines; there should be a discussion of those, too, and that phenomenon's role in the move to prohibit the tontine.-->\n\nA property development tontine, The Victoria Park Company, was at the heart of the notable case of ''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' in mid-19th-century [[England]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n==Projects funded by tontines==\n[[File:Tontine coffee house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Tontine Coffee House]] (at left) on [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]]]]\nTontines were often used to raise funds for private or [[public works]] projects.<ref>Green 2019.</ref> These sometimes contained the word \"tontine\" in their name.\n\nSome notable tontine-funded projects included:\n*[[Richmond Bridge, London|Richmond Bridge]], across the [[River Thames]] west of London, was financed using a tontine in 1774.\n*The Tontine Hotel in [[Ironbridge]], Shropshire, stands prominently at one end of the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] from which the town takes its name: it was built in 1780\u201384 by the proprietors of the bridge to accommodate tourists who came to view this wonder of the industrial age.\n*The [[Glasgow Cross|Tontine Hotel and Assembly Rooms]], [[Glasgow]], were funded through two tontine of 1781 and 1796.\n*The [[Tontine Coffee House]] on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]], built in 1792, was the first home of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n*The first [[Freemasons' Hall, London]].
