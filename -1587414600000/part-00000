After seven years as a principal baritone at Frankfurt Opera and [[Zurich Opera]], he returned to the U.S. and originated r\u00f4les at major houses such as the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], [[Dallas Opera]], [[San Diego Opera]], and [[Los Angeles Opera]].\n\nOn November 25, 1996, Gilfry made his debut with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] as Demetrius in the company's premiere of [[Benjamin Britten|Britten's]] ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', a role he sang eight times that season. He returned in the 2000-2001 season for six performances each as Marcello in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini's]] ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'' and as Guglielmo in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]''.\n\nGilfry went on to specialize in new music, introducing r\u00f4les in many new operas.

During August 2006 he portrayed Prospero in [[Thomas Ades]]' [[The Tempest]] with the [[Santa Fe Opera]], one of the few r\u00f4les in new opera that he did not originate. In November 2006 he created the role of Jack London in Libby Larsen's ''[[Every Man Jack]]'' for Sonoma City Opera. In 2008 he sang the principal role of Falke in a Japanese tour of ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and the title role in the Dutch/British production of [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s opera ''[[Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise]]''.

Here is a lusciously shaded lyric voice with real dramatic possibilities, with [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] full of rhythmic vitality and a stage presence many a non-musical actor might envy.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Sun-Shines-on-Gilfry-At-Opera-in-the-Park-2990953.php |title=Sun Shines on Gilfry At Opera in the Park |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Octavio Roca |date=14 September 1998}}</ref>\n\nHe has sung on 25 recordings including his 1995 ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' [[Compact disc|CD]] which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].\n\n== Crossover to musicals ==\n\nGilfry fell in love with musicals when he starred in his high school production of ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He has sung Curly in ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', Billy Bigelow in ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', and Joe in ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'', all in Los Angeles.

He has told interviewers that he hopes to do a run on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in a new musical or revival. In June 2009 he launched the [[Ravinia Festival]] season, starring as [[Lancelot]] opposite [[Sylvia McNair|Sylvia McNair's]][[Guinevere|Guenevere]] in a concert version of ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''.

He also made a [[DVD]] and enhanced CD of his cabaret show.\n\nOn Sunday 22 August 2010, he appeared at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London alongside [[Kim Criswell]] in a [[The Proms|BBC Prom]] celebrating the music of Rodgers & Hammerstein.  The concert was broadcast on the BBC on Saturday 28 August 2010.\n\nIn June, 2012 Gilfry garnered critical acclaim for his portrayal of Sweeney Todd in the [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] festival production of \"[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]] ,\" directed by Ron Daniels and conducted by [[Stephen Lord (conductor)|Stephen Lord]].\n\n== Personal ==\nMarried with three children, Gilfry makes his home in suburban [[Los Angeles]].

Band leader [[Bill Nelson]] formed the group after the disbandment of [[Be-Bop Deluxe]] in 1978. The record was recorded with producer and engineer [[John Leckie]], and marks a stylistic change for Nelson with its emphasis on [[synthesizer]]s. His lyrics were inspired by [[science fiction]] and [[dystopian]] themes, which the musician tried to present in a humorous way. The album cover, featuring a bed-ridden robot, was photographed by [[Bishin Jumonji]]\n\nPromoted by the singles \"Furniture Music\" and \"Revolt Into Style\", ''Sound-on-Sound'' reached number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and perplexed fans and music critics, with criticism centred on its 'artificial' sound. EMI, Harvest's parent label, dropped Nelson in July 1979, rendering ''Sound-on-Sound'' their only album. It has been re-released by Harvest several times, including as a deluxe edition in 2012, and has been reappraised in a positive light by critics.\n\n== Background and recording==\nSince their 1972 inception, Bill Nelson was the leader and guitarist of eclectic rock band [[Be-Bop Deluxe]], with whom he achieved some success,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=Be-Bop Deluxe Artist Biography by William Ruhlmann |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/be-bop-deluxe-mn0000127337/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> but later found himself restricted as the group's guitarist.<ref name=\"Robbins\">{{cite web |last1=Robbins |first1=Ira |title=Bill Nelson |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=bill_nelson |website=Trouser Press |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> With the band's final album, ''[[Drastic Plastic]]'' (1978), Nelson felt his ideas were marginalised compared to those of his bandmates, describing the record as disrupting the \"transitional stage\" he envisioned exploring between their previous album ''[[Modern Music (Be-Bop Deluxe album)|Modern Music]]'' (1976) and what became ''Sound-on-Sound''. As such, he dissolved Be-Bop Deluxe, feeling that beginning a new band was \"the only way to do what I wanted to do.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> He had wished to dissolve the group before ''Drastic Plastic'' was recorded, but was persuaded by the band's management to continue. \"Had I gotten my way,\" Nelson later said, \"the ''Drastic Plastic'' material would have been recorded as the first Red Noise album. Instead, I adapted it for the final Be Bop album.\"<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\n[[File:Minimoog.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Minimoog]] is one of the most-used synths on ''Sound-on-Sound''.]]\nBy forming Bill Nelson's Red Noise, the musician again exerted creative control, paying the other members as [[session musician]]s. He described the decision to form a band, rather than present himself as a solo musician with \"an anonymous backing group\", as a way of \"hiding\" and avoid being trapped \"in a specific mould\" if he achieved major success, saying: \"This way I can change whatever cover I have to work under when my ideas alter or develop.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Be-Bop Deluxe keyboardist [[Andy Clarke]] joined Nelson in Red Noise, with the line-up completed by Bill's brother [[Ian Nelson (musician)|Ian]] on saxophone and [[jazz]] bassist Rick Ford. Drumming on ''Sound-on-Sound'' is split between Nelson and [[Dave Mattacks]].<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> The group recorded the album at [[Townhouse Studios]], [[London]], with producer and engineer [[John Leckie]].<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Nelson had worked with Leckie since [[Axe Victim|the first Be-Bop Deluxe album]] and found their partnership had developed into a \"very give-and-take\" fashion.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\nRecording the album was simpler process than any Be-Bop Deluxe record due to the prevalence of synthesizers, which Nelson felt were \"much richer, [[tonality|tonally]], than you realise,\" and only used [[overdubbing|overdubs]] to emphasise a specific sound, typically guitars. He elaborated: \"With a synthesizer you press a switch and a sound is the direct result. With a guitar you pluck a string, which resonates above a [[pickup (music technology)|pick-up]], which then sends a signal along a wire to an amplifier, etc, etc, etc. It's a thinner sound altogether, which is why we can reproduce the album material so much more simply onstage using a lot of electronic instruments.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The influence of [[electronic music]] on Nelson in the period, including groups like the [[the Residents]], led him to begin using a [[synthesizer guitar]] instead of an ordinary one, and processing snare drums through [[fuzzbox]]es, among other experimentation.<ref name=\"Randall\">{{cite journal |last1=Randall |first1=Mac |title=Robert Wyatt & Bill Nelson: Tough Guys Don't Dance |journal=Musician |date=August 1992 |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/robert-wyatt--bill-nelson-tough-guys-dont-dance- |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> The most prominent synths on the album are the [[Minimoog]] and [[Yamaha CS80]].<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Several songs on the album were remixed at Utopia Studios, London.<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Upon completion, Nelson felt unusually proud of the album, whereas with Be-Bop Deluxe albums he \"couldn't bear to hear them for two months afterwards.\"<ref name=\"Mitchell\" />\n\n==Composition==\nNelson wrote the songs on ''Sound-on-Sound'' about \"mundane, domestic things,\" citing \"electronic appliances, factories...the paraphernalia of the times,\" and commenting that the album's instrumentation and arrangements reflect this.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> He said the \"basic concept\" behind the record was to explore all the [[science fiction]] themes he \"hinted at\" with Be-Bop Deluxe, who had one song on each album with such themes.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Jim |title=Bill Nelson: Triumph of the Bill |journal=Trouser Press |date=November 1981 |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/bill-nelson-triumph-of-the-bill |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> He drew inspiration from dystopian novels like [[E.M.

He married Jan by the recording of ''Sound-on-Sound'' and reflected on the song: \"I'd been trying to tell Jan how I felt about her through my songs. They were born out of this heady love I was feeling for her.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n== Release and reception ==\nThe sleeve of ''Sound-on-Sound'' was designed by Japanese artist [[Bishin Jumonji]],<ref name=\"Easlea\" /> and depicts a bed-ridden robot constructed of both electronic and [[electromechanic]]al components, chosen by Nelson to represent the album's 'mundane, domestic' themes.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The back cover features an \"Important Notice\" writing that the album was \"styled with today's [[hi-fi]] in mind,\" saying that the record should be \"played at high volume in a room with no views other than those affored by the use of subliminal image video apparatus.\"<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Nelson said he wrote the notice with his \"[[Tongue-in-cheek|tongue firmly in cheek]]\".<ref name=\"Nelson\" /> During the band's live performances, the group wore [[Red Army]]-style matching uniforms and used intricate lighting to \"underline the point of the music,\" according to Nelson, who elaborated: \"The songs are about the impending gloom of 1984, the austerity and the indoctrination. But I wanted to present the band as the perpetrators rather than the victims. The uniforms are part of that.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\nAfter disbanding Be-Bop Deluxe, Nelson gave [[EMI]] \u2013 parent company of [[Harvest Records]], whom the band were signed to \u2013 a choice between signing Red Noise or dropping him altogether. Although the label agreed to sign Red Noise, they were taken aback when hearing ''Sound-on-Sound''.

[[Bill Nelson's Red Noise]], released in February 1979 by record label [[Harvest Records|Harvest]]. Band leader [[Bill Nelson]] formed the group after the disbandment of [[Be-Bop Deluxe]] in 1978. The record was recorded with producer and engineer [[John Leckie]], and marks a stylistic change for Nelson with its emphasis on [[synthesizer]]s. His lyrics were inspired by [[science fiction]] and [[dystopian]] themes, which the musician tried to present in a humorous way. The album cover, featuring a bed-ridden robot, was photographed by [[Bishin Jumonji]]\n\nPromoted by the singles \"Furniture Music\" and \"Revolt Into Style\", ''Sound-on-Sound'' reached number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and perplexed fans and music critics, with criticism centred on its 'artificial' sound. EMI, Harvest's parent label, dropped Nelson in July 1979, rendering ''Sound-on-Sound'' their only album. It has been re-released by Harvest several times, including as a deluxe edition in 2012, and has been reappraised in a positive light by critics.\n\n== Background and recording==\nSince their 1972 inception, Bill Nelson was the leader and guitarist of eclectic rock band [[Be-Bop Deluxe]], with whom he achieved some success,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=Be-Bop Deluxe Artist Biography by William Ruhlmann |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/be-bop-deluxe-mn0000127337/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> but later found himself restricted as the group's guitarist.<ref name=\"Robbins\">{{cite web |last1=Robbins |first1=Ira |title=Bill Nelson |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=bill_nelson |website=Trouser Press |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> With the band's final album, ''[[Drastic Plastic]]'' (1978), Nelson felt his ideas were marginalised compared to those of his bandmates, describing the record as disrupting the \"transitional stage\" he envisioned exploring between their previous album ''[[Modern Music (Be-Bop Deluxe album)|Modern Music]]'' (1976) and what became ''Sound-on-Sound''. As such, he dissolved Be-Bop Deluxe, feeling that beginning a new band was \"the only way to do what I wanted to do.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> He had wished to dissolve the group before ''Drastic Plastic'' was recorded, but was persuaded by the band's management to continue. \"Had I gotten my way,\" Nelson later said, \"the ''Drastic Plastic'' material would have been recorded as the first Red Noise album. Instead, I adapted it for the final Be Bop album.\"<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\n[[File:Minimoog.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Minimoog]] is one of the most-used synths on ''Sound-on-Sound''.]]\nBy forming Bill Nelson's Red Noise, the musician again exerted creative control, paying the other members as [[session musician]]s. He described the decision to form a band, rather than present himself as a solo musician with \"an anonymous backing group\", as a way of \"hiding\" and avoid being trapped \"in a specific mould\" if he achieved major success, saying: \"This way I can change whatever cover I have to work under when my ideas alter or develop.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Be-Bop Deluxe keyboardist [[Andy Clarke]] joined Nelson in Red Noise, with the line-up completed by Bill's brother [[Ian Nelson (musician)|Ian]] on saxophone and [[jazz]] bassist Rick Ford. Drumming on ''Sound-on-Sound'' is split between Nelson and [[Dave Mattacks]].<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> The group recorded the album at [[Townhouse Studios]], [[London]], with producer and engineer [[John Leckie]].<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Nelson had worked with Leckie since [[Axe Victim|the first Be-Bop Deluxe album]] and found their partnership had developed into a \"very give-and-take\" fashion.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\nRecording the album was simpler process than any Be-Bop Deluxe record due to the prevalence of synthesizers, which Nelson felt were \"much richer, [[tonality|tonally]], than you realise,\" and only used [[overdubbing|overdubs]] to emphasise a specific sound, typically guitars. He elaborated: \"With a synthesizer you press a switch and a sound is the direct result. With a guitar you pluck a string, which resonates above a [[pickup (music technology)|pick-up]], which then sends a signal along a wire to an amplifier, etc, etc, etc. It's a thinner sound altogether, which is why we can reproduce the album material so much more simply onstage using a lot of electronic instruments.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The influence of [[electronic music]] on Nelson in the period, including groups like the [[the Residents]], led him to begin using a [[synthesizer guitar]] instead of an ordinary one, and processing snare drums through [[fuzzbox]]es, among other experimentation.<ref name=\"Randall\">{{cite journal |last1=Randall |first1=Mac |title=Robert Wyatt & Bill Nelson: Tough Guys Don't Dance |journal=Musician |date=August 1992 |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/robert-wyatt--bill-nelson-tough-guys-dont-dance- |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> The most prominent synths on the album are the [[Minimoog]] and [[Yamaha CS80]].<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Several songs on the album were remixed at Utopia Studios, London.<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Upon completion, Nelson felt unusually proud of the album, whereas with Be-Bop Deluxe albums he \"couldn't bear to hear them for two months afterwards.\"<ref name=\"Mitchell\" />\n\n==Composition==\nNelson wrote the songs on ''Sound-on-Sound'' about \"mundane, domestic things,\" citing \"electronic appliances, factories...the paraphernalia of the times,\" and commenting that the album's instrumentation and arrangements reflect this.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> He said the \"basic concept\" behind the record was to explore all the [[science fiction]] themes he \"hinted at\" with Be-Bop Deluxe, who had one song on each album with such themes.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Jim |title=Bill Nelson: Triumph of the Bill |journal=Trouser Press |date=November 1981 |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/bill-nelson-triumph-of-the-bill |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> He drew inspiration from dystopian novels like [[E.M. Forster]]'s ''[[The Machine Stops]]'', [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' and those by [[George Orwell]], as well as the imagery of [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), but also felt the album had a \"future-kitsch element\", highlighting its \"slight tongue-in-cheek quality that suggests humorous absurdity\" and describing the album as exploring its sinister concepts playfully.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite web |title=Sound-on-Soud |title=Bill Nelson |url= https://www.billnelson.com/sound-on-sound |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> According to critic Michael Waynick, the album's lyrics explore a wide palette of 20th century dystopian fantasies, ranging from \"[[Soviet]]-style [[social realism]] to state-sponsored [[lobotomy]],\"<ref name=\"Waynick\" /> while writer Daryl Easlea describes the album as [[modernistic]] and \"full of ''[[1984 (novel)|1984]]''-style portent.\"<ref name=\"Easlea\">{{cite web |last1=Easlea |first1=Daryl |title=Bill Nelson's Red Noise |url=https://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/sound-on-sound |website=Record Collector |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe music is characterised by its mechanical synthesizers, harsh guitars and frenzied rhythms.<ref name=\"Waynick\" /> By emphasising synthesised instrumentation, and eschewing guitar solos, the record marks a firm departure from Be-Bop Deluxe,<ref name=\"Robbins\" /> with Red Noise moving Nelson into a [[new wave music|new wave]] direction,<ref>{{cite web |title=Deluxe Edition |url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/deluxe-edition |website=Record Collector |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=My Bizarre Double Life In The Pop World Of The Eighties |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/my-bizarre-double-life-in-the-pop-world-of-the-eighties |website=Beverly Glick |accessdate=20 April 2020 |date=2005}}</ref> although a guitar solo does appear on \"The Atom Age\".<ref name=\"Waynick\" /> Nelson wrote some songs to break from \"the idea of a rhythm which starts at point A and goes to point B by a logical progression,\" instead building songs like \"Don't Touch Me (I'm Electric)\", \"Stop/Go/Stop\" and \"Radar in My Heart\" in a more abnormal fashion until the results were \"a little bit angular; you can't just flow through them, yet their urgency creates its own kind of flow.\"<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Tony |title=Revolt into Style |journal=Trouser Press |date=1979 |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20131022005912/https://www.billnelson.com/usarchives/interview/tp1979.htm |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> The musician described the musical structure of \"Art/Empire/Industy\" as a jokey experiment \"using a kind of [[Beatles]]' '[[Twist & Shout]]' build-up but with modern instrumentation and techniques.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> He wrote \"Stop/Go/Stop\" \u2013 which features the line \"To Central Information, from Intelligence Patrol/We all must follow orders, obey remote control\" \u2013 in 1977 about his future-wife Jan while he was still married to his first wife. He married Jan by the recording of ''Sound-on-Sound'' and reflected on the song: \"I'd been trying to tell Jan how I felt about her through my songs. They were born out of this heady love I was feeling for her.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n== Release and reception ==\nThe sleeve of ''Sound-on-Sound'' was designed by Japanese artist [[Bishin Jumonji]],<ref name=\"Easlea\" /> and depicts a bed-ridden robot constructed of both electronic and [[electromechanic]]al components, chosen by Nelson to represent the album's 'mundane, domestic' themes.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The back cover features an \"Important Notice\" writing that the album was \"styled with today's [[hi-fi]] in mind,\" saying that the record should be \"played at high volume in a room with no views other than those affored by the use of subliminal image video apparatus.\"<ref name=\"booklet\" /> Nelson said he wrote the notice with his \"[[Tongue-in-cheek|tongue firmly in cheek]]\".<ref name=\"Nelson\" /> During the band's live performances, the group wore [[Red Army]]-style matching uniforms and used intricate lighting to \"underline the point of the music,\" according to Nelson, who elaborated: \"The songs are about the impending gloom of 1984, the austerity and the indoctrination. But I wanted to present the band as the perpetrators rather than the victims. The uniforms are part of that.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\nAfter disbanding Be-Bop Deluxe, Nelson gave [[EMI]] \u2013 parent company of [[Harvest Records]], whom the band were signed to \u2013 a choice between signing Red Noise or dropping him altogether. Although the label agreed to sign Red Noise, they were taken aback when hearing ''Sound-on-Sound''. Nelson elaborated: \"A friend had dinner with EMI's head of A&R and told me he'd been asked, 'What's wrong with Bill? Why's he doing all this crazy music?'\"<ref name=\"Green\" /> Harvest released ''Sound-on-Sound'' on 16 February 1979,<ref name=\"Nelson\" /> with the lead single \"Furniture Music\" being issued the same month.<ref name=\"Easlea\" /> While the album jarred Nelson's fan base,<ref name=\"McDonald\">{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Steven |title=Artist Biography by Steven McDonald |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-nelson-mn0000769238/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> it debuted and peaked at number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], where it stayed for five weeks, while \"Furniture Music\" reached number 59 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], with \"Revolt Into Style\" reaching number 69 in May.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Nelson's Red Noise |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17474/bill-nelsons-red-noise/ |website=Official Charts |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> In the United States, where the album was released by [[Capitol Records]], it was a commercial failure.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\n''Sound-on-Sound'' was released to polarising reviews from music critics, some of whom panned its intricate sound and compared it unfavourably with the work of [[Talking Heads]] and [[T.

He also rejected criticisms of the album being too dense and layered as \"it was recorded so much more simply than the Be-bop albums.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Following the album's disappointing sales in the US, Nelson was dropped by Capitol.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In the UK, EMI dropped Nelson altogether in July 1979, alongside other groups like [[Wire (band)|Wire]], as the label was slimming down its roster and looking for more commercially viable artists.<ref name=\"Green\" /><ref name=\"McDonald\" /> By that point, Nelson had been working on a second Red Noise album, which was intended for an August 1979 release, but the dropping left the tapes with EMI. He reworked some of the material for his solo album ''Quit Dreaming and Get on the Beam'' (1981); Nelson's prioritisation of solo material effectively ended Bill Nelson's Red Noise,<ref name=\"Green\"

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place.

In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cusco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua|Cuzco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

She '''went''' \"Who are you going with?\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n:: d. He''''s all''' \"Okay, come with me come with me\"<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\nIn conversational speech, the use of ''say'' and ''be like'' occurs at about the same frequency,<ref name=\"frederica\"/> though ''say'' tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and ''be like'' tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).<ref name=\"adfoolen\"/>\n\n=====Japanese=====\n\nIn Japanese, the quotative particle ''to'' along with the verb of saying ''iu'' (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of ''iu'' (say) is ''itta'':<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker AKK=Accusative COM=Complementizer HON=Honorific/Polite form\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u592a\u90ce || \u306f || \u6674\u6d77\u3000|| \u3092 || \u618e\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n|-\n| Taro || wa || Harumi || o || nikundeiru || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Taro || TOP || Harumi || AKK || hated || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''Taro said that he hated Harumi.''\" lit. \"''that 'I hated Harumi'''\"\n|}\n\nThe quotative particle ''to'' can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as ''omou'' (think). Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]].<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -'''\u3063\u3066'''\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| ashita || hareru || '''tte'''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -'''\u3063\u3066'''/'''\u3068''' || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| ashita || hareru || '''tte'''/'''to''' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb.\n\nGloss: PL=Plural FUT=Future Tense PST=Past Tense OBL=Oblique Case IRR= Irregular\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | [[Ngarinyin language|Ngarinyin]] example <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/> \n|-\n| wurlan || wurr-u-miyangga || bud-ma-ra-ngarrugu\n|-\n| word || 3PL-FUT-know || 3PL-say-PST-1PL.OBL.IRR\n|-\n| colspan=7|''\"They will know this word\" they said to us.''\n|}\n\n====Quotative evidentials====\nQuotative or hearsay evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech based on logical assumption. Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cuzco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials. Even in languages that have \"true\" quotative evidentials, they are limited to interrogative and imperative quotations. <ref name=\"quechua\"/><ref name=\"SRL Ev\">{{cite journal |last1=San Roque |first1=Lila |title=Evidentiality |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=2019 |volume=48 |issue= |pages=353\u2013370 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102218-011243 }}</ref> Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] from full lexical verbs.<ref name=\"Chojnicka Latvian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chojnicka |first1=Joanna |title=Latvian verbs of speaking and their relations to evidentiality |journal=Kalbotyra |issue=69 |pages=59\u201381}}</ref>\n\n[[Nheengatu|Nh\u00eaengat\u00fa]], a Tup\u00ed-Guaran\u00ed [[lingua franca]] of North-West Amazonia, has a reported evidential marker ''pa\u00e1''.

The champions were Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w, who won their 2nd Polish title.\n\nBy the PZPN decision, the next Polish championships were not to take place until 1925, because the Polish championships in 1924 were abandoned as a result of preparations of the [[Poland national football team|Polish national team]] to participate in the [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympic Football Tournament]].\n\n==Competition modus==\nThe final tournaments started on 12 August 1923 and concluded on 4 November 1923 (spring-autumn system). In each of groups the season was played as a [[round-robin tournament]]. A total of 8 teams participated. Each team played a total of 6 matches, half at home and half away, two games against each other team. Teams received two points for a win and one point for a draw.
