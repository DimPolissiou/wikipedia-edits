The series follows the misadventures of cynical [[mad scientist]] [[Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)|Rick Sanchez]] and his good-hearted but fretful grandson [[Morty Smith]], who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.\n\nRoiland voices the eponymous characters, with [[Chris Parnell]], [[Spencer Grammer]] and [[Sarah Chalke]] voicing the rest of the family. The series originated from an animated [[Short film|short]] [[parody film]] of ''[[Back to the Future]]'', created by Roiland for [[Channel 101]], a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.\n\nThe series has been picked up for an additional seventy episodes over an unspecified number of seasons, beginning with [[Rick and Morty (season 4)|season 4]]. The fourth season premiered on November 10, 2019 consists of ten episodes.\n\n==Premise and main characters==\n{{see also|List of Rick and Morty characters}}\n[[File:Rick and Morty characters.jpg|thumb|left|380px|The members of the Smith household. From the left: Jerry, Beth, Summer, [[Morty Smith|Morty]], and [[Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)|Rick]]]]\n\nThe show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Jerry Smith|Jerry]] and [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Beth Smith|Beth]], their children [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Summer Smith|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]], and Beth's father, [[Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)|Rick Sanchez]], who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=772269394084802560 |user=JustinRoiland |title=Washington state- outside of Seattle |author=Justin Roiland |date=September 4, 2016 |access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> The adventures of ''Rick and Morty'', however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the characters travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car.\n\nRick is an eccentric and alcoholic [[mad scientist]], who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose na\u00efve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.\n\nDifferent versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the [[multiverse]] and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's original Rick identifies himself as \"Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-[[Fine-structure constant|137]]\", in reference to his original universe, but this does not necessarily apply to every other member of the Smith household. For instance, in the first-season episode \"[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]\", after turning the entire world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different dimension, leaving Summer, Beth and Jerry behind.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Rick and Morty episodes}}\n<div style=\"max-width:100%; float:left; margin-right:2em;\">{{:List of Rick and Morty episodes}}</div>\n\nIn May 2012, Adult Swim unveiled its development slate that included a ''Rick and Morty'' [[Television pilot|pilot]] from Harmon and Roiland,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2012/05/adult-swim-puts-animated-harold-kumar-series-in-development-greenlights-seven-pilots-272740/ |title=Adult Swim Puts Animated 'Harold & Kumar' In Development, Greenlights Seven Pilots |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=May 15, 2012 |website=Deadline |access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> which was eventually picked up to series in October 2012, as one of the network's first primetime original shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2012/10/adult-swim-picks-up-dan-harmons-animated-comedy-rick-morty-to-series-361510/ |title=Adult Swim Picks Up Dan Harmon's Animated Comedy 'Rick & Morty' To Series |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=October 29, 2012 |website=Deadline |access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> The first season premiered in December 2013 and concluded in April 2014.

The duo first met at [[Channel 101]], a non-profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles co-founded by Harmon.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> At Channel 101, participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot, and a live audience decides which pilots continue as a series. Roiland, then a producer on reality programming, began submitting content to the festival a year after its launch, in 2004. His pilots typically consisted of [[shock value]]\u2014\"sick and twisted\" elements that received a confused reaction from the audience.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Nevertheless, Harmon took a liking to his humor and the two began collaborating. In 2006, Roiland was fired from working on a television series he regarded as intensely creatively stifling, and funneled his creative energies into creating a webisode for Channel 101. The result was ''The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti'', an animated short starring parodies of [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] and [[Marty McFly]], characters from the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' film trilogy]].<ref name=\"Czajkowski 2013-11-12\">{{Cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2013/11/dan-harmons-rick-and-morty-premieres-on-adult-swim-on-dec-2/ |title=Dan Harmon's ''Rick and Morty'' Premieres on Adult Swim on Dec. 2 |publisher=The Awl |work=Splitsider |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=November 26, 2013 |last=Czajkowski |first=Elise |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702121402/http://splitsider.com/2013/11/dan-harmons-rick-and-morty-premieres-on-adult-swim-on-dec-2/ |archive-date=July 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the short, which Harmon would dub \"a bastardization, a pornographic vandalization\", Doc Smith urges Mharti that the solution to all of his problems is to give him [[oral sex]].<ref name=\"hitfix\">{{Cite news |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |date=March 24, 2014 |title=Mega Dan Harmon interview, part 3: 'Rick and Morty' |url=http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/mega-dan-harmon-interview-part-3-rick-and-morty/ |publisher=[[HitFix]] |accessdate=February 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227231747/https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/mega-dan-harmon-interview-part-3-rick-and-morty/ |archive-date=February 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The audience reacted to it wildly, and Roiland began creating more shorts involving the characters, which soon evolved beyond his original intentions and their obvious origin within the film from which it was culled.<ref name=\"hitfix\"/><ref name=\"lat\">{{Cite news |first=Yvonne |last=Villarreal |date=March 5, 2014 |title=Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland talk bringing absurd to 'Rick and Morty' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/05/entertainment/la-et-st-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-bringing-the-absurd-to-adult-swims-rick-and-morty-20140304 |accessdate=October 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005042531/http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/05/entertainment/la-et-st-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-bringing-the-absurd-to-adult-swims-rick-and-morty-20140304 |archive-date=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Harmon would later create and produce ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', an [[NBC]] sitcom, while Roiland would work primarily in voice acting for [[Disney Channel|Disney]]'s ''[[Fish Hooks]]'' and [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Adventure Time]]''.\n\nIn 2012, Harmon was briefly fired from ''Community''. Adult Swim, searching for a more prime-time, \"hit\" show,<ref name=\"crave\"/> approached Harmon shortly afterward, who initially viewed the channel as unfit for his style. He also was unfamiliar with animation, and his process for creating television focuses more heavily on dialogue, characters, and story.<ref name=\"lat\"/> Instead, he phoned Roiland to inquire if he had any ideas for an animated series. Roiland immediately brought up the idea of using the Doc and Mharti characters, renamed Rick and Morty.<ref name=\"hitfix\"/> Roiland initially wanted the show's run time to consist of one eleven-minute segment, but Adult Swim pushed for a half-hour program.<ref name=\"crave\">{{Cite news |first=Fred |last=Topel |date=December 2, 2013 |title=Exclusive Interview: Dan Harmon & Justin Roiland on 'Rick and Morty' |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/interviews/612291-exclusive-interview-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-rick-and-morty |access-date=October 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026042114/http://www.craveonline.com/tv/interviews/612291-exclusive-interview-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-rick-and-morty |archive-date=October 26, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Harmon felt the best way to extend the voices into a program would be to build a family around the characters, while Adult Swim development executive [[Nick Weidenfeld]] suggested that Rick be Morty's grandfather. Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the ground, Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to give notes on his pitch.<ref name=\"hitfix\"/> Prior to developing ''Rick and Morty'', he had created three failed animated pilots for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and he had begun to feel \"burned out\" with developing television.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\nThe first draft was completed in six hours on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in Dan Harmon's unfurnished ''Community'' office.<ref name=\"HarmonCommentary\">{{Cite AV media notes |work=Rick and Morty season 1 |title=Commentary for the episode \"Pilot\" |first=Dan |last=Harmon |year=2014 |medium=Blu-ray Disc |publisher=Warner Bros.

Stay here right now and we can write it in six hours.' He just had a premonition about that,\" recalled Harmon.<ref name=\"lat\"/> Adult Swim was initially unsure of Roiland doing both voices, partially due to the undeveloped nature of the character of Morty. Harmon wrote four short premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to [[Mike Lazzo]].<ref name=\"HarmonCommentary\"/> Adult Swim placed a tamer [[TV-14]] rating on the program, which initially was met with reluctance from the show's staff. The network's reason behind the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime-time, competing with major programs.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\nThe theme song for ''Rick and Morty'' by Ryan Elder was originally used in a rejected Cartoon Network pilot Roiland made called \"Dog World\", which was referenced in the episode \"[[Lawnmower Dog]]\".<ref name=\"RyanElderComposer\">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN61CU3njsE/ |title=How One Guy Scored \"Rick and Morty\", TV\u2019s Weirdest Cartoon |type=[[YouTube]] |people=Ryan Elder |publisher=Great Big Story |date=August 1, 2017 |accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n\nHarmon has noted that the writers' room at the show's studio bears a striking resemblance to the one used for ''Community''.<ref name=\"lat\"/> In comparing the two, he noted that the writing staff of ''Rick and Morty'' was significantly smaller, and more \"rough and tumble verbally\".<ref name=\"lat\"/> The first season writing staff consisted of Roiland, Harmon, Tom Kauffman, Ryan Ridley, Wade Randolph, and Eric Acosta, while writer's assistant Mike McMahan was also given writing credit.

Roiland and Harmon do a \"pass\" on the outline, and from there the episode undergoes several more drafts. The final draft of the script is last approved by either of the co-creators.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Harmon has admitted that his perfectionism can sometimes be disruptive and cause writing schedule delays.

The series follows the misadventures of cynical [[mad scientist]] [[Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)|Rick Sanchez]] and his good-hearted but fretful grandson [[Morty Smith]], who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.\n\nRoiland voices the eponymous characters, with [[Chris Parnell]], [[Spencer Grammer]] and [[Sarah Chalke]] voicing the rest of the family. The series originated from an animated [[Short film|short]] [[parody film]] of ''[[Back to the Future]]'', created by Roiland for [[Channel 101]], a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.\n\nThe series has been picked up for an additional seventy episodes over an unspecified number of seasons, beginning with [[Rick and Morty (season 4)|season 4]]. The fourth season premiered on November 10, 2019 and will consist of ten episodes.\n\n==Premise and main characters==\n{{see also|List of Rick and Morty characters}}\n[[File:Rick and Morty characters.jpg|thumb|left|380px|The members of the Smith household. From the left: Jerry, Beth, Summer, [[Morty Smith|Morty]], and [[Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)|Rick]]]]\n\nThe show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Jerry Smith|Jerry]] and [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Beth Smith|Beth]], their children [[List of Rick and Morty characters#Summer Smith|Summer]] and [[Morty Smith|Morty]], and Beth's father, [[Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)|Rick Sanchez]], who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=772269394084802560 |user=JustinRoiland |title=Washington state- outside of Seattle |author=Justin Roiland |date=September 4, 2016 |access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> The adventures of ''Rick and Morty'', however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the characters travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car.\n\nRick is an eccentric and alcoholic [[mad scientist]], who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose na\u00efve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.\n\nDifferent versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the [[multiverse]] and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's original Rick identifies himself as \"Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-[[Fine-structure constant|137]]\", in reference to his original universe, but this does not necessarily apply to every other member of the Smith household. For instance, in the first-season episode \"[[Rick Potion No. 9|Rick Potion #9]]\", after turning the entire world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different dimension, leaving Summer, Beth and Jerry behind.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Rick and Morty episodes}}\n<div style=\"max-width:100%; float:left; margin-right:2em;\">{{:List of Rick and Morty episodes}}</div>\n\nIn May 2012, Adult Swim unveiled its development slate that included a ''Rick and Morty'' [[Television pilot|pilot]] from Harmon and Roiland,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2012/05/adult-swim-puts-animated-harold-kumar-series-in-development-greenlights-seven-pilots-272740/ |title=Adult Swim Puts Animated 'Harold & Kumar' In Development, Greenlights Seven Pilots |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=May 15, 2012 |website=Deadline |access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> which was eventually picked up to series in October 2012, as one of the network's first primetime original shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2012/10/adult-swim-picks-up-dan-harmons-animated-comedy-rick-morty-to-series-361510/ |title=Adult Swim Picks Up Dan Harmon's Animated Comedy 'Rick & Morty' To Series |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=October 29, 2012 |website=Deadline |access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref> The first season premiered in December 2013 and concluded in April 2014.

The duo first met at [[Channel 101]], a non-profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles co-founded by Harmon.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> At Channel 101, participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot, and a live audience decides which pilots continue as a series. Roiland, then a producer on reality programming, began submitting content to the festival a year after its launch, in 2004. His pilots typically consisted of [[shock value]]\u2014\"sick and twisted\" elements that received a confused reaction from the audience.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Nevertheless, Harmon took a liking to his humor and the two began collaborating. In 2006, Roiland was fired from working on a television series he regarded as intensely creatively stifling, and funneled his creative energies into creating a webisode for Channel 101. The result was ''The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti'', an animated short starring parodies of [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]] and [[Marty McFly]], characters from the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' film trilogy]].<ref name=\"Czajkowski 2013-11-12\">{{Cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2013/11/dan-harmons-rick-and-morty-premieres-on-adult-swim-on-dec-2/ |title=Dan Harmon's ''Rick and Morty'' Premieres on Adult Swim on Dec. 2 |publisher=The Awl |work=Splitsider |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=November 26, 2013 |last=Czajkowski |first=Elise |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702121402/http://splitsider.com/2013/11/dan-harmons-rick-and-morty-premieres-on-adult-swim-on-dec-2/ |archive-date=July 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the short, which Harmon would dub \"a bastardization, a pornographic vandalization\", Doc Smith urges Mharti that the solution to all of his problems is to give him [[oral sex]].<ref name=\"hitfix\">{{Cite news |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |date=March 24, 2014 |title=Mega Dan Harmon interview, part 3: 'Rick and Morty' |url=http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/mega-dan-harmon-interview-part-3-rick-and-morty/ |publisher=[[HitFix]] |accessdate=February 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227231747/https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/mega-dan-harmon-interview-part-3-rick-and-morty/ |archive-date=February 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The audience reacted to it wildly, and Roiland began creating more shorts involving the characters, which soon evolved beyond his original intentions and their obvious origin within the film from which it was culled.<ref name=\"hitfix\"/><ref name=\"lat\">{{Cite news |first=Yvonne |last=Villarreal |date=March 5, 2014 |title=Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland talk bringing absurd to 'Rick and Morty' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/05/entertainment/la-et-st-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-bringing-the-absurd-to-adult-swims-rick-and-morty-20140304 |accessdate=October 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005042531/http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/05/entertainment/la-et-st-dan-harmon-justin-roiland-on-bringing-the-absurd-to-adult-swims-rick-and-morty-20140304 |archive-date=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Harmon would later create and produce ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', an [[NBC]] sitcom, while Roiland would work primarily in voice acting for [[Disney Channel|Disney]]'s ''[[Fish Hooks]]'' and [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Adventure Time]]''.\n\nIn 2012, Harmon was briefly fired from ''Community''. Adult Swim, searching for a more prime-time, \"hit\" show,<ref name=\"crave\"/> approached Harmon shortly afterward, who initially viewed the channel as unfit for his style.

Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the ground, Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to give notes on his pitch.<ref name=\"hitfix\"/> Prior to developing ''Rick and Morty'', he had created three failed animated pilots for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and he had begun to feel \"burned out\" with developing television.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\nThe first draft was completed in six hours on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in Dan Harmon's unfurnished ''Community'' office.<ref name=\"HarmonCommentary\">{{Cite AV media notes |work=Rick and Morty season 1 |title=Commentary for the episode \"Pilot\" |first=Dan |last=Harmon |year=2014 |medium=Blu-ray Disc |publisher=Warner Bros.

Roiland and Harmon do a \"pass\" on the outline, and from there the episode undergoes several more drafts. The final draft of the script is last approved by either of the co-creators.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Harmon has admitted that his perfectionism can sometimes be disruptive and cause writing schedule delays.
