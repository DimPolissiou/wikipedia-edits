In [[theology|theological]] discussions, the practice is sometimes referred to as '''paedobaptism''', or '''pedobaptism''', from the Greek ''pais'' meaning \"child\". This can be contrasted with what is called \"[[believer's baptism]]\" (or credobaptism, from the Latin word ''credo'' meaning \"I believe\"), which is the religious practice of baptising only individuals who personally confess faith in [[Jesus]], therefore excluding underage children. Opposition to infant baptism is termed '''catabaptism'''. Infant baptism is also called '''christening''' by some faith traditions.\n\nMost [[Christianity|Christians]] belong to denominations that practice infant baptism.<ref>For instance, the Roman Catholic Church: 1,100,000,000 (about half of all Christians); the Eastern Orthodox Church: 225,000,000; 115,000,000 members of the Anglican churches; Lutherans and others ([http://www.adherents.com/adh_rb.html Religious Bodies of the World with at Least 1 Million Adherents;] [http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Denominational Families of Christianity).] See also [http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-1995]</ref> Branches of Christianity that practice infant baptism include [[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], and among [[Protestants]], several [[Christian denomination|denominations]]: [[Anglican]]s, [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Congregational churches|Congregationalists]] and other [[Calvinist|Reformed]] denominations, [[Methodism|Methodist]]s, [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarenes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2017.manual.nazarene.org/section/baptism-of-infants-or-young-children/|title=Baptism of Infants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and the [[Moravian Church]].\n\n== Ceremony == \nThe exact details of the baptismal [[ceremony]] vary among [[Christian denomination]]s. Many follow a prepared ceremony, called a [[rite]] or [[liturgy]]. In a typical ceremony, parents or [[godparent]]s bring their child to their congregation's [[priest]] or [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]. The rite used would be the same as that denomination's rite for adults, i.e., by pouring holy water ([[affusion]]) or by sprinkling water ([[aspersion]]). [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] traditions practise total immersion and baptise babies in a [[baptismal font|font]], and this practice is also the first method listed in the baptismal ritual of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], although pouring is the standard practice within the Latin branch of Catholicism. Catholic and Orthodox churches that do this do not sprinkle. At the moment of baptism, the minister utters the words \"I baptise you (or, 'The servant of God (name) is baptised') in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" (see [[Great Commission|Matthew 28:19]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAlthough it is not required, many parents and godparents choose to dress the baby in a white gown called a [[baptismal clothing|christening gown]] for the baptism ceremony. Christening gowns often become treasured keepsakes that are used by many other children in the family and handed down from generation to generation. Traditionally, this gown is white or slightly off white and made with much lace, trim and intricate detail. In the past, a gown was used for both boys and girls; in the present day it has become more common to dress children in a baptismal outfit. Also normally made of white fabric, the outfit consists of a [[romper suit|romper]] with a vest or other accessories.\nThese clothes are often kept as a memento after the ceremony.\n\nIt is a naval tradition to baptise children using the [[ship's bell]] as a baptismal font and to engrave the child's name on the bell afterwards. Tracking down and searching for an individual's name on a specific bell from a ship may be a difficult and time-consuming task.

The document then indicated some general guidelines for pastoral action.<ref name=CDF>[http://ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFINFAN.htm Instruction on Infant Baptism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720010902/http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFINFAN.htm |date=20 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe document recalled that infant baptism has long been considered of apostolic origin and that the first direct evidence of its practice, dating from the 2nd century, does not present it as an innovation. It then responded to objections that baptism should follow faith, that the person baptised should consciously receive the grace of the sacrament, that the person should freely accept baptism, that infant baptism is unsuitable in a society marked by instability of values and conflicts of ideas, and that the practice is inimical to a missionary outlook on the part of the Church.<ref>Instruction, Part II</ref>\n\nThe instruction then gave guidelines for pastoral practice, based on two principles. The major principle is that baptism, as the sign and means of God's love that precedes any action on our part and that frees from original sin and communicates divine life, must not be delayed. The subordinate principle is that assurances must be given that the gift thus granted can grow by authentic education in the faith and Christian life. If these assurances are not really serious, there can be grounds for delaying baptism. If they are certainly absent, the sacrament should even be refused.<ref>Instruction, 28</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the rules for involvement on the part of practising Christian parents must be supplemented with other considerations in the case of \"families with little faith or non-Christian families\". If these request that a child of theirs be baptised, there must be assurances that the child will be given the benefit of the Christian upbringing required by the sacrament. Examples of such assurances are \"the choice of godparents who will take sincere care of the child, or the support of the community\". If there is satisfactory assurance, i.e., \"any pledge giving a well-founded hope for the Christian upbringing of the children\", then \"the priest cannot refuse to celebrate the sacrament without delay, as in the case of children of Christian families\". If there is insufficient assurance, \"it will be prudent to delay baptism\", while keeping contact with the parents in the hope of securing the required conditions for celebrating the sacrament. As a last resort, enrollment of the child in a course of catechetical instruction on reaching school age can be offered in lieu of immediate celebration of baptism.<ref>Instruction, 30\u201331</ref> The possibility of delaying infant baptism in the case of non practicing or non believing parents raises a number of questions.  How can we discern that there are guarantees of an authentic Christian education?  Can a priest propose an alternative celebration in the case where baptism is to be delayed?  In some German speaking countries, bishops have opened the door to a \"two step baptism\", i.e. two celebrations separated by a time of evangelization of the parents.  In this case, the rite of baptism itself is to be performed in the second celebration, when parents are supposed to have enough maturity to raise the child in the Catholic faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Le bapt\u00eame des petits enfants dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9christianis\u00e9e|last=Jacobs|first=Bruno|publisher=Parole et Silence|year=2019|isbn=|location=Switzerland|pages=210\u2013231, 433\u2013515}}</ref>\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more [[exorcism]]s are pronounced over the candidate\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> In the [[Roman Rite]], the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: \"Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light.

This has fueled much debate within Methodism over the purpose of infant baptism, though most agree it should be continued.  Wesley and the Methodists would agree with the [[Reformed]] or [[Presbyterian]] denominations that infant baptism is symbolic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nInfant baptism is particularly illustrative of the Methodist doctrine of [[prevenient grace]]. The principle is that [[The Fall of Man]] ruined the human soul to such an extent that nobody ''wants'' a relationship with God. In order for humans to even want to be able to choose, God must empower their will (so that they may choose Christ) which he does by means of prevenient grace. Thus God takes the very first step in salvation, preceding any human effort or decision. Methodists justify infant baptism by this principle of prevenient grace, often arguing that infant baptism is God's promise or declaration to the infant that calls that infant to (eventually) believe in God's promises (God's Word) for salvation. When the individual believes in Jesus they will profess their faith before the church, often using a ritual called confirmation in which the Holy Spirit is invoked with the laying on of hands. Methodists also use infant baptism symbolically, as an illustration of God approaching the helpless. They see the ceremony additionally as a celebration of God's prevenient grace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nWesley was an Anglican minister who held to [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminian]] theology, unlike most Anglicans who held to Reformed (Calvinist) theology as taught in the [[39 Articles]].  Augustus Toplady, John Newton, and George Whitefield were all Anglican ministers and Calvinists.  They interpreted the Anglican formularies of the [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html 39 Articles of Religion], the [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/intro/contents.html 1662 Book of Common Prayer], and the [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#35 Second Book of the Anglican Homilies] from a Calvinist perspective and would have been more in agreement with the Reformed churches and the Puritans on the issue of infant baptism.  The [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/baptism/catchism.html Catechism] in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer shows that baptism was an outward sign of an inward grace.  Prevenient grace, according to the Calvinist Anglicans, referred to unconditional election and irresistible grace, which is necessary for conversion of the elect.  Infants are to be baptised because they are children of believers who stand in surety for them until they \"come of age\" and are bound to the same requirements of repentance and faith as adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed churches ====\n\nPresbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians believe that baptism, whether of infants or adults, is a \"sign and seal of the [[Covenant theology#Covenant of grace|covenant of grace]]\", and that baptism admits the party baptised into the [[visible church]].<ref>Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 28, Section 1.</ref> Being a member of the visible church does not guarantee salvation; though it does provide the child with many benefits, including that of one's particular congregation consenting to assist in the raising of that child in \"the way he should go, (so that) when he is old he will not turn from it\".  Elect infants (those [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] for salvation) who die in infancy are by faith considered regenerate on the basis of God's covenant promises in the covenant of grace.<ref>Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 10, Section 3.</ref>\n\nPresbyterian, Congregational and many Reformed Christians see infant baptism as the [[New Testament]] form of circumcision in the Jewish covenant ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 24:15). Circumcision did not create faith in the 8-day-old Jewish boy. It merely marked him as a member of God's covenant people Israel. Likewise, baptism doesn't create faith; it is a sign of membership in the visible covenant community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/a-brief-defense-of-infant-baptism/|title=A Brief Defense of Infant Baptism|last=DeYoung|first=Kevin|website=The Gospel Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nPresbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians consider children of professing Christians to be members of the visible Church (the covenant community). They also consider them to be full members of the local congregation where their parents are members and members of the universal Church (the set of all true believers who make up the invisible church) unless and until they prove otherwise. Baptism is the mark of membership in the covenant of grace and in the universal church, although regeneration is not inseparably connected with baptism.<ref>Westminster Confession, Chapter 28, Section 1 and especially section 3.

Pedobaptism and credobaptism are positions which bubble up from theological views at a more fundamental level of one's theological system.\n* If baptism is a sign that a person is a member of God's covenant community, and if the children of believers are members of that community, it follows that the children of believers should receive the sign that they are members of God's covenant community by being baptised, as an infant is entitled to a passport that indicates the child as a member of a particular country.<ref>[[John Calvin|Calvin]] asked: \"If the children of believers are partakers of the covenant without the help of understanding, there is no reason why they should be barred from the sign merely because they cannot swear to the provisions of the covenant\" (Inst. 4, 16, 24, quoted in [http://www.reformedtheology.ca/baptism.html John Calvin: Infant Baptism])</ref>\n* Believers and the children of believers become members of God's covenant community (or church) through baptism.<ref>\"If baptism was demanded of the Jews as a prerequisite of church membership, we may reasonably conclude that the Gentiles were not admitted to the privilege except on the same condition\" ([http://www.pbministries.org/Theology/J.%20B.%20Jeter/baptist_principles_reset/bpr_p1_02.htm Baptism a Condition of Church Membership]).</ref>\n* It is believed by some Christians that in the heart of a baptised child, faith as a gift or grace from God, as distinct from an act by the person, is made present.<ref>\"When an infant is baptised God creates faith in the heart of that infant.

Among the arguments made in support of the practice are:\n\n==== Argument based on parallel with circumcision ====\n\nSome supporters of infant baptism argue that circumcision is the sign of the covenant God made with Abraham and should be received by all the members of his covenant.<ref>Gen. 17:10\u201311</ref> The children of members of Abraham's covenant are themselves members of Abraham's covenant.<ref>Gen 17:7, Dt. 7:9, 30:6, 1Ch 16:15, Psa 103:17, 105:8</ref> Christians are members of Abraham's covenant <ref>Galatians 3:6\u20139 & Galatians 3:26\u201329; Romans 11.17\u201324; Rom. 4:16; Eph. 2:11\u201313; Eph. 3:3\u20136; Rom 2:28\u201329; 1 Peter 2:9; Gal. 6:16; Phil 3:2\u20133.</ref> Therefore, the children of Christians are members of Abraham's covenant.<ref>1 Cor. 7:14; Acts 2:38</ref> Since baptism is the New Testament form of circumcision,<ref>Col. 2:11\u201312</ref> the children of Christians should receive the sign of the covenant by being baptised.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Covenant theology ====\n\n[[Presbyterian]], [[Congregational churches|Congregationalists]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Christians base their case for infant baptism on [[Covenant theology]]. [[Covenant theology]] is a broad interpretative framework used to understand the Bible. [[Reformed Baptist]]s are in many ways [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] yet, as their name suggests, adhere to [[Believers Baptism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[Covenant theology]] God makes two basic [[Covenant (religion)|covenants]], or agreements, with humans. The first one, the [[Covenant of works|Covenant of Works]] is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on human obedience and morality. The covenant was made with [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam broke this covenant so God replaced it with a second more durable covenant\u2014the Covenant of Grace. The Covenant of Grace is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on God's grace and generosity. The Covenant of Works failed because it was based on human performance. The Covenant of Grace is durable because it is based on God's performance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAll the covenants that God makes with humans after the [[The Fall of Man|Fall]], (e.g. with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David) all extend the Covenant of Grace to its logical conclusion in Jesus Christ. In Covenant theology, however, there is a long-standing understanding that the Mosaic Covenant is also a republication of the Covenant of Works, which required obedience to receive its benefits. The underlying Covenant of Grace extends through the whole Old Testament, which suggests that two covenants are in play throughout the history of Israel. Consequently, Covenant theologians see that the Church, or the people of God, existed in the Old Testament. These are the people who placed their faith in Christ in advance, and they are saved in the same way Christians are. Not every Israelite is in the Church (or elect), many exist under the Covenant of Works and its strict unattainable requirements, but not under the Covenant of Grace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[Presbyterian]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Christians, this theological framework is important to the Biblical case for infant baptism because it provides a reason for thinking there is strong continuity between the Old and New Testaments. It provides a bridge linking the two Testaments together.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nCovenant Theologians claim that the [[New Testament]] book of [[Hebrews]] demonstrates that much of Israel's worship has been replaced by the person and work of Christ. The result is that some important forms of worship in the Old Testament have New Testament equivalents. The Passover festival, for example, was replaced by the Lord's Supper (or Eucharist).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIt is across the bridge of Covenant Theology that the sign of Abraham's covenant, circumcision, walks into the New Testament. The sign of the Covenant changes its external form to reflect new spiritual realities. It was a bloody sign in the Old Testament but because Christ has shed His blood, it has been transformed into a bloodless sign, i.e. washing with water. Passover was a bloody form of Old Testament worship and also transitions into the New Testament in the bloodless form of bread and wine.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nCovenant theologians point out that the external sign of the covenant in the Old Testament was circumcision. Circumcision was performed upon the male children of Israelites to signify their external membership in God's people, not as a guarantee of true faith; the Old Testament records many Israelites who turned from God and were punished, showing that their hearts were not truly set on serving God. So while all male Israelites had the sign of the covenant performed on them in a once off ceremony soon after birth, such a signifier was external only and not a true indicator of whether or not they would later exhibit true faith in Yahweh.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn the New Testament, circumcision is no longer seen as mandatory for God's people. However, there is compelling{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} evidence to suggest that the Old Testament circumcision rite has been replaced by baptism. For instance: \"In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, buried with Him in baptism.\" (Colossians 2:11\u201312a){{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome paedobaptists, then, think the analogy of baptism to circumcision correctly points to children, since the historic Israelite application of circumcision was to infants, not to adult converts, of which there were few. Covenant theology, then, identifies baptism less as a statement of faith than as an assumption of identity; that is to say that infant baptism is a sign of covenantal inclusion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeYoung |first1=Kevin |title=A Brief Defense of Infant Baptism |url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/a-brief-defense-of-infant-baptism/ |website=www.thegospelcoalition.org |accessdate=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Corroborating evidence ====\n\nPaedobaptists point to a number of passages in the New Testament which seem to corroborate the above argument.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Household baptisms =====\n\nIn the Old Testament, if the head of a household converted to Judaism, all the males in the house, even the infants, were circumcised. Some paedobaptists argue this pattern continues into the New Testament. Reference is made, for example, to baptising a person ''and their whole household''\u2014the households of [[Lydia (name)|Lydia]], [[Crispus]], and Stephanas are mentioned by name [http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?acts+16:14-15;18:8;1cor+1:16 Acts 16:14\u201315, 18:8; 1 Cor 1:16].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nPaedobaptists challenge credobaptists on this point: Why would a whole household be baptised just because the head of the house had faith? Shouldn't they baptise each member of the family as they come to individual faith? Household baptism implies that the rules for membership in Abraham's covenant have continued into the New Testament, the main difference is the sign of the covenant.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nCredobaptists counter with verses such as John 4:53, Acts 16:34 and Acts 18:8 in which entire households are said to have \"believed\". As such, the paedobaptist assumption is that household baptisms mentioned in the Bible involved infants, presumably incapable of personal belief.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Original sin =====\n\nPaedobaptists also point to [http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?psalm+51 Psalm 51], which reads, in part, \"surely I was sinful from birth\", as indication that infants are sinful (''vid.'' [[original sin]]) and are thus in need of forgiveness that they too might have salvation.\n\nCredobaptists agree that infants are in need of salvation, but paedobaptists push the point a step further arguing that it makes no theological sense for infants to need salvation but for God to make no provision for them to be saved (See 1 Cor 7:14 where Paul says that the children of a believer are holy\u2014separated\u2014and therefore, perhaps, would not need baptising even if baptism saved). Credobaptists recant that there is a provision through which God enables infants to be saved, belief on Jesus Christ (See Mark 9:42, John 3:14-21, John 11:25-26, Acts 2:21, Romans 10:1-21). Furthermore, credobaptists argue that paedobaptism is affirming believer's hereditary grace, a doctrine not found in scripture. Some credobaptists who agree to the Psalm 51 interpretation, argue that even though infants are sinful they are not accountable, because of the \"age of accountability\". Although many theologians would argue that an \"age of accountability\" is nowhere mentioned in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAn alternative viewpoint of some credobaptists is that since all Christians are predestined to salvation (John 15:16, 1 Cor.1:27, Eph.1:4, 1 Pt.2:4), God will not allow his elect to die before receiving their need, even if they are in old age (Luke 2:25\u201335), an argument whose relation to baptism whether of infants or adults is unclear, unless it means that infants who die without coming to explicit belief and baptism are not among God's elect.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAnother Credobaptist position is called predispositionalism. This suggests that baptism is only a mature response to eternal life, and that infants generate their inner response to God's presence, i.e. those who warm to him would, if dying in infancy, be with him eternally; contra-wise those who chilled to him.  This aligns to the idea of individual faith/welcome (Jhn.1:14).  Its point of determinism predates the age of evangelism, which it holds is still valid in crystallizing predisposition into maturing faith in this life. It considers shades of meaning in the keyword salvation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Words of Jesus =====\n\nIn John 3:5, [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] says, \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,\"<ref>John 3:5 (KJV)</ref> which, according to some religious groups, means that an infant who dies without being baptized cannot enter heaven and may go to [[limbo]] instead.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Peter's speech =====\nAccording to the [[Book of Acts]], \"Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptised, ''every one of you'', in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

(Luke 3:3, Mark 1:4, Acts 13:24, Acts 19:4){{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n*There are no instances of infant baptism in the scripture<ref name=\"desiringgod.org\"/>\n\nSome opponents{{Who|date=December 2018}} of paedobaptism point out that Jesus himself was baptised at the age of 30.\nThey also point to the two (out of five) [[Great Commission]] passages that speak of baptism. They see {{bibleverse||Matthew|28:18\u201320}} as giving exclusive instructions about who is to be baptised: \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you\" (verses 19\u201320, NKJV). They interpret this as referring to three successive stages, with baptism following on becoming a disciple (which is beyond the power of an infant), and instruction following on baptism, not preceding it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe {{bibleverse||Mark|16:15\u201318}} Great Commission passage speaks of believing: \"He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned\" (verse 16, NKJV). This, they say, excludes infants, whom they see as incapable of believing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\nIf pedobaptists accept this text as canonical, they can still point out that the second clause mentions believing, but not baptism. Therefore, one could be baptised and still not be a believer. They argue that this may not exclude infant baptism, but rather corroborate it, since it indicates that one baptised as an infant who rejects the faith is not saved against their will. Pedobaptists who accept this passage may also point out that although belief and baptism are both mentioned, there is no order implied. In return, opposers declare that baptism is for those who already believe and are able to state their belief, which infants cannot do. In Peter's address to adults, \"Repent and be baptised\" {{bibleverse||Acts|2:38}}, they see repentance as a prerequisite, and this requires a mature understanding of sin and a decision to turn away from sin. However, St. Peter was speaking to those who were already adults, not to infants. Pedobaptists claim that it would follow that his instructions are meant for adults and not for infants. Indeed, adult candidates for baptism are required by most branches that practice pedobaptism to make a confession of faith before baptism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Some{{who|date=December 2018}} point to {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:16}} or {{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:21}} as evidence that each individual must make a mature decision regarding baptism. See [[Believer's Baptism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome{{who|date=December 2018}} oppose baptism of children as ostensibly incorporating them into the church without their own consent. This, however does not absolve the responsibility of biblical parents to raise their children in the training and admonition of the Lord within the cultural context of the church.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nDenominations that do not accept infant baptism as valid generally require those who join them, after being baptised as infants elsewhere, to be \"rebaptised,\" or rather to be baptised for the first time. They deny that they in fact rebaptise, saying that Christians are to be baptised only once, but as believers, and they reject the term \"Anabaptist\" (i.e. Rebaptiser) as a description of them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Denominations and religious groups opposed to paedobaptism ====\nTrinitarian Christian denominations that oppose infant baptism include the [[Assemblies of God]], [[Association of Vineyard Churches]], [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]], [[Calvary Chapel]], [[Community Church movement|Community Churches]], [[Community of Christ]], [[Elim Pentecostal Church]], all [[Baptist]] denominations and including Independent Baptists, [[Gnostic Christianity|Gnostic Churches]], the groups which originated out of the [[Restoration Movement]] ([[Churches of Christ]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], and [[Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]]), as well as other [[nondenominational church]]es, [[International Churches of Christ]], [[International Christian Church]],<ref>http://www.newyorkcityicc.org/?p=1345</ref> [[Newfrontiers]], [[Foursquare Gospel Church]], [[Church of God in Christ]], [[Church of God of Prophecy]], [[Anabaptists]] (such as the [[Church of the Brethren]], [[Mennonite]], and [[Amish]]), [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]/German Baptists, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], some [[Methodist]]s, and most [[Pentecostal]] denominations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nSeveral [[nontrinitarian]] religious groups also oppose infant baptism, including [[Oneness Pentecostals]], [[Christadelphians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[United Church of God]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref name=\"EoM Infant Baptism\">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Norman |first= Keith E. |contribution= Infant Baptism |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3795 |pages= 682\u2013683 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

During the Reformation, Anabaptists were persecuted by Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican and Catholic regimes. The English government imposed restrictions on Baptists in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] during the 17th century. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] repressed Baptists prior to the [[1917 revolution]], and sought restrictions on Baptists and Pentecostals after being re-established after the fall of Communism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nB.R. White describes the motivations behind persecution of the Anabaptists during the Reformation as follows:\n<blockquote>\nOther Christians saw the baptism of each new-born baby into the secular parish community and close links between church and state as the divinely-ordained means of holding society together. Hence many other Christians saw the Anabaptists as subversive of all order. Consequently, from the earliest days, they were sharply persecuted and leaders were soon executed.<ref>Eerdman's Handbook to Christian Belief, William B.

The renewal of baptismal promises by those receiving the sacrament in the Western Catholic Church is incidental to the rite and not essentially different from the solemn renewal of their baptismal promises that is asked of all members of this Church each year at the [[Easter Vigil]] service. Only in French-speaking countries has there been a development of ceremonies, quite distinct from the sacrament of Confirmation, for young Catholics to profess their faith publicly, in line with their age.<ref>cf.

In [[theology|theological]] discussions, the practice is sometimes referred to as '''paedobaptism''', or '''pedobaptism''', from the Greek ''pais'' meaning \"child\". This can be contrasted with what is called \"[[believer's baptism]]\" (or credobaptism, from the Latin word ''credo'' meaning \"I believe\"), which is the religious practice of baptising only individuals who personally confess faith in [[Jesus]], therefore excluding underage children. Opposition to infant baptism is termed '''catabaptism'''. Infant baptism is also called '''christening''' by some faith traditions.\n\nMost [[Christianity|Christians]] belong to denominations that practice infant baptism.<ref>For instance, the Roman Catholic Church: 1,100,000,000 (about half of all Christians); the Eastern Orthodox Church: 225,000,000; 115,000,000 members of the Anglican churches; Lutherans and others ([http://www.adherents.com/adh_rb.html Religious Bodies of the World with at Least 1 Million Adherents;] [http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Denominational Families of Christianity).] See also [http://www.zpub.com/un/pope/relig.html Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-1995]</ref> Branches of Christianity that practice infant baptism include [[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], and among [[Protestants]], several [[Christian denomination|denominations]]: [[Anglican]]s, [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Congregational churches|Congregationalists]] and other [[Calvinist|Reformed]] denominations, [[Methodism|Methodist]]s, [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarenes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2017.manual.nazarene.org/section/baptism-of-infants-or-young-children/|title=Baptism of Infants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and the [[Moravian Church]].\n\n== Ceremony == \nThe exact details of the baptismal [[ceremony]] vary among [[Christian denomination]]s. Many follow a prepared ceremony, called a [[rite]] or [[liturgy]]. In a typical ceremony, parents or [[godparent]]s bring their child to their congregation's [[priest]] or [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]. The rite used would be the same as that denomination's rite for adults, i.e., by pouring holy water ([[affusion]]) or by sprinkling water ([[aspersion]]). [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] traditions practise total immersion and baptise babies in a [[baptismal font|font]], and this practice is also the first method listed in the baptismal ritual of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], although pouring is the standard practice within the Latin branch of Catholicism. Catholic and Orthodox churches that do this do not sprinkle. At the moment of baptism, the minister utters the words \"I baptise you (or, 'The servant of God (name) is baptised') in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\" (see [[Great Commission|Matthew 28:19]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAlthough it is not required, many parents and godparents choose to dress the baby in a white gown called a [[baptismal clothing|christening gown]] for the baptism ceremony. Christening gowns often become treasured keepsakes that are used by many other children in the family and handed down from generation to generation.

The document then indicated some general guidelines for pastoral action.<ref name=CDF>[http://ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFINFAN.htm Instruction on Infant Baptism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720010902/http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFINFAN.htm |date=20 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe document recalled that infant baptism has long been considered of apostolic origin and that the first direct evidence of its practice, dating from the 2nd century, does not present it as an innovation. It then responded to objections that baptism should follow faith, that the person baptised should consciously receive the grace of the sacrament, that the person should freely accept baptism, that infant baptism is unsuitable in a society marked by instability of values and conflicts of ideas, and that the practice is inimical to a missionary outlook on the part of the Church.<ref>Instruction, Part II</ref>\n\nThe instruction then gave guidelines for pastoral practice, based on two principles. The major principle is that baptism, as the sign and means of God's love that precedes any action on our part and that frees from original sin and communicates divine life, must not be delayed. The subordinate principle is that assurances must be given that the gift thus granted can grow by authentic education in the faith and Christian life. If these assurances are not really serious, there can be grounds for delaying baptism. If they are certainly absent, the sacrament should even be refused.<ref>Instruction, 28</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the rules for involvement on the part of practising Christian parents must be supplemented with other considerations in the case of \"families with little faith or non-Christian families\". If these request that a child of theirs be baptised, there must be assurances that the child will be given the benefit of the Christian upbringing required by the sacrament. Examples of such assurances are \"the choice of godparents who will take sincere care of the child, or the support of the community\". If there is satisfactory assurance, i.e., \"any pledge giving a well-founded hope for the Christian upbringing of the children\", then \"the priest cannot refuse to celebrate the sacrament without delay, as in the case of children of Christian families\". If there is insufficient assurance, \"it will be prudent to delay baptism\", while keeping contact with the parents in the hope of securing the required conditions for celebrating the sacrament. As a last resort, enrollment of the child in a course of catechetical instruction on reaching school age can be offered in lieu of immediate celebration of baptism.<ref>Instruction, 30\u201331</ref> The possibility of delaying infant baptism in the case of non practicing or non believing parents raises a number of questions.  How can we discern that there are guarantees of an authentic Christian education?  Can a priest propose an alternative celebration in the case where baptism is to be delayed?  In some German speaking countries, bishops have opened the door to a \"two step baptism\", i.e. two celebrations separated by a time of evangelization of the parents.  In this case, the rite of baptism itself is to be performed in the second celebration, when parents are supposed to have enough maturity to raise the child in the Catholic faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Le bapt\u00eame des petits enfants dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9christianis\u00e9e|last=Jacobs|first=Bruno|publisher=Parole et Silence|year=2019|isbn=|location=Switzerland|pages=210\u2013231, 433\u2013515}}</ref>\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more [[exorcism]]s are pronounced over the candidate\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3J.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> In the [[Roman Rite]], the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: \"Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light.

Similar to the Roman Catholic Church, they teach that baptism is not merely a symbol but actually conveys [[Divine grace|grace]].

This has fueled much debate within Methodism over the purpose of infant baptism, though most agree it should be continued.  Wesley and the Methodists would agree with the [[Reformed]] or [[Presbyterian]] denominations that infant baptism is symbolic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nInfant baptism is particularly illustrative of the Methodist doctrine of [[prevenient grace]]. The principle is that [[The Fall of Man]] ruined the human soul to such an extent that nobody ''wants'' a relationship with God. In order for humans to even want to be able to choose, God must empower their will (so that they may choose Christ) which he does by means of prevenient grace. Thus God takes the very first step in salvation, preceding any human effort or decision. Methodists justify infant baptism by this principle of prevenient grace, often arguing that infant baptism is God's promise or declaration to the infant that calls that infant to (eventually) believe in God's promises (God's Word) for salvation. When the individual believes in Jesus they will profess their faith before the church, often using a ritual called confirmation in which the Holy Spirit is invoked with the laying on of hands. Methodists also use infant baptism symbolically, as an illustration of God approaching the helpless. They see the ceremony additionally as a celebration of God's prevenient grace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nWesley was an Anglican minister who held to [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminian]] theology, unlike most Anglicans who held to Reformed (Calvinist) theology as taught in the [[39 Articles]].  Augustus Toplady, John Newton, and George Whitefield were all Anglican ministers and Calvinists.  They interpreted the Anglican formularies of the [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html 39 Articles of Religion], the [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/intro/contents.html 1662 Book of Common Prayer], and the [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#35 Second Book of the Anglican Homilies] from a Calvinist perspective and would have been more in agreement with the Reformed churches and the Puritans on the issue of infant baptism.  The [http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/baptism/catchism.html Catechism] in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer shows that baptism was an outward sign of an inward grace.  Prevenient grace, according to the Calvinist Anglicans, referred to unconditional election and irresistible grace, which is necessary for conversion of the elect.  Infants are to be baptised because they are children of believers who stand in surety for them until they \"come of age\" and are bound to the same requirements of repentance and faith as adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed churches ====\n\nPresbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians believe that baptism, whether of infants or adults, is a \"sign and seal of the [[Covenant theology#Covenant of grace|covenant of grace]]\", and that baptism admits the party baptised into the [[visible church]].<ref>Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 28, Section 1.</ref> Being a member of the visible church does not guarantee salvation; though it does provide the child with many benefits, including that of one's particular congregation consenting to assist in the raising of that child in \"the way he should go, (so that) when he is old he will not turn from it\".  Elect infants (those [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] for salvation) who die in infancy are by faith considered regenerate on the basis of God's covenant promises in the covenant of grace.<ref>Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 10, Section 3.</ref>\n\nPresbyterian, Congregational and many Reformed Christians see infant baptism as the [[New Testament]] form of circumcision in the Jewish covenant ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 24:15). Circumcision did not create faith in the 8-day-old Jewish boy. It merely marked him as a member of God's covenant people Israel. Likewise, baptism doesn't create faith; it is a sign of membership in the visible covenant community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/a-brief-defense-of-infant-baptism/|title=A Brief Defense of Infant Baptism|last=DeYoung|first=Kevin|website=The Gospel Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nPresbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians consider children of professing Christians to be members of the visible Church (the covenant community). They also consider them to be full members of the local congregation where their parents are members and members of the universal Church (the set of all true believers who make up the invisible church) unless and until they prove otherwise. Baptism is the mark of membership in the covenant of grace and in the universal church, although regeneration is not inseparably connected with baptism.<ref>Westminster Confession, Chapter 28, Section 1 and especially section 3. Baptised people are considered part of the covenant of grace by faith unless they prove otherwise by committing apostasy.</ref>\n\nThe Unitarian and Free Christian Churches of Great Britain perform Baptisms (Christenings) and consider this to be an important rite of passage.\n\n===Contrasts between infant and adult baptism===\nChristians disagree about infant baptism because they disagree about the nature of faith, the role of baptism, the means of salvation, the nature of grace, and the function of the sacraments.  Pedobaptism and credobaptism are positions which bubble up from theological views at a more fundamental level of one's theological system.\n* If baptism is a sign that a person is a member of God's covenant community, and if the children of believers are members of that community, it follows that the children of believers should receive the sign that they are members of God's covenant community by being baptised, as an infant is entitled to a passport that indicates the child as a member of a particular country.<ref>[[John Calvin|Calvin]] asked: \"If the children of believers are partakers of the covenant without the help of understanding, there is no reason why they should be barred from the sign merely because they cannot swear to the provisions of the covenant\" (Inst. 4, 16, 24, quoted in [http://www.reformedtheology.ca/baptism.html John Calvin: Infant Baptism])</ref>\n* Believers and the children of believers become members of God's covenant community (or church) through baptism.<ref>\"If baptism was demanded of the Jews as a prerequisite of church membership, we may reasonably conclude that the Gentiles were not admitted to the privilege except on the same condition\" ([http://www.pbministries.org/Theology/J.%20B.%20Jeter/baptist_principles_reset/bpr_p1_02.htm Baptism a Condition of Church Membership]).</ref>\n* It is believed by some Christians that in the heart of a baptised child, faith as a gift or grace from God, as distinct from an act by the person, is made present.<ref>\"When an infant is baptised God creates faith in the heart of that infant. This faith cannot yet, of course, be expressed or articulated, yet it is real and present all the same (see e.g., Acts 2:38\u201339; Titus 3:5\u20136; Matt. 18:6; Luke 1:15; 2 Tim. 3:15)\" ([http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2607 The Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206220443/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2607 |date=6 February 2009 }}</ref>\n* It is believed by some Christians that baptism is not merely a symbol and that it has a real effect, conveying [[divine grace]].<ref>\"The Most Holy Trinity gives the baptised sanctifying grace, the grace of justification:\n* Enabling them to believe in God, to hope in him, and to love him through the theological virtues;\n* Giving them the power to live and act under the prompting of the Holy Spirit through the gifts of the Holy Spirit;\n* Allowing them to grow in goodness through the moral virtues\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1268])</ref>\n\n=== Arguments for infant baptism ===\n\nPaedobaptists do not completely agree on the reasons for baptising infants, and offer different reasons in support of the practice. Among the arguments made in support of the practice are:\n\n==== Argument based on parallel with circumcision ====\n\nSome supporters of infant baptism argue that circumcision is the sign of the covenant God made with Abraham and should be received by all the members of his covenant.<ref>Gen. 17:10\u201311</ref> The children of members of Abraham's covenant are themselves members of Abraham's covenant.<ref>Gen 17:7, Dt. 7:9, 30:6, 1Ch 16:15, Psa 103:17, 105:8</ref> Christians are members of Abraham's covenant <ref>Galatians 3:6\u20139 & Galatians 3:26\u201329; Romans 11.17\u201324; Rom. 4:16; Eph. 2:11\u201313; Eph. 3:3\u20136; Rom 2:28\u201329; 1 Peter 2:9; Gal. 6:16; Phil 3:2\u20133.</ref> Therefore, the children of Christians are members of Abraham's covenant.<ref>1 Cor. 7:14; Acts 2:38</ref> Since baptism is the New Testament form of circumcision,<ref>Col. 2:11\u201312</ref> the children of Christians should receive the sign of the covenant by being baptised.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==== Covenant theology ====\n\n[[Presbyterian]], [[Congregational churches|Congregationalists]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Christians base their case for infant baptism on [[Covenant theology]]. [[Covenant theology]] is a broad interpretative framework used to understand the Bible. [[Reformed Baptist]]s are in many ways [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] yet, as their name suggests, adhere to [[Believers Baptism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[Covenant theology]] God makes two basic [[Covenant (religion)|covenants]], or agreements, with humans. The first one, the [[Covenant of works|Covenant of Works]] is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on human obedience and morality. The covenant was made with [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam broke this covenant so God replaced it with a second more durable covenant\u2014the Covenant of Grace. The Covenant of Grace is an agreement that bases man's relationship with God on God's grace and generosity. The Covenant of Works failed because it was based on human performance. The Covenant of Grace is durable because it is based on God's performance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAll the covenants that God makes with humans after the [[The Fall of Man|Fall]], (e.g. with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David) all extend the Covenant of Grace to its logical conclusion in Jesus Christ. In Covenant theology, however, there is a long-standing understanding that the Mosaic Covenant is also a republication of the Covenant of Works, which required obedience to receive its benefits. The underlying Covenant of Grace extends through the whole Old Testament, which suggests that two covenants are in play throughout the history of Israel. Consequently, Covenant theologians see that the Church, or the people of God, existed in the Old Testament. These are the people who placed their faith in Christ in advance, and they are saved in the same way Christians are. Not every Israelite is in the Church (or elect), many exist under the Covenant of Works and its strict unattainable requirements, but not under the Covenant of Grace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[Presbyterian]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] Christians, this theological framework is important to the Biblical case for infant baptism because it provides a reason for thinking there is strong continuity between the Old and New Testaments. It provides a bridge linking the two Testaments together.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nCovenant Theologians claim that the [[New Testament]] book of [[Hebrews]] demonstrates that much of Israel's worship has been replaced by the person and work of Christ. The result is that some important forms of worship in the Old Testament have New Testament equivalents. The Passover festival, for example, was replaced by the Lord's Supper (or Eucharist).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIt is across the bridge of Covenant Theology that the sign of Abraham's covenant, circumcision, walks into the New Testament. The sign of the Covenant changes its external form to reflect new spiritual realities. It was a bloody sign in the Old Testament but because Christ has shed His blood, it has been transformed into a bloodless sign, i.e. washing with water. Passover was a bloody form of Old Testament worship and also transitions into the New Testament in the bloodless form of bread and wine.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nCovenant theologians point out that the external sign of the covenant in the Old Testament was circumcision. Circumcision was performed upon the male children of Israelites to signify their external membership in God's people, not as a guarantee of true faith; the Old Testament records many Israelites who turned from God and were punished, showing that their hearts were not truly set on serving God. So while all male Israelites had the sign of the covenant performed on them in a once off ceremony soon after birth, such a signifier was external only and not a true indicator of whether or not they would later exhibit true faith in Yahweh.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn the New Testament, circumcision is no longer seen as mandatory for God's people. However, there is compelling{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} evidence to suggest that the Old Testament circumcision rite has been replaced by baptism. For instance: \"In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, buried with Him in baptism.\" (Colossians 2:11\u201312a){{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nSome paedobaptists, then, think the analogy of baptism to circumcision correctly points to children, since the historic Israelite application of circumcision was to infants, not to adult converts, of which there were few. Covenant theology, then, identifies baptism less as a statement of faith than as an assumption of identity; that is to say that infant baptism is a sign of covenantal inclusion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeYoung |first1=Kevin |title=A Brief Defense of Infant Baptism |url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevin-deyoung/a-brief-defense-of-infant-baptism/ |website=www.thegospelcoalition.org |accessdate=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Corroborating evidence ====\n\nPaedobaptists point to a number of passages in the New Testament which seem to corroborate the above argument.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Household baptisms =====\n\nIn the Old Testament, if the head of a household converted to Judaism, all the males in the house, even the infants, were circumcised. Some paedobaptists argue this pattern continues into the New Testament. Reference is made, for example, to baptising a person ''and their whole household''\u2014the households of [[Lydia (name)|Lydia]], [[Crispus]], and Stephanas are mentioned by name [http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?acts+16:14-15;18:8;1cor+1:16 Acts 16:14\u201315, 18:8; 1 Cor 1:16].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nPaedobaptists challenge credobaptists on this point: Why would a whole household be baptised just because the head of the house had faith? Shouldn't they baptise each member of the family as they come to individual faith? Household baptism implies that the rules for membership in Abraham's covenant have continued into the New Testament, the main difference is the sign of the covenant.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nCredobaptists counter with verses such as John 4:53, Acts 16:34 and Acts 18:8 in which entire households are said to have \"believed\". As such, the paedobaptist assumption is that household baptisms mentioned in the Bible involved infants, presumably incapable of personal belief.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Original sin =====\n\nPaedobaptists also point to [http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?psalm+51 Psalm 51], which reads, in part, \"surely I was sinful from birth\", as indication that infants are sinful (''vid.'' [[original sin]]) and are thus in need of forgiveness that they too might have salvation.\n\nCredobaptists agree that infants are in need of salvation, but paedobaptists push the point a step further arguing that it makes no theological sense for infants to need salvation but for God to make no provision for them to be saved (See 1 Cor 7:14 where Paul says that the children of a believer are holy\u2014separated\u2014and therefore, perhaps, would not need baptising even if baptism saved). Credobaptists recant that there is a provision through which God enables infants to be saved, belief on Jesus Christ (See Mark 9:42, John 3:14-21, John 11:25-26, Acts 2:21, Romans 10:1-21). Furthermore, credobaptists argue that paedobaptism is affirming believer's hereditary grace, a doctrine not found in scripture. Some credobaptists who agree to the Psalm 51 interpretation, argue that even though infants are sinful they are not accountable, because of the \"age of accountability\". Although many theologians would argue that an \"age of accountability\" is nowhere mentioned in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAn alternative viewpoint of some credobaptists is that since all Christians are predestined to salvation (John 15:16, 1 Cor.1:27, Eph.1:4, 1 Pt.2:4), God will not allow his elect to die before receiving their need, even if they are in old age (Luke 2:25\u201335), an argument whose relation to baptism whether of infants or adults is unclear, unless it means that infants who die without coming to explicit belief and baptism are not among God's elect.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAnother Credobaptist position is called predispositionalism. This suggests that baptism is only a mature response to eternal life, and that infants generate their inner response to God's presence, i.e. those who warm to him would, if dying in infancy, be with him eternally; contra-wise those who chilled to him.  This aligns to the idea of individual faith/welcome (Jhn.1:14).  Its point of determinism predates the age of evangelism, which it holds is still valid in crystallizing predisposition into maturing faith in this life. It considers shades of meaning in the keyword salvation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Words of Jesus =====\n\nIn John 3:5, [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] says, \"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,\"<ref>John 3:5 (KJV)</ref> which, according to some religious groups, means that an infant who dies without being baptized cannot enter heaven and may go to [[limbo]] instead.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===== Peter's speech =====\nAccording to the [[Book of Acts]], \"Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptised, ''every one of you'', in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you '''and your children''' and for all who are far off\u2014for all whom the Lord our God will call.'\" (Acts 2:38\u201339, NIV\u2013UK, emphasis added)<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|2:38\u201339|NIVUK}}</ref> The [[United Methodist Church]] argues that the phrase \"every one of you\" recalls the use of the same phrase in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|29:10\u201312}}, where there is explicit mention of the \"little ones\" present; and it takes the phrase \"and your children\" to mean that Peter included children in the covenant community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.covingtonfumc.com/BaptismintheUnitedMethodistChurch360166|title=Baptism in the United Methodist Church|website=www.covingtonfumc.com}}</ref>\n\nCredobaptists counter that only those who believe, and children who believe are recipients of the promise. Otherwise, all children of Adam would be saved.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===== Early Christian practice =====\n\nSeveral early [[Church Fathers]] seem to have taught that infant baptism is proper; [[Origen]] states that the practice of baptising infants is of apostolic origin.<ref>\"The Church received from the apostles the tradition of giving baptism even to infants\" (Commentaries on Romans 5:9, quoted, for instance, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=l62q-d4Wi20C&pg=PA208&dq=Jurgens+%22even+to+infants%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y1ujUfqiHIWc9gT9nYG4CA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Jurgens%20%22even%20to%20infants%22&f=false W.

(Luke 3:3, Mark 1:4, Acts 13:24, Acts 19:4){{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n*There are no instances of infant baptism in the scripture<ref name=\"desiringgod.org\"/>\n\nSome opponents{{Who|date=December 2018}} of paedobaptism point out that Jesus himself was baptised at the age of 30.\nThey also point to the two (out of five) [[Great Commission]] passages that speak of baptism. They see {{bibleverse||Matthew|28:18\u201320}} as giving exclusive instructions about who is to be baptised: \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you\" (verses 19\u201320, NKJV). They interpret this as referring to three successive stages, with baptism following on becoming a disciple (which is beyond the power of an infant), and instruction following on baptism, not preceding it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe {{bibleverse||Mark|16:15\u201318}} Great Commission passage speaks of believing: \"He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned\" (verse 16, NKJV). This, they say, excludes infants, whom they see as incapable of believing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\nIf pedobaptists accept this text as canonical, they can still point out that the second clause mentions believing, but not baptism. Therefore, one could be baptised and still not be a believer. They argue that this may not exclude infant baptism, but rather corroborate it, since it indicates that one baptised as an infant who rejects the faith is not saved against their will. Pedobaptists who accept this passage may also point out that although belief and baptism are both mentioned, there is no order implied. In return, opposers declare that baptism is for those who already believe and are able to state their belief, which infants cannot do. In Peter's address to adults, \"Repent and be baptised\" {{bibleverse||Acts|2:38}}, they see repentance as a prerequisite, and this requires a mature understanding of sin and a decision to turn away from sin. However, St. Peter was speaking to those who were already adults, not to infants. Pedobaptists claim that it would follow that his instructions are meant for adults and not for infants. Indeed, adult candidates for baptism are required by most branches that practice pedobaptism to make a confession of faith before baptism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Some{{who|date=December 2018}} point to {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:16}} or {{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:21}} as evidence that each individual must make a mature decision regarding baptism.

During the Reformation, Anabaptists were persecuted by Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican and Catholic regimes. The English government imposed restrictions on Baptists in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] during the 17th century. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] repressed Baptists prior to the [[1917 revolution]], and sought restrictions on Baptists and Pentecostals after being re-established after the fall of Communism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nB.R. White describes the motivations behind persecution of the Anabaptists during the Reformation as follows:\n<blockquote>\nOther Christians saw the baptism of each new-born baby into the secular parish community and close links between church and state as the divinely-ordained means of holding society together. Hence many other Christians saw the Anabaptists as subversive of all order. Consequently, from the earliest days, they were sharply persecuted and leaders were soon executed.<ref>Eerdman's Handbook to Christian Belief, William B. Eerdman's Publishing Company, 1982.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNote: [[Christian Scientists]], [[Quakers]], the [[Salvation Army]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarians]] cannot be classified as specifically opposing ''infant'' baptism, since they generally do not observe baptism in any form.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) completely rejects infant baptism.<ref name=\"EoM Infant Baptism\"/> Little children are considered both [[Original sin#Latter-day Saints|born without sin]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= Merrill |first= Byron R. |contribution= Original sin |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4025 |pages= 1052\u20131053 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

In the [[Latin Rite|Latin-Rite]] (i.e. Western) Catholic Church, the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] is to be conferred at about the age of discretion (generally taken to be about 7), unless the [[Episcopal Conference]] has decided on a different age, or there is danger of death or, in the judgement of the minister, a grave reason suggests otherwise ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060718135812/http://www.deacons.net/Canon_Law/book_4.htm canon 891 of the Code of Canon Law]). The renewal of baptismal promises by those receiving the sacrament in the Western Catholic Church is incidental to the rite and not essentially different from the solemn renewal of their baptismal promises that is asked of all members of this Church each year at the [[Easter Vigil]] service. Only in French-speaking countries has there been a development of ceremonies, quite distinct from the sacrament of Confirmation, for young Catholics to profess their faith publicly, in line with their age.<ref>cf.

The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto's rotation period, which was previously known from Pluto's [[light curve]]. This indicated a [[synchronous orbit]], which strongly suggested that the bulge effect was real and not spurious.

It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit about each other. The collision would have been violent enough to boil off volatile ices like [[methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) but not violent enough to have destroyed either body.

The two objects are [[tidal locking|gravitationally locked]] to one another, so each keeps the same face towards the other. This is a case of mutual tidal locking, as compared to that of the Earth and the Moon, where the Moon always shows the same face to Earth, but not vice versa. The average distance between Charon and Pluto is {{convert|19570|km}}. The discovery of Charon allowed astronomers to calculate accurately the mass of the Plutonian system, and mutual [[occultation]]s revealed their sizes. However, neither indicated the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto's outer moons in late 2005. Details in the orbits of the outer moons revealed that Charon has approximately 12% of the mass of Pluto.<ref name=\"Buie_2006\" />{{Clear}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n{{main|Geology of Charon}}\n{{see also|List of geological features on Charon}}\n\n[[File:Charon, Earth & Moon size comparison.jpg|thumbnail|right|Size comparisons: [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and Charon]]\nCharon's diameter is {{convert|1212|km}}, just over half that of Pluto.<ref name=\"Stern_2015\" /><ref name=\"Stern_2017\" /> Larger than the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], it is the twelfth largest [[natural satellite]] in the [[Solar System]].

The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto's rotation period, which was previously known from Pluto's [[light curve]]. This indicated a [[synchronous orbit]], which strongly suggested that the bulge effect was real and not spurious. This resulted in reassessments of Pluto's size, mass, and other physical characteristics because the calculated mass and [[albedo]] of the Pluto\u2013Charon system had previously been attributed to Pluto alone.\n\nDoubts about Charon's existence were erased when it and Pluto entered a [[Solar eclipses on Pluto|five-year period of mutual eclipses and transits]] between 1985 and 1990. This occurs when the Pluto\u2013Charon [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] is edge-on as seen from Earth, which only happens at two intervals in Pluto's 248-year orbital period.

In this model, a large [[Kuiper belt]] object struck Pluto at high velocity, destroying itself and blasting off much of Pluto's outer [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], and Charon coalesced from the debris.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Giant Impact Origin of Pluto\u2013Charon |last=Canup |first=Robin |journal=Science |date=January 28, 2005 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/307/5709/546|doi=10.1126/science.1106818 |bibcode=2005Sci...307..546C |pmid=15681378 |volume=307 |issue=5709 |pages=546\u201350}}</ref> However, such an impact should result in an icier Charon and rockier Pluto than scientists have found. It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit about each other. The collision would have been violent enough to boil off volatile ices like [[methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) but not violent enough to have destroyed either body. The very similar density of Pluto and Charon implies that the parent bodies were not fully differentiated when the impact occurred.<ref name=\"Stern_2015\"/>\n\n==Orbit==\n[[File:Pluto-Charon system-new.gif|thumb|left|A simulated view of the Pluto\u2013Charon system showing that Pluto orbits a point outside itself.

The two objects are [[tidal locking|gravitationally locked]] to one another, so each keeps the same face towards the other. This is a case of mutual tidal locking, as compared to that of the Earth and the Moon, where the Moon always shows the same face to Earth, but not vice versa. The average distance between Charon and Pluto is {{convert|19570|km}}. The discovery of Charon allowed astronomers to calculate accurately the mass of the Plutonian system, and mutual [[occultation]]s revealed their sizes. However, neither indicated the two bodies' individual masses, which could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto's outer moons in late 2005. Details in the orbits of the outer moons revealed that Charon has approximately 12% of the mass of Pluto.<ref name=\"Buie_2006\" />{{Clear}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n{{main|Geology of Charon}}\n{{see also|List of geological features on Charon}}\n\n[[File:Charon, Earth & Moon size comparison.jpg|thumbnail|right|Size comparisons: [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and Charon]]\nCharon's diameter is {{convert|1212|km}}, just over half that of Pluto.<ref name=\"Stern_2015\" /><ref name=\"Stern_2017\" /> Larger than the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], it is the twelfth largest [[natural satellite]] in the [[Solar System]]. Charon's slow rotation means that there should be little flattening or tidal distortion, if Charon is sufficiently massive to be [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. Any deviation from a perfect sphere is too small to have been detected by observations by the ''New Horizons'' mission. This is in contrast to [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], a Saturnian moon of a similar size to Charon but a pronounced fossil oblateness from early in its history. The lack of such fossil oblateness in Charon could mean that it is currently in hydrostatic equilibrium, or simply that its orbit approached its current one early in its history, when it was still warm.<ref name=\"Nimmo2017\"/>\n\nBased on mass updates from observations made by <i>New Horizons</i><ref name=\"Stern_2017\" /> the mass ratio of Charon to Pluto is 0.1218:1. This is much larger than the Moon to the Earth: 0.0123:1. Because of the high mass ratio, the [[barycenter]] is outside of the radius of Pluto, and the Pluto-Charon system has been referred to as a dwarf [[double planet]].

The difference is considerably lower than that of most suspected collisional satellites.

The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series.

The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/illustration-tom-hovey |title=Illustration: We interview the artist behind the Great British Bake Off, Tom Hovey|author= Liv Siddall |date=1 November 2013 |work=It's Nice That }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomhovey.co.uk/the-great-british-bake-off/ |title=Tom Hovey }}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver;\"|Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\"  |Average UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10379873/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-moves-to-BBC1.html |title=The Great British Bake Off moves to BBC1 |author=Rachel Moss|date= 15 October 2013|work=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref name=\"broadcast\">{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/bbc1-rises-to-the-challenge/5082034.article |title=BBC1 rises to the challenge|date=22 January 2015 |author= Stephen Price |work=Broadcast }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeslot\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 17 August 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 21 September 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Edd Kimber]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miranda Gore Browne\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2.77\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Tuesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"8\"| [[BBC Two]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruth Clemens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|2]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 4 October 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Joanne Wheatley]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Holly Bell\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 4.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mary-Anne Boermans\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)|3]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 16 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[John Whaite]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brendan Lynch\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 5.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[James Morton (baker)|James Morton]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 20 August 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 22 October 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Frances Quinn]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kimberley Wilson\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 7.35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Ruby Tandoh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 6 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 8 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nancy Birtwhistle]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis Troyano\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.04\n| rowspan=\"6\" | Wednesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"6\" | [[BBC One]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Burr\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 5 August 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 7 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nadiya Hussain]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Cumming\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Tamal Ray]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 7)|7]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 24 August 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 26 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Candice Brown]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Andrew M.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

[[Love Productions]], in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds, attempting to impress a group of judges with their baking skills, with a contestant being eliminated in each round, with the winner being selected from the contestants who reach the finals. The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series. After its seventh series, [[Love Productions]] signed a three-year deal with [[Channel 4]] to produce the series for the broadcaster.<ref name=\"Bake Off Move 2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off/|title=BBC loses Great British Bake Off, as Channel 4 swoops for corporation's biggest show|last=Foster|first=Patrick|date=12 September 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> However, [[BBC Studios]] still owns the global distribution rights to the show, which are set for renewal in 2028.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a807901/bbc-worldwide-still-has-the-international-rights-to-great-british-bake-off-so-there/|title=BBC Worldwide still has the global Bake Off rights|last=Nissim|first=Mayer|date=2016-09-14|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally presented by [[Sue Perkins]] and [[Mel Giedroyc]], with judges [[Mary Berry]] and [[Paul Hollywood]].

The applicants to the show are assessed by a researcher, followed by an audition in London with two of their bakes. They then undergo a screen test and an interview with a producer. A second audition involves the applicants baking two recipes for the judges in front of the cameras.<ref name=\"telegraph 2012\" /> Ten contestants were chosen for the first series, twelve for the following two series, thirteen for the fourth and tenth,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/20/meet-the-2019-great-british-bake-off-contestants-from-the-teacher-to-the-terminator |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2019}}</ref> and twelve from series five to series nine.\n\nIn each episode, the amateur bakers are given three challenges based on that week's theme: a signature bake, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper.<ref name=\"telegraph 2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9411189/Behind-the-scenes-at-the-Great-British-Bake-Off.html |title=Behind the scenes at the Great British Bake-Off |author=Sarah Stephens |date= 14 August 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref> The three challenges take place over two days, and the filming takes up to 16 hours a day. The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/illustration-tom-hovey |title=Illustration: We interview the artist behind the Great British Bake Off, Tom Hovey|author= Liv Siddall |date=1 November 2013 |work=It's Nice That }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomhovey.co.uk/the-great-british-bake-off/ |title=Tom Hovey }}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver;\"|Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\"  |Average UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10379873/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-moves-to-BBC1.html |title=The Great British Bake Off moves to BBC1 |author=Rachel Moss|date= 15 October 2013|work=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref name=\"broadcast\">{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/bbc1-rises-to-the-challenge/5082034.article |title=BBC1 rises to the challenge|date=22 January 2015 |author= Stephen Price |work=Broadcast }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeslot\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 17 August 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 21 September 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Edd Kimber]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miranda Gore Browne\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2.77\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Tuesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"8\"| [[BBC Two]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruth Clemens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|2]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 4 October 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Joanne Wheatley]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Holly Bell\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 4.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mary-Anne Boermans\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)|3]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 16 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[John Whaite]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brendan Lynch\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 5.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[James Morton (baker)|James Morton]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 20 August 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 22 October 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Frances Quinn]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kimberley Wilson\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 7.35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Ruby Tandoh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 6 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 8 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nancy Birtwhistle]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis Troyano\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.04\n| rowspan=\"6\" | Wednesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"6\" | [[BBC One]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Burr\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 5 August 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 7 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nadiya Hussain]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Cumming\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Tamal Ray]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 7)|7]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 24 August 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 26 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Candice Brown]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Andrew M.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

It is equivalent to the [[Navy|naval]] rank of [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] in the other [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]. Although lieutenant commanders are considered junior officers by their respective services (Navy and Coast Guard), the rank of major is that of a senior officer in the United States Army, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Air Force.\n\nThe [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grade]] for the rank of major is O-4. The insignia for the rank consists of a golden [[oak]] leaf, with slight stylized differences between the Army/Air Force version and the Marine Corps version. Promotion to major is governed by the Department of Defense policies derived from the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]] of 1980.\n\n== Army ==\nA major in the U.S. Army typically serves as a [[battalion]] [[executive officer]] (XO) or as the battalion [[Operations (military staff)|operations officer]] (S3).

A regiment consisted of 8 companies with three officers (a captain, a lieutenant and ensign) and about 60 enlisted men each.

It is equivalent to the [[Navy|naval]] rank of [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] in the other [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]].

The news program used a touch-screen television called \"Aksyon Board.\" It is the first local newscast to report via Live-Pack in contrast to the [[Outside broadcasting|OB Vans]] used by its competitors. There is also a round-up news update called Aksyon Ngayon anchored by Dindo Flora, Cristina Lazo, and former [[DWRR-FM|Tambayan 101.9 (now MOR 101.9)]] DJ Reggie Valdez.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, [[Erwin Tulfo]] of the police-report-and-public-service-segment Aksyon Metro joined the newscast and their time slot was moved to 6:00 PM, then 5:45 PM, and then 5:30 PM serving as a former lead-in to the network's former variety shows ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie/Wil Time Bigtime]]''. On that same day, the newscast also introduced a new [[augmented virtuality]] set and OBB. Since November 8, 2010, the newscast began its simulcast on the newly launched [[DWFM|Radyo5 92.3 News FM]].\n\n<!-- Bediones was absent on his fixed last day on Aksyon - February 18. -->\nOn February 17, 2011, [[Paolo Bediones]] left the newscast for ''Aksyon JournalisMO'', leaving Cosim and Tulfo as the main anchors, with Shawn Yao (showbiz and weather) and Makata Tawanan (Makata's Super Bidyo) as segment anchors. The newscast was also given new weekday graphics and new virtual background while starting its simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] on February 21, 2011.\n\nOn June 6, 2011, the newscast added a news desk while updating their graphics and title card. \"Makata's Super Bidyo,\" a video features segment, was reformatted with its new name \"Makatang Gala\" (The Stray Poet), where Makata Tawanan goes on streets to bring information to its viewers. By July 25, 2011, [[Lourd de Veyra]] joined the newscast, hosting his weather-and-trivia-segment \"Weather or Not\", which includes relevant and historical bites after de Veyra presents the weather.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Aksyon divided into two parts, Metro Aksyon focused on police reports around Metro Manila, and Rodolfo Jun Sabayton hosted \"Anong Problema Mo\", while remaining 30 minutes is the national and other news. It then became an emergency protocol when its former lead-in public service program, ''[[T3: Alliance|T3: Kapatid, Sagot Kita]]'', of the Tulfo brothers was given a long-term suspension by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] following numerous controversies that hounded the show. By February 20, 2012, Aksyon modified its newsdesk and updating its graphics and title card.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Aksyon reexpand its time to 45 minutes, from 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM. It then launched a new segment entitled ''Happy News'', a segment that focuses on light-hearted topics (e.g., travel, food, festivals, etc.) that reflects the Filipino's happy spirit. It has become the newscast's closing segment since its launch.\n\nOn June 2013, when [[Sports5]] did not renew a blocktime agreement with [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] to air the [[AKTV]] sports block due to high blocktime costs and low ratings, the newscast's simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] was limited to give way for the primetime sports programming on AksyonTV.\n\nOn October 14, 2013, along with the launch of News5's primetime block '''KBO: Karunungan, Balita, Opinyon''', Aksyon updated its newsdesk, graphics and title card. later, Aksyon became a 1-hour newscast from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nOn December 23, 2013, Aksyon, along with other [[News5]] programs, transferred from its former TV5 Studio Complex in Novaliches, Quezon City to a larger [[TV5 Media Center]] in Reliance, [[Mandaluyong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n5e.interaksyon.com/top/4EA1A901A12646E/1001/bagong-tahanan-ng-tv5-sa-mandaluyong-silipin|title= Bagong Tahanan ng TV5 sa Mandaluyong, Silipin|publisher=News5 Everywhere|accessdate= 21 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 2014, the newscast has two new segments. Caught in Aksyon focuses on issues \u2013 accidents, violation, and wrongful activities caught on CCTV Cameras. ''Makatarugan Ba?'' is about the issues that one or more individuals has a violations in a law, as explained by Atty. Mel Sta. Maria.\n\n=== Expansion (2014\u20132017) ===\n\nOn July 21, 2014, \"Aksyon\" expanded its newscast by revamping four separate newscasts: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' (replacing [[Good Morning Club]]), ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' (the reincarnation of [[Balitaang Tapat]]) back-to-back with T3 Enforced (after moving to noontime slot), the reformatted flagship ''Aksyon Prime'', and ''Aksyon Tonite'' (replacing [[Pilipinas News]] due to manpolling of its anchors like Cherie Mercado and Jove Francisco).\n\nOn October 21, 2014, ''Aksyon Prime'' cut its runtime to 45 minutes whenever [[2014\u201315 PBA season|PBA]] [[PBA on Sports5|games]] are at hand on weeknights. ''Reaksyon'' once again had a separate program after ''Aksyon Tonite''.\n\nOn November 3, 2014, Veteran [[war correspondent]] and [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] multimedia director Ed Lingao joins ''Aksyon Tonite'', replacing [[Paolo Bediones]], which left the newscast as effect of a video scandal while he was on [[GMA Network]]. Ed Lingao is previously with ABC/TV5 from 2004 \u2013 2009 as Head of News and as Contributor on Aksyon's predecessor, [[TEN: The Evening News]]. Ed Lingao's appearance was on a split screen, with Cheryl Cosim presenting from the studio while he is at the scene of the news on location. Andanar became also a temporary co-anchor with Cosim in ''Aksyon Tonite''. But during the coverage of [[Tropical Storm Fung-wong (2014)|Typhoon Mario (Fung-wong)]], Bediones, while being on a leave of absence, had an appearance on ''Aksyon Tonite'' and other ''Aksyon'' newscasts to give a report for Rescue5.\n\nPaolo Bediones joined ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' for a short period of time then later removed. However, the public service reminders from Rescue5 with Paolo Bediones were still being aired until his quiet unknown status with the network.\n\nOn January 2015, ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' shortened its airing time until 6:30 AM as the network expands its [[List of programs broadcast by The 5 Network#Cartoons|TV5 Kids]] block.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts including Aksyon News Alerts made history as they shifted to 16:9 high definition production, the first among the top three networks in the country. However, as major networks are initially testing digital terrestrial broadcasts at the time being, these newscasts are aired to viewers in a downgraded 4:3 standard definition letterbox (either on widescreen or CRT TVs).\n\nOn June 2015, all Aksyon Newscasts updated their graphic packages in full 16:9 presentation, which is currently used by major television networks in the US, Australia, most of Europe and other countries. The studio set was also renovated and expanded to accommodate an LED screen at the back of the studio with a desk for the anchor. This also the first time that ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' doesn't have a separate studio set.\n\nOn July 20, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts rescaled their graphics to allow TV5 to fit the newscast to the conventional 4:3 broadcast format. However, the letterboxing output shall remain to be used for some circumstances (such as events like the SONA where the originating source only applies to 16:9 widescreen TVs).\n\nAfter Shawn Yao's controversy on one of her live reports on TV and before anchoring a program on [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]], she left her segment in Aksyon and replaced permanently by MJ Marfori.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, Tulfo replaced Lourd de Veyra as one of the anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' Erwin and Martin's tandem in early morning television show made a return after ''Good Morning Sir''; their radio program ''Punto Asintado'' became a segment again in ''Aksyon Sa Umaga''. Erwin Tulfo is still one of the anchors of ''Aksyon Prime.''\n\nOn February 15, 2016, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' introduced ''Balitaserye,'' a five-minute crime investigation segments, anchored by Gary de Leon.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Cheryl Cosim and TV5's resident legal analyst Atty. Mel Sta. Maria replaced Martin Andanar and Erwin Tulfo as anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' This is Cheryl Cosim's return as a morning anchor/host after ''Good Morning Club'', though she still anchored ''Aksyon Tonite'' at that time''.'' This is also Atty. Mel Sta. Maria's first time to become a main anchor of a television newscast. Public service format was added on his arrival. Before this, he already became part of a segment in some newscasts of News5 where he gave similar advice to that which he gave on his radio program ''Relasyon.''\n\nOn April 2016, after many years of anchoring various newscasts, this is the first time that Martin Andanar doesn't have any television-produced programs except the continuous rerun of ''Crime Klasik'' and as host of ''Punto Asintado'' from Radyo5. He then focused on his radio and podcast career, while continuing his job as the official voice over of all News5 platforms: Radyo5, AksyonTV (except [[Sports5]] programs), N5E, and News5 programs on TV5. But on June 2016, it was revealed that Martin Andanar was appointed as the new head of [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)|PCOO]] (Presidential Communication Operations Office) under the Duterte Administration, which supervises the government's media infrastructure.\n\nOn May 2016, after the Bilang Pilipino 2016 Election Coverage, all Aksyon newscasts continued to utilize the new studio with a large LED. Unlike ABS-CBN News and GMA News who came back in their respective newscast studios after the coverage, News5 considered the Election studio as their new studio for all of its editions. However, 4:3 graphics, title cards, and OBB didn't change.

Cheryl Cosim retained her role to the morning newscast, but she left her co-presenter of ''Aksyon Tonite'' Ed Lingao who went solo for a week until Roices Naguit took over Cosim's vacated anchor's chair on the Late Night Edition in the height of the network's coverage to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The move was made after News5 axed Balita Alas Singko on weekdays which ended on November 30. However, the Saturday and Sunday editions of Balita Alas Singko still continues to air because it occupies both on Radyo5 and AksyonTV and considering to be the only news content of News5 on weekends. However, it cannot be seen on TV5 because of its radio booth format with no field reporters and video reports\n\nBy December 19, 2016, the newscast's graphic package gained rounded edges (in exception in the flipper) with orange as the standard color. It was initially used in the morning and early evening editions before implementing on the rest of the newscast. The color is now similar with their [[Cignal]] business channel [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]].\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Aksyon Prime extended its runtime every Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays to 75 minutes, with Aksyon sa Tanghali extending its runtime to a full hour seven days before the main edition. However, Aksyon Prime was scaled back to 60 minutes by February 23.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Erwin Tulfo and News5 management reached an agreement for the former to left Aksyon Prime, leaving his radio program Punto Asintado the remaining News5 program he hosted on, as well as occasional appearances with his brother [[Ben Tulfo]] for ''[[Kilos Pronto]]'' (a blocktime public-service show produced by ''Bitag Media'' for government-owned [[People's Television Network|PTV]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/first-on-mnp-erwin-tulfo-officially-out.html|title=First on MNP: Erwin Tulfo officially out as co-anchor of 'Aksyon'|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/tv5-president-and-ceo-chot-reyes-talks.html|title=TV5 President and CEO Chot Reyes talks about Erwin Tulfo's departure from 'Aksyon'|last=|first=|date=April 20, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref> Although personal concerns were the main reason for his departure to the newscast, several rumors have surrounded that it was due to his [[Duterte Diehard Supporters|strong opinion stance leaning towards]] President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], which was deemed sensitive to tackle for most Filipinos, particularly to members of the media (such as criticizing anti-Duterte supporter [[Jim Paredes]] on the DDS rally in Luneta during the 31st anniversary of [[People Power Revolution|EDSA I]] and Ed Lingao's criticisms to his opinion about opposition Sen.

As a compromise for the latter, however, News5 offered a separate online streaming on News5 Everywhere and News5's Facebook Live, where it can continue to run beyond its television broadcast. The said extension was discontinued months later.\n\n=== Reformat and major changes made by ESPN5's launch (2017\u2013present) ===\n\nNew soundtrack, openers, title cards and transition graphics (except Aksyon sa Umaga) were refreshed across all editions by August 14, 2017, replacing its 2014 version. The morning edition also replaced the AksyonTV theme with the new Aksyon soundtrack.\n\nOn September 4, 2017, Aksyon sa Umaga reduced its airtime from 75 minutes to 60 minutes to give way to some programming changes within the network.\n\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced its partnership agreement between the network and US-based sports television network [[ESPN]], who returned to Philippine television after a 5-year long hiatus. Thus the former Sports5 rebranded as ESPN5 a day after, during the coverage of Game 1 of the 2017 PBA Governor's Cup Finals between the [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel]] and the [[Meralco Bolts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE - TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|last=Bolante|first=Mikkel|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=Interaksyon}}</ref> The new sports deal showed drastic changes within News5 and Aksyon: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' was axed for good on November 3 to give way for the upcoming ESPN US' primetime programming simulcast overnight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/10/tv5-canceling-aksyon-sa-umaga-to-make-way-for-espn.html|title=TV5 canceling 'Aksyon sa Umaga' to make way for ESPN programs|last=|first=|date=October 20, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> This ended Cheryl Cosim's role as the main anchor of a News5 newscast after 7 years, although she continues radio duties at Radyo5 as well as filling-in for Cruz-Valdes on the primetime edition.

Ed Lingao and Cheryl Cosim temporarily replaced Luchi Cruz-Valdes in the newscast. Cosim served as the main anchor of the primetime edition from its inception In 2010 until 2014. While Lingao is on the primetime edition, News5 correspondent Maricel Halili took Lingao's post as sit-in anchor for Aksyon Tonite.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, the newscast had a minor change on their studio set-up and a newsdesk, which was previously used by now-defunct News5 program ''[[Reaksyon]]''. The newscast also shares its set with ''[[SportsCenter Philippines]]'' of ESPN5 and ''The Big Story'' of [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]] (before it was moved to newly launched [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] studio as the newscast was relaunched in the news channel). Aksyon Tonite also moved its timeslot at 11:00 PM to also give way to the said sports newscast. The said edition also re-extended its broadcast by 15 minutes.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Aksyon Prime reduced airtime by 15 minutes on a PBA game day. This is due to adjustment of the PBA broadcast schedule which starts at 4:30 PM, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The runtime remains the same for the non-PBA game days.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the noontime and primetime edition began airing on weekday mornings at 5:00 AM as a replay telecast, serving as the morning timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga.\n\nDuring the third week of April, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' was given a Strong Parental Guidance (SPG) rating by the MTRCB due to its public service segments profane nature. The rating also includes the news segments of the said edition.\n\nOn July 2, 2018, after her almost 7 months of absence, ''Aksyon Prime'' main anchor Luchi Cruz-Valdes returns in the newscast, joining Ed Lingao, who serves as one of the sit-in presenters while she was on her leave. Meanwhile, another sit-in anchor Cheryl Cosim made a comeback to ''Aksyon Tonite'' as main anchor. Cosim permanently replaced Lingao, who also been her former co-anchor in the late-night edition.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, upon the rebranding of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], ''Aksyon Prime''<nowiki/>'s simulcast on the channel was axed to give way to the channel's repositioning as an all-sports channel. However, the audio simulcast on Radyo5 remains intact, with added TV presence on a standalone Cignal channel of the same name, which is also aired on selected UHF free TV stations run by the radio station's owner, [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. \n\nOn February 11, 2019, Aksyon Tonite moved its timeslot at 10:30 PM, to give way for the special program as part of News5's coverage of the 2019 mid-term elections, ''Aplikante sa Senado''.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, Aksyon Primetime began simulcasting on '''One PH''', a \"teleradyo\" channel of Radyo5, on Cignal TV channel 6. Four days later, News5 announced that Aksyon Tonite will be replaced by a rebroadcast of ''[[The Big Story (TV program)|The Big Story]]'', the flagship newscast of 5's sister English news channel [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] starting March 4.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' began airing a replay once again at 6:15 AM every weekday morning. It serves as a replacement for the timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga and the ''Kids on 5'' block. The replay once again ended after a month. It was replaced by a simulcast of [[DWFM|Radyo5]]'s Morning Calls.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' re-extends its broadcast to 60 minutes during non-PBA game days. In accordance with the changes, ''Aksyon'' airs at 6:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Its PBA game day timeslot remains unchanged. These changes were brought about by 5's expansion of its news content through programs from sister station [[One PH]]; like its newscast service [[One Balita|''One Balita'']] and late night talk show [[Radyo5 92.3 News FM|''Wag Po!'']]. Weeks prior to the change, Aksyon Prime had already reintroduced their online-only extension on ''News5 Always On''. Although, it is only aired on an occasional basis.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, ''Aksyon Prime'' was permanently moved to 6:30 PM five nights a week. This change happened days before the start of PBA's 45th season, which prompts Aksyon to start at 6:30 PM every Wednesday and Friday. Thus, it also allowed 5 to air an extended afternoon entertainment block on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, both editions of ''Aksyon'' were placed on hiatus to give way to the simulcast of [[One News (TV channel)|One News]] Now's special coverage on the Luzon quarantine due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n== Newscast editions ==\n\n===Aksyon (Primetime Edition)===\n\n==== Start time differences ====\nThe primetime edition is promoted to air at 6:30 PM on weeknights, with some exceptions. In almost every PBA game day, the newscast would start at or after 6:30 PM on 5 to allow the afternoon PBA game to end with the final score of the match. Start time is also subjected to change outside PBA games, only if necessary.\n\n====Main presenters====\n* [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]] (2014\u2013present)\n* Ed Lingao (2017\u2013present)\n\n====Segment presenters====\n* [[Lourd de Veyra]] (2011\u2013present, ''Aksyon Weather'' and ''Word of the Lourd'')\n* MJ Marfori (2014\u2013present, ''Celebrity Aksyon'')\n* Lyn Olavario (2018\u2013present, ''SportsCenter sa Aksyon'')\n\n====Former main presenters====\n* [[Paolo Bediones]] (2010\u20132011)\n* [[Erwin Tulfo]] (2010\u20132017; moved to [[People's Television Network|PTV-4]], and [[Radyo Pilipinas]])\n* [[Cheryl Cosim]] (2010\u20132014; 2017\u20132018; now hosting One Balita Pilipinas for sister service Radyo5/One PH; substitute anchor for Luchi Cruz-Valdes)\n\n====Former segment presenters====\n* Paloma (2010\u20132011, ''Showbiz Aksyon'') \n* Shawn Yao (2011\u20132014, ''Showbiz Aksyon''; currently on [[One News (Philippines)|One News]])\n* Atty.

This edition always changes the schedule since the launch, due to blocktime programming or competing with other noontime newscasts. In 2018, it holds the reputation of being the only SPG-rated newscast in the country due to its public service format which they are featuring some sensitive complaints, and profanity which cannot be censored in a live program.

Mercado, pregnant when the weekend edition first aired, when she got gave birth to her child, she was replaced by Amelyn Veloso, Naomi Dayrit, and then Maricel Halili, when she was the permanent replacement for Mercado. The weekend edition, along with [[Tutok Tulfo]] was moved to late nights on October 2010 to make way for the pilot episodes of ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie]]''. Being absent on his last five weeks, Andanar was pulled out of the newscast to anchor the late-night newscast ''[[Aksyon JournalisMO]]'' on October 2010.\n\nOn October 2010, Andanar was replaced on Aksyon Weekend by his co-host on the weekday morning program ''[[Sapul sa Singko]]'', Atty. Mike Templo. He joined Halili and Francisco, who remained in the weekend newscast although he was also assigned to the late night newscast. The weekend edition was split into ''Aksyon Sabado'' and ''Aksyon Linggo''.\n\nOn August 5, 2012, Aksyon Sabado/Linggo made its final broadcast to give way to [[Pilipinas News]] weekend edition starting August 11, 2012 until July 13, 2014.\n\nOn January 26, 2013, the weekend edition returned on air. But this time, it is now being anchored by [[Raffy Tulfo]] and [[Grace Lee]]. And it is being aired on Saturdays only because of the weekend edition of Pilipinas News which is aired every Saturday and Sunday around midnight, with Aksyon being aired on Sundays as Aksyon Alert only. Tulfo has a new segment called \"Itimbre Mo, Tol\". The final episode of Aksyon Weekend aired on July 12, 2014, with Raffy Tulfo moving to Aksyon sa Tanghali and Grace Lee being assigned to Aksyon sa Umaga starting July 21, 2014.\n\nThe following week, ''Aksyon Alert'' extended their broadcast to weekends with the bulletin airing every top of the hour in the morning and a number of times in the afternoon and the evening. Later on, it was expanded and now airs every 30 minutes in the morning starting 9:00 am, and still a number of times in the afternoon and the evening, before it was stopped airing on November 4, 2017 but still continues on weekdays.\n\n====Final presenters====\n* [[Raffy Tulfo]] (2013\u20132014; currently as a main anchor for Aksyon sa Tanghali)\n* [[Grace Lee]] (2013\u20132014; moved to ABS-CBN)\n* [[Joseph Ubalde]]\u2020 (2013\u20132014, Aksyon Weather Saturday segment host)\n\n====Former presenters====\n* [[Martin Andanar]] (2010)\n* [[Cherie Mercado]] (2010)\n* [[Jove Francisco]] (2010\u20132012)\n* Maricel Halili (2010\u20132012)\n* Atty.

It currently consists of two editions: its main primetime edition, also known as '''''Aksyon Prime''''', broadcasts from 6:30 to 7:30 pm, [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], and is anchored by [[News5]] head [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]] and chief correspondent Ed Lingao, and its noontime public service and news edition, '''''Aksyon sa Tanghali''''' airs from 12:30 to 1:30 pm, [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], and is anchored by [[Raffy Tulfo]].\n\nAksyon formerly produced a morning newscast ('''Aksyon sa Umaga'''), a late night edition ('''Aksyon Tonite''') and weekend newscast ('''Aksyon Weekend''') as part of its integrated news platform adhering to the principle of 24/7 news monitoring and reporting.\n\nIts primetime edition is simulcast on a \"teleradyo\" basis through [[DWFM|92.3 News FM]] in [[Mega Manila]] and its provincial [[List of 5 (TV channel) TV and radio stations|Radyo5]] stations nationwide and tape-delayed on [[One PH]] weeknights at 8:00 PM.\n\nAll of its editions are aired overseas via [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\nIt is the first-ever Philippine TV program that uses [[closed captioning]] (CC1), but only applies to live studio presentations (except live interviews).\n\n==Background==\nThe newscast is based on News5's slogan \"''Higit sa Balita, Aksyon''\", which literally means \"Beyond the news, Action\".\n\n==History==\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== As a primetime newscast (2010\u20132014) ===\n''Aksyon'' premiered on April 5, 2010 at 9:00 PM with [[Paolo Bediones]] and [[Cheryl Cosim]] as its first anchors. The news program used a touch-screen television called \"Aksyon Board.\" It is the first local newscast to report via Live-Pack in contrast to the [[Outside broadcasting|OB Vans]] used by its competitors. There is also a round-up news update called Aksyon Ngayon anchored by Dindo Flora, Cristina Lazo, and former [[DWRR-FM|Tambayan 101.9 (now MOR 101.9)]] DJ Reggie Valdez.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, [[Erwin Tulfo]] of the police-report-and-public-service-segment Aksyon Metro joined the newscast and their time slot was moved to 6:00 PM, then 5:45 PM, and then 5:30 PM serving as a former lead-in to the network's former variety shows ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie/Wil Time Bigtime]]''. On that same day, the newscast also introduced a new [[augmented virtuality]] set and OBB. Since November 8, 2010, the newscast began its simulcast on the newly launched [[DWFM|Radyo5 92.3 News FM]].\n\n<!-- Bediones was absent on his fixed last day on Aksyon - February 18. -->\nOn February 17, 2011, [[Paolo Bediones]] left the newscast for ''Aksyon JournalisMO'', leaving Cosim and Tulfo as the main anchors, with Shawn Yao (showbiz and weather) and Makata Tawanan (Makata's Super Bidyo) as segment anchors. The newscast was also given new weekday graphics and new virtual background while starting its simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] on February 21, 2011.\n\nOn June 6, 2011, the newscast added a news desk while updating their graphics and title card. \"Makata's Super Bidyo,\" a video features segment, was reformatted with its new name \"Makatang Gala\" (The Stray Poet), where Makata Tawanan goes on streets to bring information to its viewers. By July 25, 2011, [[Lourd de Veyra]] joined the newscast, hosting his weather-and-trivia-segment \"Weather or Not\", which includes relevant and historical bites after de Veyra presents the weather.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Aksyon divided into two parts, Metro Aksyon focused on police reports around Metro Manila, and Rodolfo Jun Sabayton hosted \"Anong Problema Mo\", while remaining 30 minutes is the national and other news. It then became an emergency protocol when its former lead-in public service program, ''[[T3: Alliance|T3: Kapatid, Sagot Kita]]'', of the Tulfo brothers was given a long-term suspension by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] following numerous controversies that hounded the show. By February 20, 2012, Aksyon modified its newsdesk and updating its graphics and title card.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Aksyon reexpand its time to 45 minutes, from 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM. It then launched a new segment entitled ''Happy News'', a segment that focuses on light-hearted topics (e.g., travel, food, festivals, etc.) that reflects the Filipino's happy spirit. It has become the newscast's closing segment since its launch.\n\nOn June 2013, when [[Sports5]] did not renew a blocktime agreement with [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] to air the [[AKTV]] sports block due to high blocktime costs and low ratings, the newscast's simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] was limited to give way for the primetime sports programming on AksyonTV.\n\nOn October 14, 2013, along with the launch of News5's primetime block '''KBO: Karunungan, Balita, Opinyon''', Aksyon updated its newsdesk, graphics and title card. later, Aksyon became a 1-hour newscast from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nOn December 23, 2013, Aksyon, along with other [[News5]] programs, transferred from its former TV5 Studio Complex in Novaliches, Quezon City to a larger [[TV5 Media Center]] in Reliance, [[Mandaluyong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n5e.interaksyon.com/top/4EA1A901A12646E/1001/bagong-tahanan-ng-tv5-sa-mandaluyong-silipin|title= Bagong Tahanan ng TV5 sa Mandaluyong, Silipin|publisher=News5 Everywhere|accessdate= 21 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 2014, the newscast has two new segments. Caught in Aksyon focuses on issues \u2013 accidents, violation, and wrongful activities caught on CCTV Cameras. ''Makatarugan Ba?'' is about the issues that one or more individuals has a violations in a law, as explained by Atty. Mel Sta. Maria.\n\n=== Expansion (2014\u20132017) ===\n\nOn July 21, 2014, \"Aksyon\" expanded its newscast by revamping four separate newscasts: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' (replacing [[Good Morning Club]]), ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' (the reincarnation of [[Balitaang Tapat]]) back-to-back with T3 Enforced (after moving to noontime slot), the reformatted flagship ''Aksyon Prime'', and ''Aksyon Tonite'' (replacing [[Pilipinas News]] due to manpolling of its anchors like Cherie Mercado and Jove Francisco).\n\nOn October 21, 2014, ''Aksyon Prime'' cut its runtime to 45 minutes whenever [[2014\u201315 PBA season|PBA]] [[PBA on Sports5|games]] are at hand on weeknights. ''Reaksyon'' once again had a separate program after ''Aksyon Tonite''.\n\nOn November 3, 2014, Veteran [[war correspondent]] and [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] multimedia director Ed Lingao joins ''Aksyon Tonite'', replacing [[Paolo Bediones]], which left the newscast as effect of a video scandal while he was on [[GMA Network]]. Ed Lingao is previously with ABC/TV5 from 2004 \u2013 2009 as Head of News and as Contributor on Aksyon's predecessor, [[TEN: The Evening News]]. Ed Lingao's appearance was on a split screen, with Cheryl Cosim presenting from the studio while he is at the scene of the news on location. Andanar became also a temporary co-anchor with Cosim in ''Aksyon Tonite''. But during the coverage of [[Tropical Storm Fung-wong (2014)|Typhoon Mario (Fung-wong)]], Bediones, while being on a leave of absence, had an appearance on ''Aksyon Tonite'' and other ''Aksyon'' newscasts to give a report for Rescue5.\n\nPaolo Bediones joined ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' for a short period of time then later removed. However, the public service reminders from Rescue5 with Paolo Bediones were still being aired until his quiet unknown status with the network.\n\nOn January 2015, ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' shortened its airing time until 6:30 AM as the network expands its [[List of programs broadcast by The 5 Network#Cartoons|TV5 Kids]] block.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts including Aksyon News Alerts made history as they shifted to 16:9 high definition production, the first among the top three networks in the country. However, as major networks are initially testing digital terrestrial broadcasts at the time being, these newscasts are aired to viewers in a downgraded 4:3 standard definition letterbox (either on widescreen or CRT TVs).\n\nOn June 2015, all Aksyon Newscasts updated their graphic packages in full 16:9 presentation, which is currently used by major television networks in the US, Australia, most of Europe and other countries. The studio set was also renovated and expanded to accommodate an LED screen at the back of the studio with a desk for the anchor. This also the first time that ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' doesn't have a separate studio set.\n\nOn July 20, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts rescaled their graphics to allow TV5 to fit the newscast to the conventional 4:3 broadcast format. However, the letterboxing output shall remain to be used for some circumstances (such as events like the SONA where the originating source only applies to 16:9 widescreen TVs).\n\nAfter Shawn Yao's controversy on one of her live reports on TV and before anchoring a program on [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]], she left her segment in Aksyon and replaced permanently by MJ Marfori.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, Tulfo replaced Lourd de Veyra as one of the anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' Erwin and Martin's tandem in early morning television show made a return after ''Good Morning Sir''; their radio program ''Punto Asintado'' became a segment again in ''Aksyon Sa Umaga''. Erwin Tulfo is still one of the anchors of ''Aksyon Prime.''\n\nOn February 15, 2016, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' introduced ''Balitaserye,'' a five-minute crime investigation segments, anchored by Gary de Leon.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Cheryl Cosim and TV5's resident legal analyst Atty. Mel Sta. Maria replaced Martin Andanar and Erwin Tulfo as anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' This is Cheryl Cosim's return as a morning anchor/host after ''Good Morning Club'', though she still anchored ''Aksyon Tonite'' at that time''.'' This is also Atty. Mel Sta. Maria's first time to become a main anchor of a television newscast. Public service format was added on his arrival. Before this, he already became part of a segment in some newscasts of News5 where he gave similar advice to that which he gave on his radio program ''Relasyon.''\n\nOn April 2016, after many years of anchoring various newscasts, this is the first time that Martin Andanar doesn't have any television-produced programs except the continuous rerun of ''Crime Klasik'' and as host of ''Punto Asintado'' from Radyo5. He then focused on his radio and podcast career, while continuing his job as the official voice over of all News5 platforms: Radyo5, AksyonTV (except [[Sports5]] programs), N5E, and News5 programs on TV5. But on June 2016, it was revealed that Martin Andanar was appointed as the new head of [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)|PCOO]] (Presidential Communication Operations Office) under the Duterte Administration, which supervises the government's media infrastructure.\n\nOn May 2016, after the Bilang Pilipino 2016 Election Coverage, all Aksyon newscasts continued to utilize the new studio with a large LED. Unlike ABS-CBN News and GMA News who came back in their respective newscast studios after the coverage, News5 considered the Election studio as their new studio for all of its editions. However, 4:3 graphics, title cards, and OBB didn't change.

Cheryl Cosim retained her role to the morning newscast, but she left her co-presenter of ''Aksyon Tonite'' Ed Lingao who went solo for a week until Roices Naguit took over Cosim's vacated anchor's chair on the Late Night Edition in the height of the network's coverage to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The move was made after News5 axed Balita Alas Singko on weekdays which ended on November 30. However, the Saturday and Sunday editions of Balita Alas Singko still continues to air because it occupies both on Radyo5 and AksyonTV and considering to be the only news content of News5 on weekends. However, it cannot be seen on TV5 because of its radio booth format with no field reporters and video reports\n\nBy December 19, 2016, the newscast's graphic package gained rounded edges (in exception in the flipper) with orange as the standard color. It was initially used in the morning and early evening editions before implementing on the rest of the newscast. The color is now similar with their [[Cignal]] business channel [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]].\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Aksyon Prime extended its runtime every Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays to 75 minutes, with Aksyon sa Tanghali extending its runtime to a full hour seven days before the main edition. However, Aksyon Prime was scaled back to 60 minutes by February 23.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Erwin Tulfo and News5 management reached an agreement for the former to left Aksyon Prime, leaving his radio program Punto Asintado the remaining News5 program he hosted on, as well as occasional appearances with his brother [[Ben Tulfo]] for ''[[Kilos Pronto]]'' (a blocktime public-service show produced by ''Bitag Media'' for government-owned [[People's Television Network|PTV]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/first-on-mnp-erwin-tulfo-officially-out.html|title=First on MNP: Erwin Tulfo officially out as co-anchor of 'Aksyon'|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/tv5-president-and-ceo-chot-reyes-talks.html|title=TV5 President and CEO Chot Reyes talks about Erwin Tulfo's departure from 'Aksyon'|last=|first=|date=April 20, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref> Although personal concerns were the main reason for his departure to the newscast, several rumors have surrounded that it was due to his [[Duterte Diehard Supporters|strong opinion stance leaning towards]] President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], which was deemed sensitive to tackle for most Filipinos, particularly to members of the media (such as criticizing anti-Duterte supporter [[Jim Paredes]] on the DDS rally in Luneta during the 31st anniversary of [[People Power Revolution|EDSA I]] and Ed Lingao's criticisms to his opinion about opposition Sen.

As a compromise for the latter, however, News5 offered a separate online streaming on News5 Everywhere and News5's Facebook Live, where it can continue to run beyond its television broadcast. The said extension was discontinued months later.\n\n=== Reformat and major changes made by ESPN5's launch (2017\u2013present) ===\n\nNew soundtrack, openers, title cards and transition graphics (except Aksyon sa Umaga) were refreshed across all editions by August 14, 2017, replacing its 2014 version. The morning edition also replaced the AksyonTV theme with the new Aksyon soundtrack.\n\nOn September 4, 2017, Aksyon sa Umaga reduced its airtime from 75 minutes to 60 minutes to give way to some programming changes within the network.\n\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced its partnership agreement between the network and US-based sports television network [[ESPN]], who returned to Philippine television after a 5-year long hiatus. Thus the former Sports5 rebranded as ESPN5 a day after, during the coverage of Game 1 of the 2017 PBA Governor's Cup Finals between the [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel]] and the [[Meralco Bolts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE - TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|last=Bolante|first=Mikkel|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=Interaksyon}}</ref> The new sports deal showed drastic changes within News5 and Aksyon: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' was axed for good on November 3 to give way for the upcoming ESPN US' primetime programming simulcast overnight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/10/tv5-canceling-aksyon-sa-umaga-to-make-way-for-espn.html|title=TV5 canceling 'Aksyon sa Umaga' to make way for ESPN programs|last=|first=|date=October 20, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> This ended Cheryl Cosim's role as the main anchor of a News5 newscast after 7 years, although she continues radio duties at Radyo5 as well as filling-in for Cruz-Valdes on the primetime edition.

Ed Lingao and Cheryl Cosim temporarily replaced Luchi Cruz-Valdes in the newscast. Cosim served as the main anchor of the primetime edition from its inception In 2010 until 2014. While Lingao is on the primetime edition, News5 correspondent Maricel Halili took Lingao's post as sit-in anchor for Aksyon Tonite.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, the newscast had a minor change on their studio set-up and a newsdesk, which was previously used by now-defunct News5 program ''[[Reaksyon]]''. The newscast also shares its set with ''[[SportsCenter Philippines]]'' of ESPN5 and ''The Big Story'' of [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]] (before it was moved to newly launched [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] studio as the newscast was relaunched in the news channel). Aksyon Tonite also moved its timeslot at 11:00 PM to also give way to the said sports newscast. The said edition also re-extended its broadcast by 15 minutes.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Aksyon Prime reduced airtime by 15 minutes on a PBA game day. This is due to adjustment of the PBA broadcast schedule which starts at 4:30 PM, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The runtime remains the same for the non-PBA game days.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the noontime and primetime edition began airing on weekday mornings at 5:00 AM as a replay telecast, serving as the morning timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga.\n\nDuring the third week of April, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' was given a Strong Parental Guidance (SPG) rating by the MTRCB due to its public service segments profane nature. The rating also includes the news segments of the said edition.\n\nOn July 2, 2018, after her almost 7 months of absence, ''Aksyon Prime'' main anchor Luchi Cruz-Valdes returns in the newscast, joining Ed Lingao, who serves as one of the sit-in presenters while she was on her leave. Meanwhile, another sit-in anchor Cheryl Cosim made a comeback to ''Aksyon Tonite'' as main anchor. Cosim permanently replaced Lingao, who also been her former co-anchor in the late-night edition.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, upon the rebranding of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], ''Aksyon Prime''<nowiki/>'s simulcast on the channel was axed to give way to the channel's repositioning as an all-sports channel. However, the audio simulcast on Radyo5 remains intact, with added TV presence on a standalone Cignal channel of the same name, which is also aired on selected UHF free TV stations run by the radio station's owner, [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. \n\nOn February 11, 2019, Aksyon Tonite moved its timeslot at 10:30 PM, to give way for the special program as part of News5's coverage of the 2019 mid-term elections, ''Aplikante sa Senado''.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, Aksyon Primetime began simulcasting on '''One PH''', a \"teleradyo\" channel of Radyo5, on Cignal TV channel 6. Four days later, News5 announced that Aksyon Tonite will be replaced by a rebroadcast of ''[[The Big Story (TV program)|The Big Story]]'', the flagship newscast of 5's sister English news channel [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] starting March 4.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' began airing a replay once again at 6:15 AM every weekday morning. It serves as a replacement for the timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga and the ''Kids on 5'' block. The replay once again ended after a month. It was replaced by a simulcast of [[DWFM|Radyo5]]'s Morning Calls.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' re-extends its broadcast to 60 minutes during non-PBA game days. In accordance with the changes, ''Aksyon'' airs at 6:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Its PBA game day timeslot remains unchanged. These changes were brought about by 5's expansion of its news content through programs from sister station [[One PH]]; like its newscast service [[One Balita|''One Balita'']] and late night talk show [[Radyo5 92.3 News FM|''Wag Po!'']]. Weeks prior to the change, Aksyon Prime had already reintroduced their online-only extension on ''News5 Always On''. Although, it is only aired on an occasional basis.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, ''Aksyon Prime'' was permanently moved to 6:30 PM five nights a week. This change happened days before the start of PBA's 45th season, which prompts Aksyon to start at 6:30 PM every Wednesday and Friday. Thus, it also allowed 5 to air an extended afternoon entertainment block on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, both editions of ''Aksyon'' were placed on hiatus to give way to the simulcast of [[One News (TV channel)|One News]] Now's special coverage on the Luzon quarantine due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n== Newscast editions ==\n\n===Aksyon (Primetime Edition)===\n\n==== Start time differences ====\nThe primetime edition is promoted to air at 6:30 PM on weeknights, with some exceptions. In almost every PBA game day, the newscast would start at or after 6:30 PM on 5 to allow the afternoon PBA game to end with the final score of the match. Start time is also subjected to change outside PBA games, only if necessary.\n\n====Main presenters====\n* [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]] (2014\u2013present)\n* Ed Lingao (2017\u2013present)\n\n====Segment presenters====\n* [[Lourd de Veyra]] (2011\u2013present, ''Aksyon Weather'' and ''Word of the Lourd'')\n* MJ Marfori (2014\u2013present, ''Celebrity Aksyon'')\n* Lyn Olavario (2018\u2013present, ''SportsCenter sa Aksyon'')\n\n====Former main presenters====\n* [[Paolo Bediones]] (2010\u20132011)\n* [[Erwin Tulfo]] (2010\u20132017; moved to [[People's Television Network|PTV-4]], and [[Radyo Pilipinas]])\n* [[Cheryl Cosim]] (2010\u20132014; 2017\u20132018; now hosting One Balita Pilipinas for sister service Radyo5/One PH; substitute anchor for Luchi Cruz-Valdes)\n\n====Former segment presenters====\n* Paloma (2010\u20132011, ''Showbiz Aksyon'') \n* Shawn Yao (2011\u20132014, ''Showbiz Aksyon''; currently on [[One News (Philippines)|One News]])\n* Atty.

This edition always changes the schedule since the launch, due to blocktime programming or competing with other noontime newscasts. In 2018, it holds the reputation of being the only SPG-rated newscast in the country due to its public service format which they are featuring some sensitive complaints, and profanity which cannot be censored in a live program.

Mercado, pregnant when the weekend edition first aired, when she got gave birth to her child, she was replaced by Amelyn Veloso, Naomi Dayrit, and then Maricel Halili, when she was the permanent replacement for Mercado. The weekend edition, along with [[Tutok Tulfo]] was moved to late nights on October 2010 to make way for the pilot episodes of ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie]]''. Being absent on his last five weeks, Andanar was pulled out of the newscast to anchor the late-night newscast ''[[Aksyon JournalisMO]]'' on October 2010.\n\nOn October 2010, Andanar was replaced on Aksyon Weekend by his co-host on the weekday morning program ''[[Sapul sa Singko]]'', Atty.

The final episode of Aksyon Weekend aired on July 12, 2014, with Raffy Tulfo moving to Aksyon sa Tanghali and Grace Lee being assigned to Aksyon sa Umaga starting July 21, 2014.\n\nThe following week, ''Aksyon Alert'' extended their broadcast to weekends with the bulletin airing every top of the hour in the morning and a number of times in the afternoon and the evening.

A $350 million aviation support package was introduced to fund the measures such as rebates on waiving off parking charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=MOF {{!}} Singapore Budget 2020 {{!}} Supplementary Budget Statement |url=https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2020/resilience-budget/supplementary-budget-statement |website=www.singaporebudget.gov.sg |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this large spending package, it was reported that several private sector economists were still expecting the economic to contract in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/covid-19-budget-singapore-stimulus-recession-outbreak-12580774|title=Singapore's 'bazooka' stimulus to cushion COVID-19 pain, but recession still on the cards: Economists|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 17 February 2020, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of [[Chan Chun Sing]] with business people from the [[Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore. Mainly, those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, \u201c''sia suay''\u201c, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/02/chan-chun-sing-leaked/|title=Leaked audio of Singlish-spewing Chan Chun Sing impresses & dismays S'poreans at the same time|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=21 March 2020|date=20 February 2020}}</ref> In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is \"deeply disappointing\" and a \"betrayal of trust\", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tee |first1=Zhuo |title=Leak of closed-door Chan Chun Sing meeting 'deeply disappointing' and a 'betrayal', says Singapore Chinese Chamber president |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/leak-of-closed-door-chan-chun-sing-meeting-deeply-disappointing-and-a-betrayal-says |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, [[The New York Times]] argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html|title=As Coronavirus Surveillance Escalates, Personal Privacy Plummets|date=2020-03-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-24|last2=Sang-Hun|first2=Choe|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://sgwuhan.xose.net/ Interactive map of Singapore] \n* [https://corona.arrangy.com Worldwide Coronavirus Map, confirmed Cases] \u2013 Map the route paths of coronavirus confirmed cases.\n* [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 Updates on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Local Situation \u2013 Ministry of Health (Singapore)]\n* [https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html??cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna ChannelNewsAsia's COVID-19 clusters]\n* [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore The Straits Times article tracking every single case in Singapore]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Medical outbreaks in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "Darylgolden", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecond stimulus package:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore"}

For this reason, after the conclusion of the [[Chilean War of Independence]] the general [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] organized a navy that allowed his forces to siege and capture the city, declaring the independence of Peru shortly afterwards. However, there was still a strong royalist force in the Peruvian countryside. \n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] led another independentist campaign.

Neither San Mart\u00edn nor Bol\u00edvar took part in the initial development of the [[Ecuadorian War of Independence]]. The Ecuadorians discussed the future of the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, others to join Peru, and others to become a new nation.

There was Peruvian pressure on San Mart\u00edn to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.\n\n==Topics==\nSan Mart\u00edn arrived in Guayaquil on July 25, where he was enthusiastically greeted by Bol\u00edvar.  However, the two men could not come to an agreement, despite their common goals and mutual respect, even when San Mart\u00edn offered to serve under Bol\u00edvar.  Both men had very different ideas about how to organize the governments of the countries that they had liberated. Bol\u00edvar was in favor of forming a series of republics in the newly independent nations, whereas San Mart\u00edn preferred the European system of rule and wanted to put monarchies in place.
