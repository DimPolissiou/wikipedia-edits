S. Kr\u00f8yer''', was a Danish painter.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Portrait of Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer by Laurits Tuxen.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]\n\n===Growing up and early training===\nKr\u00f8yer was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, on 23 July 1851 to Ellen Cecilie Gjesdal. He was raised by Gjesdal's sister, Bertha Cecilie (born 1817) and brother-in-law, the Danish zoologist [[Henrik Nikolai Kr\u00f8yer]], after his mother was judged unfit to care for him.  Kr\u00f8yer moved to [[Copenhagen]] to live with his foster parents soon afterward.  Having begun his art education at the age of nine under private tutelage, he was enrolled in Copenhagen's Technical Institute the following year.\n\nIn 1870 at the age of 19 Kr\u00f8yer completed his studies at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]] (''{{lang|da|Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi}}''), where he had studied with [[Frederik Vermehren]]. In 1873 he was awarded the gold medal, as well as a scholarship.\n\n===Early career===\n[[Image:'Hip, Hip, Hurrah! Artist Festival at Skagen', by Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer (1888) Demisted with DXO PhotoLab Clearview; cropped away black border edge.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'', 1888]]\nHis official debut as a painter was in 1871 at [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]] with a portrait of a friend, the painter [[Frans Schwartz]]. He exhibited regularly at Charlottenborg throughout his life.\n\nIn 1874 [[Heinrich Hirschsprung]] bought his first painting from Kr\u00f8yer, establishing a long-standing patronage. Hirschsprung's collection of art forms the basis of the Hirschsprung Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n===Travels===\nBetween 1877 and 1881, Kr\u00f8yer travelled extensively in Europe, meeting artists, studying art, and developing his skills and outlook.  He stayed in [[Paris]] and studied under [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]], and undoubtedly came under the influence of contemporary [[Impressionism|impressionists]] \u2013 [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]].\n\nHe continued to travel throughout his life, constantly drawing inspiration from foreign artists and cultures.  Hirschsprung provided financial support during the early travels, and Kr\u00f8yer continued exhibiting in Denmark throughout this period.\n\n===Kr\u00f8yer comes to Skagen===\n[[File:P. S. Kr\u00f8yer at the easel painting Boys bathing , 1893.png|thumb|[[Paul Gustav Fischer]]: ''P. S. Kr\u00f8yer at the easel painting Boys bathing'', 1893]] \nIn 1882 he returned to Denmark.  He spent June\u2013October at Skagen, then a remote fishing village on the northern tip of Denmark, painting themes from local life, as well as depictions of the artistic community there.  He would continue to be associated with the developing art and literary scene at Skagen.  Other artists at Skagen included writers [[Holger Drachmann]], [[Georg Brandes]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]], and artists [[Michael Ancher]] and [[Anna Ancher]].\n\nKr\u00f8yer divided his time between rented houses in Skagen during the summer, a winter apartment in Copenhagen where he worked on his large commissioned portraits, and travel outside of the country.\n\n===Kr\u00f8yer and Marie===\n{{See also|P.S. Kr\u00f8yer's paintings of Marie}}\nOn a trip to [[Paris]] in 1888 he ran into [[Marie Triepcke Kr\u00f8yer Alfv\u00e9n|Marie Martha Mathilde Triepcke]], whom he had known in Copenhagen. They fell in love and, after a whirlwind romance, married on 23 July 1889 at her parents' home in Germany. Marie Kr\u00f8yer, who was also a painter, became associated with the Skagen community, and after their marriage was often featured in Kr\u00f8yer's paintings. The couple had one child, a daughter named Vibeke, born in January 1895. They were divorced in 1905 following a prolonged separation.\n\nKr\u00f8yer's eyesight failed him gradually over the last ten years of his life until he was totally blind. Ever the optimist, he painted almost to the end, in spite of health obstacles.  In fact, he painted some of his last masterpieces while half-blind, joking that the eyesight in his one working eye had become better with the loss of the other eye.\n\nKr\u00f8yer died in 1909 in Skagen at 58 years of age after years of declining health. He had also been in and out of [[hospital]]s, suffering from bouts of mental illness.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:P.S. Kr\u00f8yer - Summer evening on Skagen's Beach.

He painted many beach scenes featuring both recreation life on the beach (bathers, strollers), and local fishermen.\n\nAnother well-loved work is ''[[Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach]]'' (''Sankthansb\u00e5l p\u00e5 Skagen strand''), 1906.

S. Kr\u00f8yer''', was a Danish painter.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Portrait of Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer by Laurits Tuxen.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]]\n\n===Growing up and early training===\nKr\u00f8yer was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, on 23 July 1851 to Ellen Cecilie Gjesdal. He was raised by Gjesdal's sister, Bertha Cecilie (born 1817) and brother-in-law, the Danish zoologist [[Henrik Nikolai Kr\u00f8yer]], after his mother was judged unfit to care for him.  Kr\u00f8yer moved to [[Copenhagen]] to live with his foster parents soon afterward.  Having begun his art education at the age of nine under private tutelage, he was enrolled in Copenhagen's Technical Institute the following year.\n\nIn 1870 at the age of 19 Kr\u00f8yer completed his studies at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]] (''{{lang|da|Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi}}''), where he had studied with [[Frederik Vermehren]]. In 1873 he was awarded the gold medal, as well as a scholarship.\n\n===Early career===\n[[Image:'Hip, Hip, Hurrah! Artist Festival at Skagen', by Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer (1888) Demisted with DXO PhotoLab Clearview; cropped away black border edge.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'', 1888]]\nHis official debut as a painter was in 1871 at [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]] with a portrait of a friend, the painter [[Frans Schwartz]]. He exhibited regularly at Charlottenborg throughout his life.\n\nIn 1874 [[Heinrich Hirschsprung]] bought his first painting from Kr\u00f8yer, establishing a long-standing patronage. Hirschsprung's collection of art forms the basis of the Hirschsprung Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n===Travels===\nBetween 1877 and 1881, Kr\u00f8yer travelled extensively in Europe, meeting artists, studying art, and developing his skills and outlook.  He stayed in [[Paris]] and studied under [[L\u00e9on Bonnat]], and undoubtedly came under the influence of contemporary [[Impressionism|impressionists]] \u2013 [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]].\n\nHe continued to travel throughout his life, constantly drawing inspiration from foreign artists and cultures.  Hirschsprung provided financial support during the early travels, and Kr\u00f8yer continued exhibiting in Denmark throughout this period.\n\n===Kr\u00f8yer comes to Skagen===\n[[File:P. S. Kr\u00f8yer at the easel painting Boys bathing , 1893.png|thumb|[[Paul Gustav Fischer]]: ''P. S. Kr\u00f8yer at the easel painting Boys bathing'', 1893]] \nIn 1882 he returned to Denmark.  He spent June\u2013October at Skagen, then a remote fishing village on the northern tip of Denmark, painting themes from local life, as well as depictions of the artistic community there.  He would continue to be associated with the developing art and literary scene at Skagen.  Other artists at Skagen included writers [[Holger Drachmann]], [[Georg Brandes]] and [[Henrik Pontoppidan]], and artists [[Michael Ancher]] and [[Anna Ancher]].\n\nKr\u00f8yer divided his time between rented houses in Skagen during the summer, a winter apartment in Copenhagen where he worked on his large commissioned portraits, and travel outside of the country.\n\n===Kr\u00f8yer and Marie===\n{{See also|P.S. Kr\u00f8yer's paintings of Marie}}\nOn a trip to [[Paris]] in 1888 he ran into [[Marie Triepcke Kr\u00f8yer Alfv\u00e9n|Marie Martha Mathilde Triepcke]], whom he had known in Copenhagen. They fell in love and, after a whirlwind romance, married on 23 July 1889 at her parents' home in Germany. Marie Kr\u00f8yer, who was also a painter, became associated with the Skagen community, and after their marriage was often featured in Kr\u00f8yer's paintings. The couple had one child, a daughter named Vibeke, born in January 1895. They were divorced in 1905 following a prolonged separation.\n\nKr\u00f8yer's eyesight failed him gradually over the last ten years of his life until he was totally blind. Ever the optimist, he painted almost to the end, in spite of health obstacles.  In fact, he painted some of his last masterpieces while half-blind, joking that the eyesight in his one working eye had become better with the loss of the other eye.\n\nKr\u00f8yer died in 1909 in Skagen at 58 years of age after years of declining health. He had also been in and out of [[hospital]]s, suffering from bouts of mental illness.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:P.S. Kr\u00f8yer - Summer evening on Skagen's Beach.

He painted many beach scenes featuring both recreation life on the beach (bathers, strollers), and local fishermen.\n\nAnother well-loved work is ''[[Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach]]'' (''Sankthansb\u00e5l p\u00e5 Skagen strand''), 1906. This large-scale work features a great crowd of the artistic and influential Skagen community gathered around a large bonfire on the beach on Saint John's Eve ([[Midsummer|Midsummer Eve]]).\n\nBoth of these works are in the permanent collection of the [[Skagens Museum]] which is dedicated to that community of artists, including those who gathered around Kr\u00f8yer, a great organizer and bon vivant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=154px>\nFile:Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer - The Hirschsprung family portrait.

Kurzweil]], an author, inventor, and [[futurist]]. He\u2019s perhaps best known for creating an [[optical character recognition]] system that \u2013 in conjunction with a [[flatbed scanner]] and [[speech synthesis|text-to-speech synthesizer]] \u2013 reads text aloud to the sight-impaired. FatKat is an acronym derived from \"financial accelerating transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies\". The aforesaid company is one of a total of nine Kurzweil companies.<ref name=\"Port\">{{cite news |first=Otis |last=Port |title=Raymond C.

After FatKat\u2019s inception, other investment and/or software companies rushed to develop software based on this and similar [[Darwinism|Darwinist]] [[evolution]]ary principles, using [[genetic algorithm]]s.<ref name=\"Duhigg\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Kurzweil reported that the FatKat software was \"doing very well \u2013 50% to 100% returns for the last two years\".<ref name=\"Port\"/>  But as of December 2008, FatKat does not offer its software for sale.\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\nFatKat was registered as a foreign corporation in 1999 with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, Corporations Division. It was originally formed as a company in the state of [[Delaware]]. Ray Kurzweil is the president of FatKat, with Aaron Kleiner serving as [[treasurer]] and [[Company secretary|secretary]].
