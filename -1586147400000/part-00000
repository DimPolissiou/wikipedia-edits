In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\n\n==Professional wrestling==\n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling===\nIn accordance with recommendations from the Japanese Ministry of Health, [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) decided to cancel all scheduled shows from 1 March through 15 March.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.f4wonline.com/new-japan-news/njpw-cancels-shows-march-1-15-due-coronavirus-outbreak-305026 |title=NJPW CANCELS SHOWS FROM MARCH 1\u201315 DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK |first=Joseph |last=Currier |date=26 February 2020 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> On 10 March, NJPW announced that they were cancelling all shows through 22 March, which meant that they either cancelled or postponed the [[New Japan Cup#2020|2020 New Japan Cup]] as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.f4wonline.com/new-japan-news/njpw-cancels-remainder-new-japan-cup-tour-due-coronavirus-306136 |title=NJPW CANCELS REMAINDER OF NEW JAPAN CUP TOUR DUE TO CORONAVIRUS |first=Brian |last=Rose |date=10 March 2020 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> The [[World Wonder Ring Stardom|Stardom]] promotion, sister company of NJPW also owned by [[Bushiroad]], also made adjustments to their scheduled, cancelling shows from 19 February to 14 March.

In addition, the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world is believed to have resulted in more than the usual number of casual players turning to online poker as an alternative. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.\n\n==Professional wrestling==\n\n===New Japan Pro-Wrestling===\nIn accordance with recommendations from the Japanese Ministry of Health, [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) decided to cancel all scheduled shows from 1 March through 15 March.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.f4wonline.com/new-japan-news/njpw-cancels-shows-march-1-15-due-coronavirus-outbreak-305026 |title=NJPW CANCELS SHOWS FROM MARCH 1\u201315 DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK |first=Joseph |last=Currier |date=26 February 2020 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> On 10 March, NJPW announced that they were cancelling all shows through 22 March, which meant that they either cancelled or postponed the [[New Japan Cup#2020|2020 New Japan Cup]] as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.f4wonline.com/new-japan-news/njpw-cancels-remainder-new-japan-cup-tour-due-coronavirus-306136 |title=NJPW CANCELS REMAINDER OF NEW JAPAN CUP TOUR DUE TO CORONAVIRUS |first=Brian |last=Rose |date=10 March 2020 |accessdate=14 March 2020 |work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> The [[World Wonder Ring Stardom|Stardom]] promotion, sister company of NJPW also owned by [[Bushiroad]], also made adjustments to their scheduled, cancelling shows from 19 February to 14 March.

Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the [[poor]] and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948-49)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).

It is taken from the homilies of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] on [[Gospel of Matthew|Saint Matthew's Gospel]] relating to his vocation: 'Jesus saw the tax collector and by having mercy chose him as an apostle saying to him: Follow me.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_:_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705010045/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_%3A_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archivedate= 5 July 2013 |title=Pope Francis: \"Miserando atque eligendo\"... |first=Veronica |last=Scarisbrick |date=18 March 2013 |website= |publisher=[[Vatican Radio]] |accessdate=19 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>}}\n}}\n{{Infobox pope styles\n|image=Coat of arms of Franciscus.svg\n|image_size=200px\n|dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle=Your Holiness\n|relstyle=Holy Father\n|deathstyle=\n}}\n{{Catholic Church sidebar}}\n'''Pope Francis''' ({{lang-la|Franciscus}}; {{lang-it|Francesco}}; {{lang-es|Francisco}}; born '''Jorge Mario Bergoglio''';{{efn|Pronunciation: {{IPA-es|\u02c8xo\u027exe \u02c8ma\u027ejo \u03b2e\u027e\u02c8\u0263o\u0263ljo|}} (Spanish), {{IPA-it|ber\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u028e\u028eo|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is the head of the [[Catholic Church]] and [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]]. Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the [[poor]] and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948-49)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).
