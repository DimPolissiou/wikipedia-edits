It was released on May 17, 1999 by [[Mute Records|Mute]] and [[V2 Records]]. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of his fourth album, ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for ''Play'' was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within the [[electronic dance music]] scene, ''Play'' was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. ''Play'' eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/moby-on-new-memoir-the-decade-in-nyc-that-changed-his-life-20160607 |title=Moby on New Memoir, the Decade in NYC That Changed His Life |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |last=Zlatopolsky |first=Ashley}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 341 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=500greatest/><ref name=500greatest2/>\n\n==Background==\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a successful [[techno]] [[Child prodigy|wunderkind]]. The release in 1996 of ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'', a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: \"I was opening for [[Soundgarden]] and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, he claimed, \"I got one piece of fan mail from [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and I got a phone call from [[Axl Rose]] saying he was listening to ''Animal Rights'' on repeat. [[Bono]] told me he loved ''Animal Rights''. So if you're gonna have three pieces of fan mail, that's the fan mail to get.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>\n\nMoby started work on the album in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations.<ref name=CCD99>{{cite web |url=https://www.chaoscontrol.com/moby-1999/ |title=Moby |work=Chaos Control Digizine |year=1999 |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |last=Gourley |first=Bob}}</ref> Recording sessions took place in Moby's [[Mott Street]] home studio in Manhattan, New York.

A second mixing was completed in an outside studio before attempts in two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. In the end, Moby said that he had \"wasted a lot of time and money\".<ref name=CCD99/> Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after ''Play'' had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in [[Sara Delano Roosevelt Park]]: \"I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, 'When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.'\" At that point, he considered returning to school to become an architect.<ref name=RS2002>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mobys-home-made-heaven-57904/ |title=Moby's Home Made Heaven |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 6, 2002 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke}}</ref>\n\nWhen he finished recording, there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than ''Animal Rights''. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label, from [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] to [[Sony Music|Sony]] to [[RCA Records|RCA]], and was rejected every time.

For example, \"Honey\" used a sample from [[Bessie Jones (American singer)|Bessie Jones]] that consisted of a conjunction of four verses that was repeated over twenty times.

I was like, 'But the record came out 10 months ago.' That's when I knew, all of a sudden, that things were different. Then it was number one in France, in Australia, in Germany\u2014it just kept piling on. [...] The week ''Play'' was released, it sold, worldwide around 6,000 copies. Eleven months after ''Play'' was released, it was selling 150,000 copies a week. I was on tour constantly, drunk pretty much the entire time and it was just a blur. And then all of a sudden movie stars started coming to my concerts and I started getting invited to fancy parties and suddenly the journalists who wouldn't return my publicist's calls were talking about doing cover stories. It was a really odd phenomenon.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>}}\n\n''Play'' also found its major strengths on the support of its impressive string of eight hit singles, an unprecedented feat for an electronica album. Seven of those singles were UK top 40 hits\u2014\"Honey\", the first single, was already in the market in August 1998, nearly ten months before the release of the actual album. The final single choice was \"Find My Baby\", which appeared on some national charts three and a half years after.

The apparent result of the marketing strategy was that the album, after an unremarkable debut, stayed on the charts for several years and broke sales projections for Moby and for the dance music scene, which was not seen to be a dominant commercial genre in the US in the 1990s (as compared with in Europe, where Moby had initially found fame).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn October 2000, a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Play: The B Sides]]'' was released, consisting of tracks released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] on the album's singles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moby.com/discography/play-the-b-sides/ |title=Play: The B Sides |publisher=Moby.com |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby}}</ref> A [[DVD]] titled ''Play: The DVD'', produced by Moby and [[Handsome Boy Records|Jeff Rogers]], was later released in July 2001 as a companion to ''Play'', featuring most of the accompanying music videos for the album's singles, an 88-minute [[megamix]] of all the remixes created for the album accompanied by visuals created in [[Toronto]] at Crush, led by director Kathi Prosser, a performance on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', a tour diary shot by Moby and edited by Tara Bethune-Leamen entitled ''Give an Idiot a Camcorder'', a DVD-ROM component where users are able to remix two of Moby's songs, and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |others=[[Moby]] |year=2001 |title=Play: The DVD |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Mute Records]] |id=7243 4 92573 9 9}}</ref> The package was later nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90 |title=Final Nominations For The 44th Annual Grammy Awards |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=3 |location=New York |date=January 19, 2002|pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 84/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=\"CST\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC&pg=PA208 |chapter=Moby: Play |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |page=208 |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/06/11/play |title=Play |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=June 11, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Grow out the roots |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=May 14, 1999 |last=Simpson |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |title=Moby \u2013 Play |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=May 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |last=Cigarettes |first=Johnny |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001006122253/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |archivedate=October 6, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev7score = 5/10<ref name=\"DiCrescenzo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/ |title=Moby: Play |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=DiCrescenzo |first=Brent}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moby: Play |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |location=London |issue=153 |date=June 1999 |page=109}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/play-19990624 |title=Play |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Walters |first=Barry}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev10score = 9/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I5x8l8IaNUMC&pg=PA125#v=onepage |title=The Agony and the Ecstasy |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=15 |issue=7 |location=New York |date=July 1999 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |pages=125\u201326}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Play'' was met with widespread critical acclaim.

[[FM broadcasting|FM]] exposure followed. But the main reason this album will sound familiar the way [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth]] does to a [[classical music|classical]] ignoramus is that little bits of it have seeped into most Americans' brains. For this be grateful, because those bits are intensely pleasurable as melody or texture or sometimes beat, and because Moby has ordered, paced, and segued them and their intimate surroundings into something that suggests a surging and receding whole. A [[Treacherous Three]] rap powers \"Bodyrock,\" but most of the identifiable sources are little-known blues and gospel singers first archived by folklorist [[Alan Lomax]].

It was released on May 17, 1999 by [[Mute Records|Mute]] and [[V2 Records]]. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of his fourth album, ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'' (1996), which deviated from Moby's electronica style; his goal for ''Play'' was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the recording of the album took place at Moby's home studio in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work garnered critical and commercial success within the [[electronic dance music]] scene, ''Play'' was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified [[Music recording certification|platinum]] in more than 20 countries.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and commercial advertisements. ''Play'' eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/moby-on-new-memoir-the-decade-in-nyc-that-changed-his-life-20160607 |title=Moby on New Memoir, the Decade in NYC That Changed His Life |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |last=Zlatopolsky |first=Ashley}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 341 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name=500greatest/><ref name=500greatest2/>\n\n==Background==\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a successful [[techno]] [[Child prodigy|wunderkind]]. The release in 1996 of ''[[Animal Rights (album)|Animal Rights]]'', a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: \"I was opening for [[Soundgarden]] and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, he claimed, \"I got one piece of fan mail from [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and I got a phone call from [[Axl Rose]] saying he was listening to ''Animal Rights'' on repeat. [[Bono]] told me he loved ''Animal Rights''. So if you're gonna have three pieces of fan mail, that's the fan mail to get.\"<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>\n\nMoby started work on the album in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations.<ref name=CCD99>{{cite web |url=https://www.chaoscontrol.com/moby-1999/ |title=Moby |work=Chaos Control Digizine |year=1999 |accessdate=April 14, 2019 |last=Gourley |first=Bob}}</ref> Recording sessions took place in Moby's [[Mott Street]] home studio in Manhattan, New York. At the time, Moby planned on making the album his last before ending his career.<ref name=\"autobio\">{{cite book |title=[[Porcelain: A Memoir]] |publisher=[[Penguin Press]] |year=2016 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby |isbn=978-1-59420-642-9}}</ref> ''Play'' was delayed due to Moby's dissatisfaction with the initial mix of the album that he had produced at home. A second mixing was completed in an outside studio before attempts in two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. In the end, Moby said that he had \"wasted a lot of time and money\".<ref name=CCD99/> Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after ''Play'' had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in [[Sara Delano Roosevelt Park]]: \"I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, 'When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.'\" At that point, he considered returning to school to become an architect.<ref name=RS2002>{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mobys-home-made-heaven-57904/ |title=Moby's Home Made Heaven |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 6, 2002 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |last=Fricke |first=David |authorlink=David Fricke}}</ref>\n\nWhen he finished recording, there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than ''Animal Rights''. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label, from [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] to [[Sony Music|Sony]] to [[RCA Records|RCA]], and was rejected every time. After [[V2 Records|V2]] finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/> According to Moby's manager Eric H\u00e4rle, their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what ''[[Everything Is Wrong (album)|Everything Is Wrong]]'', Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_EricHaerleInt.html |title=Interview with Eric H\u00e4rle, manager at DEF for Moby, Sonique, R\u00f6yksopp |work=[[HitQuarters]] |date=March 25, 2003 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=Bouwman |first=Kimbel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609212002/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_EricHaerleInt.html |archivedate=June 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Composition and music ==\n''Play'' has been described as primarily a [[downtempo]] album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/08-05/0022_endfest__99.html |title=Endfest '99 |work=[[Kitsap Sun]] |last=McCarthy |first=Sean L. |date=August 5, 1999 |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Moby Puts V2 Debut in 'Play' |magazine=CMJ New Music Report |last=Ciabattoni |first=Steve |volume=58 |issue=619 |number=9 |page=2 |issn=0890-0795 |publisher=CMJ Network, Inc. |date=May 24, 1999 }}</ref><ref name=complex>{{cite web |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2013/08/the-15-best-songs-from-the-electronica-era/moby-play-2 |title=The 15 Best Songs From the Electronica Era |work=[[Complex.com|Complex]] |author=808SJAKE |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref> ''Complex'' wrote \"Moby's approach featured many live recordings and \"found sound\" (a colloquial term for [[field recording]]s), and the result was an organic downtempo masterpiece.

Moby was introduced to the collection through a friend, Dimitri Ehrlich, who loaned the CDs to him.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/> Most of the samples were short and constantly repeated throughout the songs. For example, \"Honey\" used a sample from [[Bessie Jones (American singer)|Bessie Jones]] that consisted of a conjunction of four verses that was repeated over twenty times. In the liner notes for the album, Moby gave \"special thanks to the Lomaxes and all of the archivists and music historians whose field recordings made this record possible.\"<ref name=\"notes\"/>\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nWhen ''Play'' was released on May 17, 1999, it underperformed commercially.

It was degrading for the most part. Their audience had less than no interest in me. February in 2000, I was in [[Minnesota]], I was depressed and my manager called me to tell me that ''Play'' was number one in the UK, and had beat out [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s ''[[Supernatural (Santana album)|Supernatural]]''. I was like, 'But the record came out 10 months ago.' That's when I knew, all of a sudden, that things were different. Then it was number one in France, in Australia, in Germany\u2014it just kept piling on. [...] The week ''Play'' was released, it sold, worldwide around 6,000 copies. Eleven months after ''Play'' was released, it was selling 150,000 copies a week. I was on tour constantly, drunk pretty much the entire time and it was just a blur. And then all of a sudden movie stars started coming to my concerts and I started getting invited to fancy parties and suddenly the journalists who wouldn't return my publicist's calls were talking about doing cover stories. It was a really odd phenomenon.<ref name=\"Christopher Weingarten\"/>}}\n\n''Play'' also found its major strengths on the support of its impressive string of eight hit singles, an unprecedented feat for an electronica album. Seven of those singles were UK top 40 hits\u2014\"Honey\", the first single, was already in the market in August 1998, nearly ten months before the release of the actual album. The final single choice was \"Find My Baby\", which appeared on some national charts three and a half years after.

The apparent result of the marketing strategy was that the album, after an unremarkable debut, stayed on the charts for several years and broke sales projections for Moby and for the dance music scene, which was not seen to be a dominant commercial genre in the US in the 1990s (as compared with in Europe, where Moby had initially found fame).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn October 2000, a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Play: The B Sides]]'' was released, consisting of tracks released as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] on the album's singles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moby.com/discography/play-the-b-sides/ |title=Play: The B Sides |publisher=Moby.com |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |author=Moby |authorlink=Moby}}</ref> A [[DVD]] titled ''Play: The DVD'', produced by Moby and [[Handsome Boy Records|Jeff Rogers]], was later released in July 2001 as a companion to ''Play'', featuring most of the accompanying music videos for the album's singles, an 88-minute [[megamix]] of all the remixes created for the album accompanied by visuals created in [[Toronto]] at Crush, led by director Kathi Prosser, a performance on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', a tour diary shot by Moby and edited by Tara Bethune-Leamen entitled ''Give an Idiot a Camcorder'', a DVD-ROM component where users are able to remix two of Moby's songs, and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |others=[[Moby]] |year=2001 |title=Play: The DVD |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Mute Records]] |id=7243 4 92573 9 9}}</ref> The package was later nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Q8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90 |title=Final Nominations For The 44th Annual Grammy Awards |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=114 |issue=3 |location=New York |date=January 19, 2002|pages=90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 84/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|4}}<ref name=\"CST\"/>\n| rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n| rev3Score = A+<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC&pg=PA208 |chapter=Moby: Play |accessdate=October 3, 2015 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |page=208 |title=[[Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s]] |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-24560-2}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev4Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/06/11/play |title=Play |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York |date=June 11, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Browne |first=David |authorlink=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev5score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Grow out the roots |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=May 14, 1999 |last=Simpson |first=Dave}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |title=Moby \u2013 Play |journal=[[NME]] |location=London |date=May 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 11, 2016 |last=Cigarettes |first=Johnny |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001006122253/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990412173158reviews.html |archivedate=October 6, 2000}}</ref>\n| rev7 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev7score = 5/10<ref name=\"DiCrescenzo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5344-play/ |title=Moby: Play |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |last=DiCrescenzo |first=Brent}}</ref>\n| rev8 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev8score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moby: Play |journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |location=London |issue=153 |date=June 1999 |page=109}}</ref>\n| rev9 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev9score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/play-19990624 |title=Play |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 1999 |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |last=Walters |first=Barry}}</ref>\n| rev10 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev10score = 9/10<ref name=\"Aaron\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I5x8l8IaNUMC&pg=PA125#v=onepage |title=The Agony and the Ecstasy |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=15 |issue=7 |location=New York |date=July 1999 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |last=Aaron |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Aaron |pages=125\u201326}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Play'' was met with widespread critical acclaim.

[[FM broadcasting|FM]] exposure followed. But the main reason this album will sound familiar the way [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth]] does to a [[classical music|classical]] ignoramus is that little bits of it have seeped into most Americans' brains. For this be grateful, because those bits are intensely pleasurable as melody or texture or sometimes beat, and because Moby has ordered, paced, and segued them and their intimate surroundings into something that suggests a surging and receding whole. A [[Treacherous Three]] rap powers \"Bodyrock,\" but most of the identifiable sources are little-known blues and gospel singers first archived by folklorist [[Alan Lomax]].

The company established a library and its [[Clockmakers' Museum|Museum]] in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide.<ref>https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/clockmakers-museum</ref> This is administered by the company's affiliated charity, the Clockmakers\u2019 Charity,<ref>Charity No. 275380 registered with the UK Charity Commission</ref> and is presently housed on the second floor of London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The modern aims of the company and its Museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the [[HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts]].\n\n==Museum==\nThe [[Clockmakers' Museum|Clockmakers\u2019 Museum]], first established in 1813, was housed at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] from 1874 to 2014. The collection of clocks and watches was moved to a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by HRH [[Princess Anne]] on 22 October 2015. The company's archive and library are however still kept at [[Guildhall Library]]. The collection includes [[John Harrison|John Harrison's]] sea watch H5, once personally tested by [[King George III]].\n\n==Motto==\nThe company's motto, ''Tempus Rerum Imperator'', can be translated as \u2018Time, the Ruler of All Things\u2019. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], a liveryman of the company. It has also been adopted by the [[Google Web Accelerator]] project.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of [[turret clocks]]. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the Continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the [[Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths|Blacksmiths\u2019 Company]], though some were members of other livery companies, notably the [[Worshipful Company of Clothworkers|Clothworkers]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Lantern Clocks|last=White|first=George|publisher=ACC|year=1989|location=|pages=51\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAfter the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the King issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a Royal Charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Clockmakers of London|last=White|first=George|publisher=WCC|year=2018|location=London|pages=14\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe Charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have \u2018continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking\u2019. It provided that the Fellowship should be governed by a Master, three Wardens and ten or more Assistants who would form the Court. The first Master was [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]], a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to [[James VI of Scotland]], later James I of England.

They were most famous for their work on television, most notably ''[[Fist of Fun]]'' and ''[[This Morning with Richard Not Judy]]'' but had  been working together on stage and on radio since the late 1980s.\n\nAs with many double acts, Lee and Herring performed as contrasting personalities: one mature and duplicitous (Lee) and the other puerile and cheeky (Herring). As with several other double acts, Lee and Herring had a certain [[irony]] to their style and constantly checked themselves and made reference to this. The characters of Lee and Herring were [[parody|parodies]] and exaggerations of their real life selves.\n\nIn 2011, [[Frank Skinner]] cited Lee and Herring as one of his favourite comedy double acts, alongside [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[The Two Ronnies]] and [[Reeves and Mortimer]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Frank Skinner |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2082122/The-Two-Ronnies-Reeves--Mortimer-The-greatest-comedy-double-acts.html |title=The Two Ronnies to Reeves & Mortimer: The top ten greatest comedy double acts &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-01-07 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nLee and Herring first met at a party while they were studying at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-stewart-lee-richard-herring-1088166.html|title=How we met: Stewart Lee & Richard Herring|date=18 April 1999|author=Laurence Phelan|website=The Independent|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref> Lee had been performing stand-up on the circuit for a short while and had heard that Herring had been trying to as well, so he introduced himself. Lee once remarked that one of the reasons they decided to work as a double act was that they found the resemblance of the title \"Lee and Herring\" to [[Worcestershire sauce]] brand [[Lea & Perrins]] humorous.\n\nAt Oxford, Lee and Herring performed in a regular comedy revue called The [[Seven Raymonds]], which also included the material and performance of [[Emma Kennedy]], Michael Cosgrave and [[Tim Richardson (writer)|Tim Richardson]].\n\nTogether they wrote material for [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]' ''[[On The Hour]]'' (1991). However, a management conflict meant that the duo were not involved in the television version, ''[[The Day Today]]'', and that their material was edited out of the original official BBC audio releases of ''On The Hour'' (it was later re-instated in a 2009 CD release on [[Warp Records]].\n\nIn 1992 and 1993, they wrote and performed ''[[Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World]]'' for [[BBC Radio 4]]. For [[BBC Radio 1]], they wrote and performed one series of ''[[Fist of Fun]]'' (1993), which later transferred to television and would pave the way for their mainstream success. ''Fist of Fun'' made several subtle references to their dislike for former colleague [[Patrick Marber]]. Lee and Herring fell out with the ''On The Hour'' team after a row over ownership of characters; Patrick Marber has claimed that he invented the character of news reporter [[Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan]], while Lee and Herring also claim to have invented the character.<ref>A text box in Fist of Fun's first series.</ref>\n\nAfter the radio version of ''Fist of Fun'', they presented another Radio 1 show running for 3 series, simply entitled ''[[Lee and Herring (radio series)|Lee and Herring]]'' (but often referred to as ''Lee & Herring's Radio One Music Show'') which featured a mixture of records chosen by the duo themselves, and their comedy sketches and discussions.\n\nTheir final major work as a double-act was ''[[This Morning With Richard Not Judy]]'' (''TMWRNJ''), which aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]] for series in 1998 and 1999, and was famous{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} for being increasingly risqu\u00e9 and original.\n\n==Break-up==\nLee and Herring went their separate ways at the end of the 1990s and have both enjoyed major fringe and mainstream fame. Stewart Lee retired from stand-up comedy in the early 2000s, a time in which he co-wrote ''[[Jerry Springer - The Opera]]'' and directed ''[[Attention Scum!]]'' for [[Simon Munnery]]. He made a comeback to stand-up in 2005, touring very successful shows, and has written and performed four series of his own [[BBC 2]] television show ''[[Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle]]''.\n\nRichard Herring went on to write the sitcoms ''[[Time Gentlemen Please]]'' for [[Sky One]] with [[Al Murray]], and ''You Can Choose Your Friends'' (which was loosely based on his own family) for [[ITV Network|ITV]], and worked on the third series of ''[[Little Britain]]'' as script editor. Herring has written, performed and toured with a number of successful comedy shows including ''Christ on a Bike'', ''Hitler Moustache'' and ''We're All Going To Die'', building up an audience through the medium of podcasts which include ''[[Collings and Herrin (podcast)|Collings and Herrin]]'' with Andrew Collins and his interview show ''[[Richard Herring Interviews|Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''. 2013 is his 22nd year at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], where he has performed 10 different stand-up shows in as many years.\n\n==Reunions==\n\nLee and Herring occasionally reunite for one-off events. Recent collaborations include an interview together for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and a 2005 review of each other's work for the arts supplement of ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.\n\nThe pair performed a short set at [[London]]'s [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] on 5 February 2007 as part of a tribute to stand-up comedian [[Ted Chippington]].\n\nThey reunited for a 30-minute performance at the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Theatre]] in [[Hammersmith]] on 16 November 2008, where they were joined at the end by a resurrected \"Curious Orange\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/nov/18/comedy</ref>\n\nA brief reunion took place at the 2010 Edinburgh Fringe at Stewart Lee's ''Silver Stewbilee'' show in which Herring heckled him and ran on stage, berating him for his \"pretentious\" new book.<ref>http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2010/s/17776/stewart_lee%3A_silver_stewbilee/review</ref> Lee also \"appeared\" as a recorded [[voicemail]] message on ''[[The Collings and Herrin Podcast]] Live'' the following day.\n\nHerring interviewed Lee in June 2012 on his series ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''.

There are two known species: '''''Bannana crassispina''''' and '''''B. parvula''''', both described in 2015. Individuals are pale yellow and unpatterned, and range from around 1.0 to 1.8&nbsp;mm in body length, with females being slightly larger than males. The eyes are reduced or entirely absent. Known only from a nature reserve in Xishuangbanna, ''Bannana'' belongs to a group of Asian goblin spiders known as the \"''Dysderoides'' complex\", that ranges from China to Pakistan and south to Indonesia.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Bannana crassispina female lateral.jpg|thumb|left|Side view of female ''B. crassispina'' specimen showing sclerotized abdominal scutum. Scale bar=0.4 mm]]\nSpecies of ''Bannana'' are generally similar in overall appearance, although ''B. parvula'' is smaller. The body color is yellow, without pattern. Eyes are absent or highly reduced, visible only as remnants in ''B. crassispina''. The [[cephalothorax]] or [[prosoma]] is broadly oval when viewed from above, and the abdomen or [[opisthosoma]] is somewhat oval-shaped, and rounded at the rear.
