Jounieh is known for its seaside resorts and bustling nightlife, as well as its old stone [[souk]], ferry port, paragliding site and [[gondola lift]] (''le [[t\u00e9l\u00e9ph\u00e9rique (Jounieh)|t\u00e9l\u00e9ph\u00e9rique]]''), which takes passengers up the mountain to the shrine of [[Our Lady of Lebanon]] in [[Harissa, Lebanon|Harissa]]. \n\nAbove Jounieh, and on the way to [[Harissa, Lebanon|Harissa]], a small hill named [[Bkerk\u00e9]] ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0643\u0631\u0643\u064a|links=no}}, or ''Bkerki''), overlooking the Jounieh bay, is the seat of the Patriarch of the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] Catholic Church. Residents of Jounieh and the surrounding towns are overwhelmingly [[Maronite Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} '''Maameltein''' is a district of the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CasinoduLiban.jpg|thumb|[[Casino du Liban]]]]\n[[File:3133 (8)jounieh.JPG|thumb]]\n[[File:Paragliding take-off.png|thumb|[[Paragliding]] over the Jounieh Bay]]\n[[File:Jounieh Bay Fisheye (4012270469).jpg|thumb|View from [[Harissa, Lebanon]]]]\nIn the sixth part of ''The Introduction to Jounieh in the Mid Nineteenth Century'', Professor [[Butrus al-Bustani|Butrus Al-Boustani]] said: \u201cJounieh is a place on the [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]] coast which has warehouses, stores, and a dye house. Ships and boats bring supplies and its grain trade is very popular. Thus a district of the following villages: Sarba, Ghadir, and Harat Sakhr was named for it. Its total population is 2,500. Jounieh itself is not a residential area but mainly a commercial district whose workers come from neighboring towns.\u201d\n\nJounieh was connected with neighboring areas by roads built for carriages. So it was connected with [[Bkerk\u00e9]] and beyond it during the rule of Dawud Basha, the ruler of [[Mount Lebanon]]. It was connected to Ghazir between 1867 and 1868 despite the objection of Ghazir\u2019s residents. Another road connected Jounieh to the Beirut Bridge during the rule of Rustum Basha. To the north it was connected by a carriage\u2019s road until [[Batroun]] during the rule of Wasa Basha (1883\u20131892). In 1892, Jounieh was connected to [[Beirut]] via a railroad that had stations between the two locations, three of which in Jounieh and its environs: Sarba, Jounieh, and Mu\u2019amilitain at the end of the line, which facilitated the transportation of goods and passengers from and to the Governorate of Beirut. In 1876, the number of shops exceeded 300, five silk factories, three rest houses, a mill, three juice factories, an artificial ice factory, a bank known by its owner's name \"Bank Baghos\", and a group of small sailboat construction sites.\n\nIn 1906, according to the ''Guide to Lebanon'' by Ibrahim Beik Al-Soud, the population of Jounieh was 2,400, and it had a silk factory owned by the Nasras, a silkworms choker owned by Moussa de Franj, a silk factory owned by the heirs of Rizkallah and Abdul Ahad Khadra which had 190 wheels and produced 10,000 cocoons, 330 domestic animals, and owned 80 carriages.\nAccording to the records of the Keserwan Governorate, the town of Ghadir, in 1914, had 433 corporations and its population was 1,263. The town of Sarba had 213 commercial institutions and its population was 1,714. In Harat Sakhr, there were 165 corporations and its population was 808. In Sahil \u2018Alma, there were 21 corporations its population reached 187. Jounieh had seen noticeable prosperity after France and the [[Maronite]] Patriarchy supported the opening a port for commercial ships which became (with the Al-Nabi Younes Port on the [[Chouf]] Coast) the official port of [[Mount Lebanon]].\n\n{{Wide Image|Jounieh At Sunset From Adma.jpg|600px|Jounieh Bay At Sunset 2016}}\n\nIn 1913 and during the Mandate era, Jounieh suffered economic decline and recession as the French administration moved part of Jounieh\u2019s administrative role to the Capital, [[Beirut]]. Also Jounieh came out of the [[First World War]] weakened by famine and economic stagnation. So several of its inhabitants were forced to move to the capital or to immigrate, and Jounieh lost most of its expertise. Its social and population development stopped, and its economic development weakened. The 1932 statistics showed 1,286 housed in Jounieh: 371 in Sarba, 434 in Ghadir, 350 houses in Harat Sakhr, and 131 in Sahil \u2018Alma. This affected the building industry and records in the town hall showed very limited number of permits given from 1922-1940. The only active sectors in that period were schools, small crafts, and planting of citrus trees, sugar cane, and vegetables. This situation stayed the same until the rule of President [[Fuad Chehab]] who outfitted the city with all that it needed to become modern. Jounieh then awakened from its slumber with projects for roads, lighting, modern planning, a stadium, a tourist port, a government house, and infrastructure. President Chehab used a number of experts and engineers headed by the French engineer Ecochard. The talk became of \u201cMonte Carlo of the East\u201d and Jounieh stood out as a bride of the Lebanese coast. In 1959, it started to attract banks, the first which were the Lebanese Commerce Bank and the Lebanese Federal Bank. By 1975 the number of banks reached six and today there are 38 banks in addition to the Lebanese Central Bank which was established in 1879.\n\nThe area also witnessed an increase in the price of land from an average of seven to nine Lebanese pounds per square meter between 1950 and 1960 to an average of 25 to 35 Lebanese pounds in 1965.\n\nThe construction sector developed slowly starting from Sarba to Harat Sakhr, and finally the coast of \u2018Alma. The buildings also started expanding around the city as the agricultural sector contracted and became confined to the coasts of [[Kaslik]] and some orchards in Ghadir, Harat Sakhr and the coast of \u2018Alma. In the beginning of the seventies, Jounieh was transformed to a major and complete tourist center with the tourist network around it and on its edges including: [[Casino du Liban]], the cable cars, the Harisa Church, the caverns in [[Jeita Grotto|Jeita]], restaurants, hotels, nightclubs, and the port.\n\nWith the war of 1975, and the division of [[Beirut]] into East and West parts and the escalation of the violence, many people fled to safe areas and were organizing their lives in accordance with the new realities.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, Jounieh witnessed a massive migration as a large number of the Beirut traders moved to its markets. Buildings took over its green spaces, and the tourist complexes took over its shores. So its features changed randomly though it benefited from the use of the tourist port for commerce.\n\nToday, close to 100,000 people reside in Jounieh. Those who live in its suburbs exceed that number. By the middle of the century, it is predicted that Jounieh will become a suburb of Beirut in a coastal line that forms one city that expands the length of the coastal road at a time when the inhabitants of Lebanon will reach six million plus around the year 2025.<ref>http://www.jounieh.gov.lb/index.php</ref>\n\n==International relations==\nJounieh is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|MON}} [[Monaco]], Monaco\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Gustavia, Saint Barthelemy]], France\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil\n\n==Climate==\nJounieh has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').

Residents of Jounieh and the surrounding towns are overwhelmingly [[Maronite Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} '''Maameltein''' is a district of the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CasinoduLiban.jpg|thumb|[[Casino du Liban]]]]\n[[File:3133 (8)jounieh.JPG|thumb]]\n[[File:Paragliding take-off.png|thumb|[[Paragliding]] over the Jounieh Bay]]\n[[File:Jounieh Bay Fisheye (4012270469).jpg|thumb|View from [[Harissa, Lebanon]]]]\nIn the sixth part of ''The Introduction to Jounieh in the Mid Nineteenth Century'', Professor [[Butrus al-Bustani|Butrus Al-Boustani]] said: \u201cJounieh is a place on the [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]] coast which has warehouses, stores, and a dye house. Ships and boats bring supplies and its grain trade is very popular. Thus a district of the following villages: Sarba, Ghadir, and Harat Sakhr was named for it. Its total population is 2,500. Jounieh itself is not a residential area but mainly a commercial district whose workers come from neighboring towns.\u201d\n\nJounieh was connected with neighboring areas by roads built for carriages. So it was connected with [[Bkerk\u00e9]] and beyond it during the rule of Dawud Basha, the ruler of [[Mount Lebanon]]. It was connected to Ghazir between 1867 and 1868 despite the objection of Ghazir\u2019s residents. Another road connected Jounieh to the Beirut Bridge during the rule of Rustum Basha. To the north it was connected by a carriage\u2019s road until [[Batroun]] during the rule of Wasa Basha (1883\u20131892). In 1892, Jounieh was connected to [[Beirut]] via a railroad that had stations between the two locations, three of which in Jounieh and its environs: Sarba, Jounieh, and Mu\u2019amilitain at the end of the line, which facilitated the transportation of goods and passengers from and to the Governorate of Beirut. In 1876, the number of shops exceeded 300, five silk factories, three rest houses, a mill, three juice factories, an artificial ice factory, a bank known by its owner's name \"Bank Baghos\", and a group of small sailboat construction sites.\n\nIn 1906, according to the ''Guide to Lebanon'' by Ibrahim Beik Al-Soud, the population of Jounieh was 2,400, and it had a silk factory owned by the Nasras, a silkworms choker owned by Moussa de Franj, a silk factory owned by the heirs of Rizkallah and Abdul Ahad Khadra which had 190 wheels and produced 10,000 cocoons, 330 domestic animals, and owned 80 carriages.\nAccording to the records of the Keserwan Governorate, the town of Ghadir, in 1914, had 433 corporations and its population was 1,263. The town of Sarba had 213 commercial institutions and its population was 1,714. In Harat Sakhr, there were 165 corporations and its population was 808. In Sahil \u2018Alma, there were 21 corporations its population reached 187. Jounieh had seen noticeable prosperity after France and the [[Maronite]] Patriarchy supported the opening a port for commercial ships which became (with the Al-Nabi Younes Port on the [[Chouf]] Coast) the official port of [[Mount Lebanon]].\n\n{{Wide Image|Jounieh At Sunset From Adma.jpg|600px|Jounieh Bay At Sunset 2016}}\n\nIn 1913 and during the Mandate era, Jounieh suffered economic decline and recession as the French administration moved part of Jounieh\u2019s administrative role to the Capital, [[Beirut]]. Also Jounieh came out of the [[First World War]] weakened by famine and economic stagnation. So several of its inhabitants were forced to move to the capital or to immigrate, and Jounieh lost most of its expertise. Its social and population development stopped, and its economic development weakened. The 1932 statistics showed 1,286 housed in Jounieh: 371 in Sarba, 434 in Ghadir, 350 houses in Harat Sakhr, and 131 in Sahil \u2018Alma. This affected the building industry and records in the town hall showed very limited number of permits given from 1922-1940. The only active sectors in that period were schools, small crafts, and planting of citrus trees, sugar cane, and vegetables. This situation stayed the same until the rule of President [[Fuad Chehab]] who outfitted the city with all that it needed to become modern. Jounieh then awakened from its slumber with projects for roads, lighting, modern planning, a stadium, a tourist port, a government house, and infrastructure. President Chehab used a number of experts and engineers headed by the French engineer Ecochard. The talk became of \u201cMonte Carlo of the East\u201d and Jounieh stood out as a bride of the Lebanese coast. In 1959, it started to attract banks, the first which were the Lebanese Commerce Bank and the Lebanese Federal Bank. By 1975 the number of banks reached six and today there are 38 banks in addition to the Lebanese Central Bank which was established in 1879.\n\nThe area also witnessed an increase in the price of land from an average of seven to nine Lebanese pounds per square meter between 1950 and 1960 to an average of 25 to 35 Lebanese pounds in 1965.\n\nThe construction sector developed slowly starting from Sarba to Harat Sakhr, and finally the coast of \u2018Alma. The buildings also started expanding around the city as the agricultural sector contracted and became confined to the coasts of [[Kaslik]] and some orchards in Ghadir, Harat Sakhr and the coast of \u2018Alma. In the beginning of the seventies, Jounieh was transformed to a major and complete tourist center with the tourist network around it and on its edges including: [[Casino du Liban]], the cable cars, the Harisa Church, the caverns in [[Jeita Grotto|Jeita]], restaurants, hotels, nightclubs, and the port.\n\nWith the war of 1975, and the division of [[Beirut]] into East and West parts and the escalation of the violence, many people fled to safe areas and were organizing their lives in accordance with the new realities.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, Jounieh witnessed a massive migration as a large number of the Beirut traders moved to its markets. Buildings took over its green spaces, and the tourist complexes took over its shores. So its features changed randomly though it benefited from the use of the tourist port for commerce.\n\nToday, close to 100,000 people reside in Jounieh. Those who live in its suburbs exceed that number. By the middle of the century, it is predicted that Jounieh will become a suburb of Beirut in a coastal line that forms one city that expands the length of the coastal road at a time when the inhabitants of Lebanon will reach six million plus around the year 2025.<ref>http://www.jounieh.gov.lb/index.php</ref>\n\n==International relations==\nJounieh is [[twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|MON}} [[Monaco]], Monaco\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Gustavia, Saint Barthelemy]], France\n*{{flagicon|BRA}} [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil\n\n==Climate==\nJounieh has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').
