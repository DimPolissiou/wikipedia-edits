This uses a [[potassium hydroquinone monosulfate]] - [[phenidone]] black & white film developer, with the preferred form of phenidone being 4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone (13047-13-7). The first developer forms a negative silver image in each layer of the film. The first developer is time and temperature sensitive because it controls contrast.<ref name=\"Z119-all\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/Zmanuals/z119.shtml | title=Process E-6 Using KODAK Chemicals, Process E-6 Publication Z-119 | publisher=[[Kodak]] | accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>\n* First wash: Water stop bath, 2:00 @ 100.0&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C). This step once used an acetic acid stop bath, but was replaced with a water-only bath for process economy, with concomitant slight reduction of first developer strength.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Reversal bath: 2:00 @ 96-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (35.6-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This bath prepares the film for the color developer step. A chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, which is instantly effective. The reversal step can also be carried out using 800 [[footcandle]]-seconds (8.6 [[kilolux|klx]]\u00b7s) of light - this variation is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems such as contamination and issues of low tank turnover as process volumes decline.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Color developer bath: 6:00 @ 96-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (35.6-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This step is carried out to completion. The developer contains [[Color Developing Agent 3|CD-3]] developing agent, and acts upon the chemically exposed silver halide that was not developed in the first developer to form a positive silver image. The metallic negative silver image formed in the first developer has no part in the reaction of this step. As the color development progresses, a metallic positive silver image is formed and the color developing agent is oxidized. Oxidized color developer molecules react with the color couplers and color dyes are formed in each of the three layers of the film.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" /> Each layer of the film contains different color couplers, which react with the same oxidized developer molecules but form different color dyes. Variation in color developer pH causes color shifts on the green-magenta axis with Kodak E100G & E100GX and [[Fujichrome]] films and on the yellow-blue axis with older Ektachrome films.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/e4024/e4024.jhtml | title=KODAK PROFESSIONAL EKTACHROME Films E100G and E100GX | publisher=[[Kodak]] | accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>\n* Pre-bleach bath: 2:00 @ 90-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (32.2-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This bath was previously called \"conditioner\", but was renamed pre-bleach in the mid-1990s to reflect the removal of formaldehyde from the process used in the final rinse. In this solution, [[formaldehyde]] acts as a dye preservative and [[EDTA]] is used to \"kick off\" the bleach. The pre-bleach bath relies on carry-over of the color developer to function properly, therefore there is no wash step between the color developer and pre-bleach baths.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Bleach bath: 6:00 @ 92-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (33.3-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This is a process-to-completion step, and relies on carry-over of pre-bleach to initiate the bleach. The bleach converts metallic silver into [[silver bromide]], which is converted to soluble silver compounds by the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is converted to iron (II) EDTA (Fe<sup>3+</sup> EDTA + Ag + Br<sup>\u2212</sup>\u2192 Fe<sup>2+</sup> EDTA + AgBr) before fixing. Kodak also has a process variant which uses a higher concentration of bleach and a 4:00 bath time; but with process volumes declining, this variant has become uneconomical.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Wash step (optional): Rinses off the bleach and extends the life of the fixer bath. This wash step is recommended for rotary tube, sink line and other low volume processing.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Fixer bath: 4:00 @ 92-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (33.3-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This is a process-to-completion step.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Second fixer stage (optional): Using fresh fixer.

The first developer is time and temperature sensitive because it controls contrast.<ref name=\"Z119-all\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/Zmanuals/z119.shtml | title=Process E-6 Using KODAK Chemicals, Process E-6 Publication Z-119 | publisher=[[Kodak]] | accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>\n* First wash: Water stop bath, 2:00 @ 100.0&nbsp;\u00b0F (37.8&nbsp;\u00b0C). This step once used an acetic acid stop bath, but was replaced with a water-only bath for process economy, with concomitant slight reduction of first developer strength.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Reversal bath: 2:00 @ 96-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (35.6-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This bath prepares the film for the color developer step. A chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, which is instantly effective. The reversal step can also be carried out using 800 [[footcandle]]-seconds (8.6 [[kilolux|klx]]\u00b7s) of light - this variation is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems such as contamination and issues of low tank turnover as process volumes decline.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Color developer bath: 6:00 @ 96-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (35.6-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This step is carried out to completion. The developer contains [[Color Developing Agent 3|CD-3]] developing agent, and acts upon the chemically exposed silver halide that was not developed in the first developer to form a positive silver image. The metallic negative silver image formed in the first developer has no part in the reaction of this step. As the color development progresses, a metallic positive silver image is formed and the color developing agent is oxidized. Oxidized color developer molecules react with the color couplers and color dyes are formed in each of the three layers of the film.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" /> Each layer of the film contains different color couplers, which react with the same oxidized developer molecules but form different color dyes. Variation in color developer pH causes color shifts on the green-magenta axis with Kodak E100G & E100GX and [[Fujichrome]] films and on the yellow-blue axis with older Ektachrome films.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/e4024/e4024.jhtml | title=KODAK PROFESSIONAL EKTACHROME Films E100G and E100GX | publisher=[[Kodak]] | accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref>\n* Pre-bleach bath: 2:00 @ 90-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (32.2-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This bath was previously called \"conditioner\", but was renamed pre-bleach in the mid-1990s to reflect the removal of formaldehyde from the process used in the final rinse. In this solution, [[formaldehyde]] acts as a dye preservative and [[EDTA]] is used to \"kick off\" the bleach. The pre-bleach bath relies on carry-over of the color developer to function properly, therefore there is no wash step between the color developer and pre-bleach baths.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Bleach bath: 6:00 @ 92-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (33.3-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This is a process-to-completion step, and relies on carry-over of pre-bleach to initiate the bleach. The bleach converts metallic silver into [[silver bromide]], which is converted to soluble silver compounds by the fixer. During bleaching, iron (III) EDTA is converted to iron (II) EDTA (Fe<sup>3+</sup> EDTA + Ag + Br<sup>\u2212</sup>\u2192 Fe<sup>2+</sup> EDTA + AgBr) before fixing. Kodak also has a process variant which uses a higher concentration of bleach and a 4:00 bath time; but with process volumes declining, this variant has become uneconomical.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Wash step (optional): Rinses off the bleach and extends the life of the fixer bath. This wash step is recommended for rotary tube, sink line and other low volume processing.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Fixer bath: 4:00 @ 92-103&nbsp;\u00b0F (33.3-39.4&nbsp;\u00b0C). This is a process-to-completion step.<ref name=\"Z119-all\" />\n* Second fixer stage (optional): Using fresh fixer. The archival properties of film and paper are greatly improved using a second fixing stage in a reverse cascade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=007dXZ | title=Why two step fixing is a Really Good Thing | first=Dan | last=Schwartz | publisher=Photo.net | date=March 8, 2004 | accessdate=2007-07-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624070935/http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=007dXZ | archive-date=June 24, 2007 | url-status=dead }} Note that this is the Photo.Net discussion thread of the 1998 technical paper by [[Dr. Michael J.
