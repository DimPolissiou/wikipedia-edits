Much of Amber's current buildings were started or expanded during the reign of Raja Man Singh I in the 1600s. Among the chief building is the Diwan-i-Khas in Amber Palace of Rajasthan and the elaborately painted Ganesh Poll built by the Mirza Raja Jai Singh I.<ref name=DNA/>\n\nThe current Amer Palace was created in the late 16th century, as a larger palace to the already existing home of the rulers. The older palace, known as Kadimi Mahal (Persian for ancient) is known to be the oldest surviving palace in India. This ancient palace sits in the valley behind the Amer Palace.\n\nAmer was known in the medieval period as [[Dhundar]] (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards \u2013 between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer.<ref name=\"KhangarotNathawat1990\">{{cite book|author1=R.

This is one of the four courtyards of Amer Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693\u20131743 AD). Maharaja's personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or ''Fauj Bakshi''. The Maharaja used to inspect the guards contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables, with the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.<ref name=Jaleb>{{Cite web|url=https://mysterioustrip.com/amber-fort-palace-jaipur/ |title= Amber Fort Jaleb Chowk |accessdate=22 November 2017 |publisher= mysterioustrip.com}}</ref>\n\n===First courtyard===\n[[File:Amer Fort Entrance.jpg|thumb|Ganesh Pol Entrance]]\nAn impressive stairway from Jalebi Chowk leads into the main palace grounds. Here, at the entrance to the right of the stairway steps is the Sila Devi temple where the Rajput Maharajas worshipped, starting with Maharaja Mansingh in the 16th century until the 1980s, when the animal sacrifice ritual (sacrifice of a buffalo) practiced by the royalty was stopped.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nGanesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, named after the [[Hindu god]] [[Lord Ganesh]], who removes all obstacles in life, is the entry into the private palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that were also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621\u20131627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies of the royal family used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through latticed marble windows called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|j\u00e2l\u00ees]]\".<ref name=Jaleb1>{{Cite web|url=https://mysterioustrip.com/amber-fort-palace-jaipur/ |title=Information on Ganesh Pol |accessdate=22 November 2017 |publisher=mysterioustrip.com}}</ref>\n\n; Sila Devi temple\n[[File: Silver door in Amber Fort, Rajasthan.jpg|left|thumb|Embossed double leaf silver door entry into the Sila Devi temple]]\nOn the right side of the Jalebi Chowk, there is a small but an elegant temple called the Sila Devi temple (Sila Devi was an incarnation of [[Kali]] or [[Durga]]). The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, there is also a carving of [[Lord Ganesha]], which is made out of a single piece of [[coral]].<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nAnother version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone slab which was said to have a link to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story in which [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had killed older siblings of [[Lord Krishna]] on this stone. In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of [[Durga]] [[Mahishasuramardini]], who had slain the demon king [[Mahishasura]] and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of [[Jamwa Ramgarh|Ramgarh]].<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\nAnother practice that is associated with this temple is the religious rites of animal sacrifice during the festival days of [[Navrathri]] (a nine-day festival celebrated twice a year). The practice was to sacrifice a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and also [[goats]] on the eighth day of the festival in front of the temple, which would be done in the presence of the royal family, watched by a large gathering of devotees. This practice was banned under the law from 1975, after which the sacrifice was held within the palace grounds in Jaipur, strictly as a private event with only the close kin of the royal family watching the event. However, now the practice of animal sacrifice has been totally stopped at the temple premises and offerings made to the goddess are only of the vegetarian type.<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\n===Second courtyard===\nThe second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n===Third courtyard===\n[[File:Amber Fort interior.jpg|thumb|Mirrored ceiling in the Mirror Palace]]\n[[File:Amber Fort - Sheesh Mahal Interior.jpg|thumb|Sheesh Mahal Interior]]\nThe third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the [[Mughal Gardens]]. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir, which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a \"glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight\".<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>  Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in the 16th century and completed in 1727. It is also the foundation year of Jaipur state.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=9&name=Sheesh%20mahal%20Amer%20palace|title = Sheesh mahal Amer palace|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = www.amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit Kumar Pareek and Agam kumar}}</ref> However, most of this work was allowed to deteriorate during the period 1970\u201380 but has since then been in the process of restoration and renovation. The walls around the hall hold carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nOn top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and [[alabaster]] relief work.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\nThe other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a [[sandalwood]] door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|ch\u00een\u00ee kh\u00e2na]]\". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.\n\n; Magic flower\nA particular attraction here is the \"magic flower\" carved marble panel at the base of one of the pillars around the mirror palace depicting two hovering butterflies; the flower has seven unique designs including a fishtail, lotus, hooded cobra, elephant trunk, lion's tail, cob of corn, and scorpion, each one of which is visible by a special way of partially hiding the panel with the hands.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\n; Garden\nThe garden, located between the Jai Mandir on the east and the Sukh Niwas on the west, both built on high platforms in the third courtyard, was built by Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1623\u201368). It is patterned on the lines of the Chahar Bagh or Mughal Garden. It is in a sunken bed, shaped in a hexagonal design. It is laid out with narrow channels lined with marble around a star-shaped pool with a fountain at the center. Water for the garden flows in cascades through channels from the Sukh Niwas and also from the cascade channels called the ''\"chini khana niches\"'' that originate on the terrace of the Jai Mandir.<ref name=\"Ruggles2008\"/>\n\n; Tripolia gate\nTripolia gate means three gates. It is access to the palace from the west. It opens in three directions, one to the Jaleb Chowk, another to the Man Singh Palace and the third one to the Zenana Deorhi on the south.\n\n; Lion gate\nThe Lion Gate, the premier gate, was once a guarded gate; it leads to the private quarters in the palace premises and is titled 'Lion Gate' to suggest strength. Built during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh (1699\u20131743 AD), it is covered with frescoes; its alignment is zigzag, probably made so from security considerations to attack intruders.\n\n===Fourth courtyard===\nThe fourth courtyard is where the [[Zenana]] (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n; Palace of Man Singh I\n[[File:Amber_Fort_-_Baradhari_pavlion_at_Man_Singh_Palace_Square.jpg|left|thumb|Baradari pavilion at Man Singh I Palace Square.]]\nSouth of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589\u20131614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared [[Baradari (building)|baradari]] or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.<ref name=\"Abram2003\"/>\n\nThe queen mothers and the Raja's consorts lived in this part of the palace in Zanani Deorhi, which also housed their female attendants. The queen mothers took a deep interest in building temples in Amer town.<ref name=Deorhi>{{Cite web|url=https://mysterioustrip.com/amber-fort-palace-jaipur/ |title=Information on Zenani Deorhi |accessdate=22 November 2017 |publisher=mysterioustrip.com }}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nSix forts of Rajasthan, namely, Amber Fort, [[Chittor Fort]], [[Gagron Fort]], [[Jaisalmer Fort]], [[Kumbhalgarh]] and [[Ranthambore Fort]] were included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list during the 37th meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Phnom Penh during June 2013.

The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, there is also a carving of [[Lord Ganesha]], which is made out of a single piece of [[coral]].<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nAnother version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone slab which was said to have a link to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story in which [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had killed older siblings of [[Lord Krishna]] on this stone. In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of [[Durga]] [[Mahishasuramardini]], who had slain the demon king [[Mahishasura]] and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of [[Jamwa Ramgarh|Ramgarh]].<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\nAnother practice that is associated with this temple is the religious rites of animal sacrifice during the festival days of [[Navrathri]] (a nine-day festival celebrated twice a year). The practice was to sacrifice a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and also [[goats]] on the eighth day of the festival in front of the temple, which would be done in the presence of the royal family, watched by a large gathering of devotees. This practice was banned under the law from 1975, after which the sacrifice was held within the palace grounds in Jaipur, strictly as a private event with only the close kin of the royal family watching the event. However, now the practice of animal sacrifice has been totally stopped at the temple premises and offerings made to the goddess are only of the vegetarian type.<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\n===Second courtyard===\nThe second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n===Third courtyard===\n[[File:Amber Fort interior.jpg|thumb|Mirrored ceiling in the Mirror Palace]]\n[[File:Amber Fort - Sheesh Mahal Interior.jpg|thumb|Sheesh Mahal Interior]]\nThe third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the [[Mughal Gardens]]. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir, which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a \"glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight\".<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>  Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in the 16th century and completed in 1727. It is also the foundation year of Jaipur state.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=9&name=Sheesh%20mahal%20Amer%20palace|title = Sheesh mahal Amer palace|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = www.amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit Kumar Pareek and Agam kumar}}</ref> However, most of this work was allowed to deteriorate during the period 1970\u201380 but has since then been in the process of restoration and renovation. The walls around the hall hold carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nOn top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and [[alabaster]] relief work.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\nThe other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a [[sandalwood]] door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|ch\u00een\u00ee kh\u00e2na]]\". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.\n\n; Magic flower\nA particular attraction here is the \"magic flower\" carved marble panel at the base of one of the pillars around the mirror palace depicting two hovering butterflies; the flower has seven unique designs including a fishtail, lotus, hooded cobra, elephant trunk, lion's tail, cob of corn, and scorpion, each one of which is visible by a special way of partially hiding the panel with the hands.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\n; Garden\nThe garden, located between the Jai Mandir on the east and the Sukh Niwas on the west, both built on high platforms in the third courtyard, was built by Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1623\u201368). It is patterned on the lines of the Chahar Bagh or Mughal Garden. It is in a sunken bed, shaped in a hexagonal design. It is laid out with narrow channels lined with marble around a star-shaped pool with a fountain at the center. Water for the garden flows in cascades through channels from the Sukh Niwas and also from the cascade channels called the ''\"chini khana niches\"'' that originate on the terrace of the Jai Mandir.<ref name=\"Ruggles2008\"/>\n\n; Tripolia gate\nTripolia gate means three gates. It is access to the palace from the west. It opens in three directions, one to the Jaleb Chowk, another to the Man Singh Palace and the third one to the Zenana Deorhi on the south.\n\n; Lion gate\nThe Lion Gate, the premier gate, was once a guarded gate; it leads to the private quarters in the palace premises and is titled 'Lion Gate' to suggest strength. Built during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh (1699\u20131743 AD), it is covered with frescoes; its alignment is zigzag, probably made so from security considerations to attack intruders.\n\n===Fourth courtyard===\nThe fourth courtyard is where the [[Zenana]] (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n; Palace of Man Singh I\n[[File:Amber_Fort_-_Baradhari_pavlion_at_Man_Singh_Palace_Square.jpg|left|thumb|Baradari pavilion at Man Singh I Palace Square.]]\nSouth of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589\u20131614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared [[Baradari (building)|baradari]] or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.<ref name=\"Abram2003\"/>\n\nThe queen mothers and the Raja's consorts lived in this part of the palace in Zanani Deorhi, which also housed their female attendants.

The site for the palace was located on the site of a royal hunting lodge on a plain land encircled by a rocky hill range, five miles south of [[Amber (city)]]. The history of the city palace is closely linked with the history of Jaipur city and its rulers, starting with [[Jai Singh II of Amber|Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II]] who ruled from 1699 to 1744. He is credited with initiating construction of the city complex by building the outer wall of the complex spreading over many acres. Initially, he ruled from his capital at Amber, which lies at a distance of {{convert|11|km|mi}} from Jaipur. He shifted his capital from Amber to Jaipur in 1727 because of an increase in population and increasing water shortage. He planned Jaipur city in six blocks separated by broad avenues, on the classical basis of principals of [[Vastushastra]] and another similar classical treatise under the architectural guidance of Vidyadar Bhattacharya, a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] architect from [[Naihati]] of present-day [[West Bengal]] who was initially an accounts-clerk in the Amber treasury and later promoted to the office of Chief Architect by the King.<ref name=Marshall>{{Cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title= World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia  |work=Jaipur|pages=444|accessdate=2009-12-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZBaVhmRvCkC&pg=PA444&dq=City+Palace,+Jaipur&lr=&ei=kwkhS9HUIoyIkwTs0uylCQ&cd=15#v=onepage&q=City%20Palace%2C%20Jaipur&f=false|publisher= Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|isbn=0-7614-7631-8}}</ref><ref name=jaipur>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaipur.org.uk/forts-monuments/city-palace.html|title= City Palace Jaipur|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref><ref name=maps>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/rajasthan/tourism/city-palace-jaipur.html|title= City Palace Jaipur|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref><ref name=\"Brown p.149\">Brown p.149</ref>\n\nFollowing Jai Singh's death in 1857, there were internecine wars among the Rajput kings of the region but cordial relations were maintained with the [[British Raj]]. [[Maharaja]] [[Ram Singh II|Ram Singh]] sided with the British in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] or [[Uprising of 1857]] and established himself with the Imperial rulers. It is to his credit that the city of Jaipur including all of its monuments (including the City Palace) are stucco painted 'Pink' and since then the city has been called the \"Pink City\".The change in colour scheme was as an honour of hospitality extended to the [[Prince of Wales]] (who later became [[King Edward VII]]) on his visit. This colour scheme has since then become a trademark of the Jaipur city.<ref name=\"Brown p.149\"/>\n\n[[Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur|Man Singh II]], the adopted son of [[Maharaja]] Madho Singh II, was the last [[Maharaja of Jaipur]] to rule from the Chandra Mahal palace, in Jaipur.

Two queens wielding full authority were Raja Man Singh of Dhoondhar's Bhati clan wife, and Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner's wife, Rani Ganga Bai.

From within zenanas, these women remained fully informed about their individual jagirs.

Seen at the top is the flag of the royal family.]] \nChandra Mahal is one of the oldest buildings in the City Palace complex. It has seven floors, a number considered auspicious by Rajput rulers. The first two floors consist of the Sukh Niwas (the house of pleasure), followed by the Rang Mahal (alternatively called Shobha Niwas) with coloured glasswork, then Chhavi Niwas with its blue and white decorations. The last two floors are the Shri Niwas, and Mukut Mandir which is literally the crowning pavilion of this palace. The Mukut Mandir, with a ''bangaldar'' roof, has the royal standard of Jaipur hoisted at all times, as well as a quarter flag (underscoring the Sawai in the title) when the Maharaja is in residence.<ref name=\":1\" /> {{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = The Indur Mahal -Chandra Mahal- from the garden, Jeypore.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Chandra Mahal, City Palace, Jaipur.jpg\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Chandra Mahal in 1885 from the Jai Niwas garden.

[[Emperor Aurangzeb]] who attended the wedding of Jai Singh, shook hands with the young groom and wished him well on his marriage. On this occasion, Jai Singh made an irreverent remark to the Emperor stating that the way he had shaken hands with him made it incumbent on the Emperor to protect him (Jai Singh) and his kingdom. Aurangzeb, instead of responding in indignation at the quip, felt pleased and conferred on the young Jai Singh the title of 'Sawai', which means \"one and a quarter\". Since then the Maharajas have pre-fixed their names with this title. During residence there, they also fly a one and a quarter size flag atop their buildings and palaces.<ref name=\"Brown p.149\" />\n\n=== Mubarak Mahal ===\n[[File:City Palace-Jaipur-India0001.JPG|thumb|right|Mubarak Mahal]]\nThe Mubarak Mahal courtyard at the City Palace was fully developed as late as 1900, when the court architect of the time, Lala Chiman Lal, constructed the Mubarak Mahal in its centre. Chiman Lal,  had worked with [[Samuel Swinton Jacob]], the State's executive engineer, and also built the Rajendra Pol around the same time as the Mubarak Mahal, complementing it in style. The facade of the Mubarak Mahal has a hanging balcony and is identical on all four sides, the intricate carving in white ([[Stones of India|andhi marble]]) and beige stone giving it the illusion of delicate decoupage. The Mubarak Mahal was built for receiving foreign guests but it now houses the museum offices and a library on the first floor and the museum's Textile Gallery on the ground floor.<ref name=\"Vibhuti Sachdev 2008\"/><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahapedia.org/jaipur-history-and-architecture|title=Jaipur: History and Architecture {{!}} Sahapedia|website=www.sahapedia.org|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>\n\n=== The Clock Tower ===\n[[File:Clock Tower City Palace Jaipur-1.jpg|thumb|Clock Tower, City Palace, Jaipur]]\nThe clock tower is a structure to the south of the Sabha Niwas. It is a sign of European influence in the Rajput court as the clock was installed in a pre-existing tower in 1873. The clock, purchased from Black and Murray & Co. of Calcutta, aimed to introduce a little Victorian efficiency and punctuality into court proceedings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Galleries of the museum ==\n\n=== Sabha Niwas (Hall of Audience) ===\nThis is the main hall of audience. It is a large room with two thrones at the centre, a set of chairs around, as if in a durbar setting. On the walls of the halls are large format paintings of the Maharajas of Jaipur, a large picchwai (a backdrop for a shrine), large paintings depicting the colourful festival of [[holi]], and a pair of paintings featuring spring and summer (possibly made in the Deccan). On display, you can also see military medals and polo trophies, marking the achievements of the rulers. The room is opulent in its decoration, with murals, and chandeliers. The current closed arches, on which the Holi paintings, and the Spring and Summer portrait hang, were closed in the recent times. Photos from the reign of Man Singh II, of the court in attendance, Lord and Lady Mountbatten's visit, line the corridor leading out to the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard.\n\n=== Textile Gallery ===\nThis gallery is situated on the ground floor of the Mubarak Mahal. On display are various kinds of textiles and fabrics, including Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I's ''atmasukha'', Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh's wedding jama, and a set of robes (''angarakhas'') belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II. Not to be missed is the rare pashmina carpet, made in Lahore or Kashmir around 1650. This gallery also has on display the Polo outfit and cups belonging Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and the billiards outfit of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II.\n\n=== Sileh Khana (Arms and Armour Gallery) ===\nThe Sileh khana showcases the many arms used by the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Jaipur and Amber. The gallery has a variety of swords, guns, powder flasks, shields, helmets, archer's rings, even ivory back-scratching tools! The collection features early 19th century swords with a variety of decorations on the handle as well as sword blade or Shamshir Shikargah. According to Robert Elgood, two of such pieces on display have chiselled animals down the length of the blade (a concept acquired from Europe that allows decoration to a greater effect) the blade has raised figures, buildings, animals and birds all highlighted in gold. There is true damascening in gold on the hilt as well as the blades. These swords were never used and purely made for decorative purposes. The hilts of the pieces displayed are of different styles and can be accurately dated to the workshop set up for Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II ( r. 1880 \u2013 1922).<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Arms & armour at the Jaipur court : the royal collection|author=Elgood, Robert|isbn=9789383098774|oclc=911067516}}</ref>\n\nHighlights of the collection are a tulwar owned by Maharaja Ram Singh Ji II (1835\u201380) (name inscribed on the blade) which had a blade length of 54cms \u2013 bright steel, single-edged khanda blade with ricasso, shallow central fuller, and false edge. The blade is stamped at the forte with a Trishul and is heavier and shorter than normal indicating a special purpose. The gallery also showcases a tulwar which belonged to Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II (1912). The tulwar's hilt has chequered grip and pommel steel inlaid with silver flowers.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAdditionally, a beautifully painted shield featuring the clan goddess, Shila Mata, and hunting scenes, belonged to Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and is an exquisite object of the collection, and a must-see object. The case also has a child's turban in metal which mimics a fabric turban, and is a unique item.\n\nThe armour section showcases helmets \u2013 \u201cKhud\u201d. One of them is a 16th-century watered steel helmet which is rare to find. The helmet has been added with a false damascened band of decoration in the latter years of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II (19th century). Watered steel was extremely expensive and therefore used very sparingly.\n\n=== Painting and photography gallery ===\nOne of the newest galleries at The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum is the Painting and Photography Gallery, where paintings and photographs from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Jaipur are showcased. This gallery highlights the ways in which traditional artistic practices were transformed by political and cultural changes, modern technologies, and new materials.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Museum. |first1=Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II |title=Painting & photography at the Jaipur court |isbn=9385285246}}</ref>\n\nArt historians have subdivided Rajput painting, a form of painting that developed in the sixteenth century, based on the kingdoms from within they emerged: Marwar, Mewar, and [[Dhundhar]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Four centuries of Rajput painting : Mewar, Marwar, and Dhundhar Indian miniatures from the collection of Isabella and Vicky Ducrot |publisher=Skira |isbn=8857200183 |edition=1st}}</ref> Jaipur, the capital of the kingdom of Dhundhar, developed its own unique style of painting.

This collection ranges from the 1860s to the 1950s and is unique due to its association with Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II, who was not only a collector and patron, but also a practitioner of photography.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Painting & Painting Photography|last=Mrinalini Venkateswaran|first=Giles Tillotson|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-93-85285-24-0|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe photographic prints in the collection are mainly [[Albumen print|albumen]] and [[Gelatin silver process|silver gelatin prints]], on both printed and developed out paper. They consist of portraits, landscapes and architectural images and views of the Indian subcontinent by established photographers or studios such as [[Lala Deen Dayal]], Jonston & Hoffman and [[Bourne & Shepherd]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe glass plate negatives are primarily the work of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II or his studio \u2013 the ''tasveerkhana'' \u2013 and are [[Collodion process|wet collodion plates]], which was the dominant technology in use from the 1850s\u20131880s. The bulk of the negatives in the collection are portraits, but they also include numerous landscapes of Jaipur and Amber and art objects such as paintings and sword hilts. The most distinctive part of the collection is the set of wet plate negatives that documents the ''[[zenana]]'' women, offering us a unique insight into the microcosm of the ''zenana''.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe photographic equipment in the collection belonged to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II and it appears to date from the 1860s.

The site for the palace was located on the site of a royal hunting lodge on a plain land encircled by a rocky hill range, five miles south of [[Amber (city)]]. The history of the city palace is closely linked with the history of Jaipur city and its rulers, starting with [[Jai Singh II of Amber|Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II]] who ruled from 1699 to 1744. He is credited with initiating construction of the city complex by building the outer wall of the complex spreading over many acres. Initially, he ruled from his capital at Amber, which lies at a distance of {{convert|11|km|mi}} from Jaipur. He shifted his capital from Amber to Jaipur in 1727 because of an increase in population and increasing water shortage. He planned Jaipur city in six blocks separated by broad avenues, on the classical basis of principals of [[Vastushastra]] and another similar classical treatise under the architectural guidance of Vidyadar Bhattacharya, a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] architect from [[Naihati]] of present-day [[West Bengal]] who was initially an accounts-clerk in the Amber treasury and later promoted to the office of Chief Architect by the King.<ref name=Marshall>{{Cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title= World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia  |work=Jaipur|pages=444|accessdate=2009-12-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZBaVhmRvCkC&pg=PA444&dq=City+Palace,+Jaipur&lr=&ei=kwkhS9HUIoyIkwTs0uylCQ&cd=15#v=onepage&q=City%20Palace%2C%20Jaipur&f=false|publisher= Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|isbn=0-7614-7631-8}}</ref><ref name=jaipur>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaipur.org.uk/forts-monuments/city-palace.html|title= City Palace Jaipur|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref><ref name=maps>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/rajasthan/tourism/city-palace-jaipur.html|title= City Palace Jaipur|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref><ref name=\"Brown p.149\">Brown p.149</ref>\n\nFollowing Jai Singh's death in 1857, there were internecine wars among the Rajput kings of the region but cordial relations were maintained with the [[British Raj]]. [[Maharaja]] [[Ram Singh II|Ram Singh]] sided with the British in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] or [[Uprising of 1857]] and established himself with the Imperial rulers. It is to his credit that the city of Jaipur including all of its monuments (including the City Palace) are stucco painted 'Pink' and since then the city has been called the \"Pink City\".The change in colour scheme was as an honour of hospitality extended to the [[Prince of Wales]] (who later became [[King Edward VII]]) on his visit. This colour scheme has since then become a trademark of the Jaipur city.<ref name=\"Brown p.149\"/>\n\n[[Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur|Man Singh II]], the adopted son of [[Maharaja]] Madho Singh II, was the last [[Maharaja of Jaipur]] to rule from the Chandra Mahal palace, in Jaipur.

Queens \u2013 often the senior-most (''Pat-Rani'') had a say in the governance of the kingdom or estate in the absence of the ruler. Two queens wielding full authority were Raja Man Singh of Dhoondhar's Bhati clan wife, and Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner's wife, Rani Ganga Bai.

Many warrior clan women got lands for their maintenance as personal ''jagirs'' and ''haath-kharch ki jagir''  (personal spending from the province) from both, their natal families, and the families they married into, and administered such lands through personal administrative agents (kamdars, amils, and dewans). From within zenanas, these women remained fully informed about their individual jagirs. Details about crops, law, and order, social problems, appeals from the peasantry, came to them through their stewards or agents, who took instructions directly from the women and were answerable only to them. The women used the revenues from their estates solely as they wished.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Architecture==\nThe City Palace is in the central-northeast part of the Jaipur city, which is laid in a unique pattern with wide avenues.

But it's also one of the most important ritual buildings in the complex, and continues to be so today, representing as it does, \u2018living heritage\u2019. Because of its location between the public areas and the private residence, it has traditionally been used for important private functions like the coronation rituals of the Maharajas of Jaipur.\n\nToday, it continues to be used for royal festivals and celebrations like Dusshera. During Gangaur and Teej, the image of the goddess is placed in her palanquin in the centre of the hall, before being carried in procession around the city. During the harvest festival of Makar Sankranti, paper kites belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II who lived almost 150 years ago are displayed in the centre, and the roof is used for flying kites. It is also used for more modern celebrations like parties and weddings.\n\nThere are two huge sterling silver vessels of {{convert|1.6|m|ft}} height and each with capacity of 4000 litres and weighing {{convert|340|kg|lb}}, on display here. They were made from 14,000 melted silver coins without soldering.

Here, there are four small gates (known as Ridhi Sidhi Pol) that are adorned with themes representing the four seasons and Hindu gods. The gates are the Northeast Peacock Gate (with motifs of peacocks on the doorway) representing autumn and dedicated Lord [[Vishnu]]; the Southeast Lotus Gate (with continual flower and petal pattern) suggestive of summer season and dedicated to Lord [[Parvati|Shiva-Parvati]]; the Northwest Green Gate, also called the Leheriya (meaning: \"waves\") gate, in green colour suggestive of spring and dedicated to Lord [[Ganesha]], and lastly, the Southwest Rose Gate with repeated flower pattern representing winter season and dedicated to Goddess [[Devi]].<ref name=\"Brown p.156\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipurthepinkcity.com/forts_monuments/city_palace/city_palace_jaipur.htm|title=Jaipur the Pink City|accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Chandra Mahal ===\n[[File:Jaipur 03-2016 19 City Palace complex.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Chandra Mahal from the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard. Seen at the top is the flag of the royal family.]] \nChandra Mahal is one of the oldest buildings in the City Palace complex. It has seven floors, a number considered auspicious by Rajput rulers. The first two floors consist of the Sukh Niwas (the house of pleasure), followed by the Rang Mahal (alternatively called Shobha Niwas) with coloured glasswork, then Chhavi Niwas with its blue and white decorations. The last two floors are the Shri Niwas, and Mukut Mandir which is literally the crowning pavilion of this palace. The Mukut Mandir, with a ''bangaldar'' roof, has the royal standard of Jaipur hoisted at all times, as well as a quarter flag (underscoring the Sawai in the title) when the Maharaja is in residence.<ref name=\":1\" /> {{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = The Indur Mahal -Chandra Mahal- from the garden, Jeypore.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Chandra Mahal, City Palace, Jaipur.jpg\n| width2 = 160\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Chandra Mahal in 1885 from the Jai Niwas garden.

[[Emperor Aurangzeb]] who attended the wedding of Jai Singh, shook hands with the young groom and wished him well on his marriage. On this occasion, Jai Singh made an irreverent remark to the Emperor stating that the way he had shaken hands with him made it incumbent on the Emperor to protect him (Jai Singh) and his kingdom. Aurangzeb, instead of responding in indignation at the quip, felt pleased and conferred on the young Jai Singh the title of 'Sawai', which means \"one and a quarter\". Since then the Maharajas have pre-fixed their names with this title. During residence there, they also fly a one and a quarter size flag atop their buildings and palaces.<ref name=\"Brown p.149\" />\n\n=== Mubarak Mahal ===\n[[File:City Palace-Jaipur-India0001.JPG|thumb|right|Mubarak Mahal]]\nThe Mubarak Mahal courtyard at the City Palace was fully developed as late as 1900, when the court architect of the time, Lala Chiman Lal, constructed the Mubarak Mahal in its centre. Chiman Lal,  had worked with [[Samuel Swinton Jacob]], the State's executive engineer, and also built the Rajendra Pol around the same time as the Mubarak Mahal, complementing it in style. The facade of the Mubarak Mahal has a hanging balcony and is identical on all four sides, the intricate carving in white ([[Stones of India|andhi marble]]) and beige stone giving it the illusion of delicate decoupage. The Mubarak Mahal was built for receiving foreign guests but it now houses the museum offices and a library on the first floor and the museum's Textile Gallery on the ground floor.<ref name=\"Vibhuti Sachdev 2008\"/><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahapedia.org/jaipur-history-and-architecture|title=Jaipur: History and Architecture {{!}} Sahapedia|website=www.sahapedia.org|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>\n\n=== The Clock Tower ===\n[[File:Clock Tower City Palace Jaipur-1.jpg|thumb|Clock Tower, City Palace, Jaipur]]\nThe clock tower is a structure to the south of the Sabha Niwas. It is a sign of European influence in the Rajput court as the clock was installed in a pre-existing tower in 1873. The clock, purchased from Black and Murray & Co. of Calcutta, aimed to introduce a little Victorian efficiency and punctuality into court proceedings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Galleries of the museum ==\n\n=== Sabha Niwas (Hall of Audience) ===\nThis is the main hall of audience. It is a large room with two thrones at the centre, a set of chairs around, as if in a durbar setting. On the walls of the halls are large format paintings of the Maharajas of Jaipur, a large picchwai (a backdrop for a shrine), large paintings depicting the colourful festival of [[holi]], and a pair of paintings featuring spring and summer (possibly made in the Deccan). On display, you can also see military medals and polo trophies, marking the achievements of the rulers. The room is opulent in its decoration, with murals, and chandeliers. The current closed arches, on which the Holi paintings, and the Spring and Summer portrait hang, were closed in the recent times. Photos from the reign of Man Singh II, of the court in attendance, Lord and Lady Mountbatten's visit, line the corridor leading out to the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard.\n\n=== Textile Gallery ===\nThis gallery is situated on the ground floor of the Mubarak Mahal. On display are various kinds of textiles and fabrics, including Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I's ''atmasukha'', Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh's wedding jama, and a set of robes (''angarakhas'') belonging to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II. Not to be missed is the rare pashmina carpet, made in Lahore or Kashmir around 1650. This gallery also has on display the Polo outfit and cups belonging Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and the billiards outfit of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II.\n\n=== Sileh Khana (Arms and Armour Gallery) ===\nThe Sileh khana showcases the many arms used by the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Jaipur and Amber. The gallery has a variety of swords, guns, powder flasks, shields, helmets, archer's rings, even ivory back-scratching tools! The collection features early 19th century swords with a variety of decorations on the handle as well as sword blade or Shamshir Shikargah. According to Robert Elgood, two of such pieces on display have chiselled animals down the length of the blade (a concept acquired from Europe that allows decoration to a greater effect) the blade has raised figures, buildings, animals and birds all highlighted in gold. There is true damascening in gold on the hilt as well as the blades. These swords were never used and purely made for decorative purposes. The hilts of the pieces displayed are of different styles and can be accurately dated to the workshop set up for Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II ( r. 1880 \u2013 1922).<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Arms & armour at the Jaipur court : the royal collection|author=Elgood, Robert|isbn=9789383098774|oclc=911067516}}</ref>\n\nHighlights of the collection are a tulwar owned by Maharaja Ram Singh Ji II (1835\u201380) (name inscribed on the blade) which had a blade length of 54cms \u2013 bright steel, single-edged khanda blade with ricasso, shallow central fuller, and false edge. The blade is stamped at the forte with a Trishul and is heavier and shorter than normal indicating a special purpose. The gallery also showcases a tulwar which belonged to Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II (1912). The tulwar's hilt has chequered grip and pommel steel inlaid with silver flowers.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAdditionally, a beautifully painted shield featuring the clan goddess, Shila Mata, and hunting scenes, belonged to Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and is an exquisite object of the collection, and a must-see object. The case also has a child's turban in metal which mimics a fabric turban, and is a unique item.\n\nThe armour section showcases helmets \u2013 \u201cKhud\u201d. One of them is a 16th-century watered steel helmet which is rare to find. The helmet has been added with a false damascened band of decoration in the latter years of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II (19th century). Watered steel was extremely expensive and therefore used very sparingly.\n\n=== Painting and photography gallery ===\nOne of the newest galleries at The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum is the Painting and Photography Gallery, where paintings and photographs from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Jaipur are showcased. This gallery highlights the ways in which traditional artistic practices were transformed by political and cultural changes, modern technologies, and new materials.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Museum. |first1=Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II |title=Painting & photography at the Jaipur court |isbn=9385285246}}</ref>\n\nArt historians have subdivided Rajput painting, a form of painting that developed in the sixteenth century, based on the kingdoms from within they emerged: Marwar, Mewar, and [[Dhundhar]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Four centuries of Rajput painting : Mewar, Marwar, and Dhundhar Indian miniatures from the collection of Isabella and Vicky Ducrot |publisher=Skira |isbn=8857200183 |edition=1st}}</ref> Jaipur, the capital of the kingdom of Dhundhar, developed its own unique style of painting. At the same time, artistic exchanges between the Mughal and Rajput courts led to the development of new hybrid painting styles that brought together regional Indian, Mughal, and Persian traditions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mughal and Rajput painting |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521400279}}</ref> This was especially prevalent within the courts of kingdoms that were closely allied with the Mughal imperial court, such as Amber and Jaipur.\n\nCurrently, there are approximately 3,000 paintings housed in the MSMS II Museum, not including the paintings and manuscripts in the private collection of the royal family of Jaipur and in the kapad-dwara.<ref name=\"Painting and Photography page 12\">{{cite book |last1=Museum. |first1=Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II |title=Painting & photography at the Jaipur court |isbn=9385285246 |page=12}}</ref> These include original Mughal and Deccani paintings, Jaipur copies of Mughal paintings, paintings from other Rajput kingdoms, religious and secular paintings, illustrated manuscripts, small- and large-scale portraits, nature studies, paper-cut collages, and other miscellaneous subjects.<ref name=\"Painting and Photography page 12\"/> Many of these are displayed in the Painting and Photography gallery. One of the most striking paintings in the collection is the artist Sahibram's large-scale composition of the Raas-lila. The painting is based on a re-enactment at the court, in which only women performed, even for the role of Krishna<ref>{{cite book |last1=Museum. |first1=Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II |title=Painting & photography at the Jaipur court|isbn=9385285246 |page=101}}</ref>\n\nThe photography collection at the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum consists of approximately 6,050 photographic prints, 1,941 glass plate negatives and photography equipment. This collection ranges from the 1860s to the 1950s and is unique due to its association with Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II, who was not only a collector and patron, but also a practitioner of photography.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Painting & Painting Photography|last=Mrinalini Venkateswaran|first=Giles Tillotson|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-93-85285-24-0|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe photographic prints in the collection are mainly [[Albumen print|albumen]] and [[Gelatin silver process|silver gelatin prints]], on both printed and developed out paper. They consist of portraits, landscapes and architectural images and views of the Indian subcontinent by established photographers or studios such as [[Lala Deen Dayal]], Jonston & Hoffman and [[Bourne & Shepherd]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe glass plate negatives are primarily the work of Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II or his studio \u2013 the ''tasveerkhana'' \u2013 and are [[Collodion process|wet collodion plates]], which was the dominant technology in use from the 1850s\u20131880s. The bulk of the negatives in the collection are portraits, but they also include numerous landscapes of Jaipur and Amber and art objects such as paintings and sword hilts. The most distinctive part of the collection is the set of wet plate negatives that documents the ''[[zenana]]'' women, offering us a unique insight into the microcosm of the ''zenana''.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe photographic equipment in the collection belonged to Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II and it appears to date from the 1860s. It includes the camera equipment and assorted accessories for practicing the wet plate collodion photography process.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Transport gallery ===\nThis gallery features pre-motorised transport like buggies, palkis, miyana, raths, camel saddles, etc. It is currently closed for renovation.<br />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Clock Tower City Palace Jaipur-2.jpg|Clock Tower City Palace\nFile:City Palace, Jaipur (295132908).jpg|Peacock Gate\nFile:Gardien, City Palace, Jaipur.jpg|Keeper at Rajendra Pol\nFile:Arches and Columns on City Palace's entrance.jpg|Arches and columns on Elevation\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|last=Bindolass|first=Joe|author2=Sarina Singh|title=India|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetindi00sari/page/1236 1236]|url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetindi00sari|url-access=registration|quote=City Palace, Jaipur.|publisher= Lonely Planet|year= 2007|isbn=1-74104-308-5}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Lindsay|author2=Amelia Thomas|title= Rajasthan, Delhi and Agra|pages=420|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz0_zXPb68kC&pg=PA154&dq=City+Palace,+Jaipur&ei=nwYhS9uMCaGykATC_7jNCQ&cd=3#v=onepage&q=City%20Palace%2C%20Jaipur&f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2008|isbn=1-74104-690-4}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title= World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia |pages=1584|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZBaVhmRvCkC&pg=PA444&dq=City+Palace,+Jaipur&lr=&ei=kwkhS9HUIoyIkwTs0uylCQ&cd=15#v=onepage&q=City%20Palace%2C%20Jaipur&f=false|publisher= Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|isbn=0-7614-7631-8}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Matane|first=Paulias|author2=M.

The [[metacarpal bones]] connect the fingers and the [[carpal bones]] of the [[wrist]]. Each human hand has five [[Metacarpal bones|metacarpals]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Marieb|2004| p=237}}</ref> and eight carpal bones.\n\nFingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of [[Touch|tactile]] feedback. They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the [[sense of touch]] is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemisphere]], so that [[handedness]]\u2014the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.\n\nAmong humans, the hands play an important function in [[body language]] and [[sign language]]. Likewise the ten digits of two hands, and the twelve [[phalanges]] of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation technique's\n\n==Structure==\nMany [[mammal]]s and other [[animal]]s have [[prehensility|grasping appendages]] similar in form to a hand such as [[paw]]s, [[claw]]s, and talons, but these are not scientifically considered to be grasping hands. The scientific use of the term ''hand'' in this sense to distinguish the terminations of the front paws from the hind ones is an example of [[anthropomorphism]]. The only true grasping hands appear in the mammalian order of [[primates]]. Hands must also have opposable [[thumb]]s, as described later in the text.\n\nThe hand is located at the distal end of each arm. [[Ape]]s and [[monkey]]s are sometimes described as having four hands, because the toes are long and the [[hallux]] is opposable and looks more like a [[thumb]], thus enabling the feet to be used as hands.\n\nThe word \"hand\" is sometimes used by evolutionary anatomists to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb such as when researching the homology between the three [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]]s of the [[bird]] hand and the [[dinosaur]] hand.<ref name=\"Xing\" />\n\nAn adult human male's hand weighs about a pound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.exrx.net/Kinesiology/Segments|title=ExRx.net : Body Segment Data|website=www.exrx.net}}</ref>\n\n=== Areas ===\n[[File:Hand parts - en.svg|thumb|Human hand parts]]\nAreas of the human hand include:\n*The ''palm'' (Volar), which is the central region of the anterior part of the hand, located superficially to the [[metacarpus]]. The skin in this area contains [[dermal papillae]] to increase friction, such as are also present on the fingers and used for [[fingerprint]]s.\n*The ''opisthenar'' area (dorsal) is the corresponding area on the posterior part of the hand.\n*The ''heel of the hand'' is the area anteriorly to the [[Metacarpus#Base|bases of the metacarpal bones]], located in the proximal part of the palm. It is the area that sustains most pressure when using the palm of the hand for support, such as in [[handstand]].\nThere are five [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] attached to the hand, notably with a [[fingernail|nail]] fixed to the end in place of the normal [[claw]].  The four [[finger]]s can be folded over the palm which allows the grasping of objects. Each finger, starting with the one closest to the thumb, has a colloquial name to distinguish it from the others:\n* [[index finger]], pointer finger, forefinger, or 2nd digit\n* [[middle finger]] or long finger or 3rd digit\n* [[ring finger]] or 4th digit\n* [[little finger]], pinky finger, small finger, baby finger, or 5th digit\n\nThe [[thumb]] (connected to the [[first metacarpal bone]] and [[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]]) is located on one of the sides, parallel to the arm.  A reliable way of identifying human hands is from the presence of opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs are identified by the ability to be brought opposite to the fingers, a muscle action known as opposition.\n\n===Bones===\n[[File:Scheme human hand bones-en.svg|thumb|Bones of the human hand]]\n[[File:Hand-bone animation.gif|thumb|Hand-bone animation]]\nThe [[skeleton]] of the human hand consists of 27 bones:<ref>{{Harvnb|Tubiana|Thomine|Mackin|1998| p=4}}</ref> the eight [[short bone|short]] [[carpal bones]] of the [[wrist]] are organized into a proximal row ([[scaphoid]], [[lunate bone|lunate]], [[triquetral]] and [[pisiform]]) which articulates with the bones of the forearm, and a distal row ([[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]], [[trapezoid bone|trapezoid]], [[capitate]] and [[hamate]]), which articulates with the bases of the five [[Metacarpus|metacarpal bones]] of the hand. The heads of the metacarpals will each in turn articulate with the bases of the proximal [[phalanx bone|phalanx]] of the fingers and thumb. These articulations with the fingers are the [[metacarpophalangeal joints]] known as the knuckles. At the palmar aspect of the first metacarpophalangeal joints are small, almost spherical bones called the sesamoid bones. The fourteen phalanges make up the fingers and thumb, and are numbered I-V (thumb to little finger) when the hand is viewed from an anatomical position (palm up). The four fingers each consist of three phalanx bones: proximal, middle, and distal. The thumb only consists of a proximal and distal phalanx.<ref name=\"Saladin-264\">[Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2007. Print.]</ref> Together with the phalanges of the fingers and thumb these metacarpal bones form five rays or poly-articulated chains.\n\nBecause [[supination]] and [[pronation]] (rotation about the axis of the forearm) are added to the two axes of movements of the wrist, the [[ulna]] and [[Radius (bone)|radius]] are sometimes considered part of the skeleton of the hand.<!-- (no ref) --->\n\nThere are numerous [[sesamoid bone]]s in the hand, small [[ossified]] nodes embedded in tendons; the exact number varies between people:<ref name=\"Schmidt 2003 105\"/> whereas a pair of sesamoid bones are found at virtually all thumb metacarpophalangeal joints, sesamoid bones are also common at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb (72.9%) and at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the little finger (82.5%) and the index finger (48%).  In rare cases, sesamoid bones have been found in all the metacarpophalangeal joints and all distal interphalangeal joints except that of the long finger.\n\nThe articulations are:\n*[[interphalangeal articulations of hand]] (the [[hinge joint]]s between the bones of the digits)\n*[[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s (where the digits meet the palm)\n*[[intercarpal articulations]] (where the palm meets the wrist)\n*[[wrist]] (may also be viewed as belonging to the [[forearm]]).\n\n==== Arches ====\n[[File:Hand-arches.svg|thumb|Arches of the hand<br />Red: one of the oblique arches<br />Brown: one of the longitudinal arches of the digits<br />Dark green: transverse carpal arch<br />Light green: transverse metacarpal arch]]\nThe fixed and mobile parts of the hand adapt to various everyday tasks by forming bony arches: longitudinal arches (the rays formed by the finger bones and their associated metacarpal bones), transverse arches (formed by the carpal bones and distal ends of the metacarpal bones), and oblique arches (between the thumb and four fingers):\n\nOf the longitudinal arches or rays of the hand, that of the thumb is the most mobile (and the least longitudinal).  While the ray formed by the little finger and its associated metacarpal bone still offers some mobility, the remaining rays are firmly rigid.  The phalangeal joints of the index finger, however, offer some independence to its finger, due to the arrangement of its flexor and extension tendons.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\">{{Harvnb|Tubiana|Thomine|Mackin|1998| pp=9\u201314}}</ref>\n\nThe carpal bones form two transversal rows, each forming an arch concave on the palmar side.  Because the proximal arch simultaneously has to adapt to the articular surface of the radius and to the distal carpal row, it is by necessity flexible.  In contrast, the capitate, the \"keystone\" of the distal arch, moves together with the metacarpal bones and the distal arch is therefore rigid.  The stability of these arches is more dependent of the ligaments and capsules of the wrist than of the interlocking shapes of the carpal bones, and the wrist is therefore more stable in flexion than in extension.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\" />  The distal carpal arch affects the function of the CMC joints and the hands, but not the function of the wrist or the proximal carpal arch.  The ligaments that maintain the distal carpal arches are the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|transverse carpal ligament]] and the intercarpal ligaments (also oriented transversally).  These ligaments also form the [[carpal tunnel]] and contribute to the [[deep palmar arch|deep]] and [[superficial palmar arch]]es.  Several muscle tendons attaching to the TCL and the distal carpals also contribute to maintaining the carpal arch.<ref name=\"Austin-319-320\">{{Harvnb|Austin|2005| pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\nCompared to the carpal arches, the arch formed by the distal ends of the metacarpal bones is flexible due to the mobility of the peripheral metacarpals (thumb and little finger).  As these two metacarpals approach each other, the palmar gutter deepens. The central-most metacarpal (middle finger) is the most rigid. It and its two neighbors are tied to the carpus by the interlocking shapes of the metacarpal bones.  The thumb metacarpal only articulates with the trapezium and is therefore completely independent, while the fifth metacarpal (little finger) is semi-independent with the fourth metacarpal (ring finger) which forms a transitional element to the fifth metacarpal.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\" />\n\nTogether with the thumb, the four fingers form four oblique arches, of which the arch of the index finger functionally is the most important, especially for precision grip, while the arch of the little finger contribute an important locking mechanism for power grip.  The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.  Together with the index and middle finger, it forms the dynamic tridactyl configuration responsible for most grips not requiring force.  The ring and little fingers are more static, a reserve ready to interact with the palm when great force is needed.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\" />\n\n{{See also|arches of the foot}}\n\n=== Muscles ===\n{{main|Muscles of the hand}}\n[[File:Wrist and hand deeper palmar dissection.svg|thumb|Muscles and other structures of wrist and palm]]\nThe muscles acting on the hand can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle groups.  The extrinsic muscle groups are the long [[Flexion|flexors]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensors]]. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm.\n\n==== Intrinsic ====\nThe intrinsic muscle groups are the [[thenar]] (thumb) and [[hypothenar]] (little finger) muscles; the [[interosseous muscles of the hand|interosseous muscles]] ([[dorsal interossei of the hand|four dorsally]] and [[palmar interossei muscles|three volarly]]) originating between the metacarpal bones; and the [[lumbricals of the hand|lumbrical muscles]] arising from the [[flexor digitorum profundus muscle|deep flexor]] (and are special because they have no bony origin) to insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.<ref name=\"LHC\">{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/386/intrinsic-muscles-hand | title = Medical mnemonics | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-19 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20110713204529/http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/386/intrinsic-muscles-hand | archivedate = 2011-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n==== Extrinsic ====\n[[File:Wrist extensor compartments (numbered).PNG|thumb|left|Extensor compartments of wrist (back of hand)]]\nThe fingers have two long flexors, located on the underside of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the thenar group ([[opponens pollicis|opponens]] and [[abductor pollicis brevis muscle|abductor brevis muscle]]), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible.\n\nThe extensors are located on the back of the forearm and are connected in a more complex way than the flexors to the dorsum of the fingers. The tendons unite with the interosseous and lumbrical muscles to form the extensorhood mechanism. The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits. The thumb has two extensors in the forearm; the tendons of these form the [[anatomical snuff box]]. Also, the index finger and the little finger have an extra extensor used, for instance, for pointing. The extensors are situated within 6 separate compartments.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Compared to the rest of the body's skin, the hands' palms (as well as the soles of the [[Foot|feet]]) are usually lighter&nbsp;\u2014 and even much lighter in dark-skinned individuals, compared to the other side of the hand. Indeed, genes specifically expressed in the [[dermis]] of palmoplantar skin inhibit [[melanin]] production and thus the ability to [[Sun tanning|tan]], and promote the thickening of the [[stratum lucidum]] and [[stratum corneum]] layers of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. All parts of the skin involved in grasping are covered by papillary ridges ([[fingerprint]]s) acting as friction pads.  In contrast, the hairy skin on the dorsal side is thin, soft, and pliable, so that the skin can recoil when the fingers are stretched.

This development has been accompanied by important changes in the brain and the relocation of the eyes to the front of the face, together allowing the muscle control and [[stereoscopic vision]] necessary for controlled grasping.  This grasping, also known as power grip, is supplemented by the precision grip between the thumb and the distal finger pads made possible by the opposable thumbs.  ''[[Hominidae]]'' (great apes including humans) acquired an erect [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] posture about {{Ma|3.6}}, which freed the hands from the task of locomotion and paved the way for the precision and range of motion in human hands.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Lanz-1\">{{Harvnb|Schmidt|Lanz|2003| p=1}}</ref>\nFunctional analyses of the features unique to the hand of modern humans have shown that they are consistent with the stresses and requirements associated with the effective use of [[paleolithic]] stone tools.<ref>Key and Lycett (2011) Technology based evolution?

The [[metacarpal bones]] connect the fingers and the [[carpal bones]] of the [[wrist]]. Each human hand has five [[Metacarpal bones|metacarpals]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Marieb|2004| p=237}}</ref> and eight carpal bones.\n\nFingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of [[Touch|tactile]] feedback. They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the [[sense of touch]] is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemisphere]], so that [[handedness]]\u2014the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning.\n\nAmong humans, the hands play an important function in [[body language]] and [[sign language]]. Likewise the ten digits of two hands, and the twelve [[phalanges]] of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques.\n\n==Structure==\nMany [[mammal]]s and other [[animal]]s have [[prehensility|grasping appendages]] similar in form to a hand such as [[paw]]s, [[claw]]s, and talons, but these are not scientifically considered to be grasping hands. The scientific use of the term ''hand'' in this sense to distinguish the terminations of the front paws from the hind ones is an example of [[anthropomorphism]]. The only true grasping hands appear in the mammalian order of [[primates]]. Hands must also have opposable [[thumb]]s, as described later in the text.\n\nThe hand is located at the distal end of each arm. [[Ape]]s and [[monkey]]s are sometimes described as having four hands, because the toes are long and the [[hallux]] is opposable and looks more like a [[thumb]], thus enabling the feet to be used as hands.\n\nThe word \"hand\" is sometimes used by evolutionary anatomists to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb such as when researching the homology between the three [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]]s of the [[bird]] hand and the [[dinosaur]] hand.<ref name=\"Xing\" />\n\nAn adult human male's hand weighs about a pound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.exrx.net/Kinesiology/Segments|title=ExRx.net : Body Segment Data|website=www.exrx.net}}</ref>\n\n=== Areas ===\n[[File:Hand parts - en.svg|thumb|Human hand parts]]\nAreas of the human hand include:\n*The ''palm'' (Volar), which is the central region of the anterior part of the hand, located superficially to the [[metacarpus]]. The skin in this area contains [[dermal papillae]] to increase friction, such as are also present on the fingers and used for [[fingerprint]]s.\n*The ''opisthenar'' area (dorsal) is the corresponding area on the posterior part of the hand.\n*The ''heel of the hand'' is the area anteriorly to the [[Metacarpus#Base|bases of the metacarpal bones]], located in the proximal part of the palm. It is the area that sustains most pressure when using the palm of the hand for support, such as in [[handstand]].\nThere are five [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] attached to the hand, notably with a [[fingernail|nail]] fixed to the end in place of the normal [[claw]].  The four [[finger]]s can be folded over the palm which allows the grasping of objects. Each finger, starting with the one closest to the thumb, has a colloquial name to distinguish it from the others:\n* [[index finger]], pointer finger, forefinger, or 2nd digit\n* [[middle finger]] or long finger or 3rd digit\n* [[ring finger]] or 4th digit\n* [[little finger]], pinky finger, small finger, baby finger, or 5th digit\n\nThe [[thumb]] (connected to the [[first metacarpal bone]] and [[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]]) is located on one of the sides, parallel to the arm.  A reliable way of identifying human hands is from the presence of opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs are identified by the ability to be brought opposite to the fingers, a muscle action known as opposition.\n\n===Bones===\n[[File:Scheme human hand bones-en.svg|thumb|Bones of the human hand]]\n[[File:Hand-bone animation.gif|thumb|Hand-bone animation]]\nThe [[skeleton]] of the human hand consists of 27 bones:<ref>{{Harvnb|Tubiana|Thomine|Mackin|1998| p=4}}</ref> the eight [[short bone|short]] [[carpal bones]] of the [[wrist]] are organized into a proximal row ([[scaphoid]], [[lunate bone|lunate]], [[triquetral]] and [[pisiform]]) which articulates with the bones of the forearm, and a distal row ([[trapezium (bone)|trapezium]], [[trapezoid bone|trapezoid]], [[capitate]] and [[hamate]]), which articulates with the bases of the five [[Metacarpus|metacarpal bones]] of the hand. The heads of the metacarpals will each in turn articulate with the bases of the proximal [[phalanx bone|phalanx]] of the fingers and thumb. These articulations with the fingers are the [[metacarpophalangeal joints]] known as the knuckles. At the palmar aspect of the first metacarpophalangeal joints are small, almost spherical bones called the sesamoid bones. The fourteen phalanges make up the fingers and thumb, and are numbered I-V (thumb to little finger) when the hand is viewed from an anatomical position (palm up). The four fingers each consist of three phalanx bones: proximal, middle, and distal. The thumb only consists of a proximal and distal phalanx.<ref name=\"Saladin-264\">[Saladin, Kenneth S. Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2007. Print.]</ref> Together with the phalanges of the fingers and thumb these metacarpal bones form five rays or poly-articulated chains.\n\nBecause [[supination]] and [[pronation]] (rotation about the axis of the forearm) are added to the two axes of movements of the wrist, the [[ulna]] and [[Radius (bone)|radius]] are sometimes considered part of the skeleton of the hand.<!-- (no ref) --->\n\nThere are numerous [[sesamoid bone]]s in the hand, small [[ossified]] nodes embedded in tendons; the exact number varies between people:<ref name=\"Schmidt 2003 105\"/> whereas a pair of sesamoid bones are found at virtually all thumb metacarpophalangeal joints, sesamoid bones are also common at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb (72.9%) and at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the little finger (82.5%) and the index finger (48%).  In rare cases, sesamoid bones have been found in all the metacarpophalangeal joints and all distal interphalangeal joints except that of the long finger.\n\nThe articulations are:\n*[[interphalangeal articulations of hand]] (the [[hinge joint]]s between the bones of the digits)\n*[[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s (where the digits meet the palm)\n*[[intercarpal articulations]] (where the palm meets the wrist)\n*[[wrist]] (may also be viewed as belonging to the [[forearm]]).\n\n==== Arches ====\n[[File:Hand-arches.svg|thumb|Arches of the hand<br />Red: one of the oblique arches<br />Brown: one of the longitudinal arches of the digits<br />Dark green: transverse carpal arch<br />Light green: transverse metacarpal arch]]\nThe fixed and mobile parts of the hand adapt to various everyday tasks by forming bony arches: longitudinal arches (the rays formed by the finger bones and their associated metacarpal bones), transverse arches (formed by the carpal bones and distal ends of the metacarpal bones), and oblique arches (between the thumb and four fingers):\n\nOf the longitudinal arches or rays of the hand, that of the thumb is the most mobile (and the least longitudinal).  While the ray formed by the little finger and its associated metacarpal bone still offers some mobility, the remaining rays are firmly rigid.  The phalangeal joints of the index finger, however, offer some independence to its finger, due to the arrangement of its flexor and extension tendons.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\">{{Harvnb|Tubiana|Thomine|Mackin|1998| pp=9\u201314}}</ref>\n\nThe carpal bones form two transversal rows, each forming an arch concave on the palmar side.  Because the proximal arch simultaneously has to adapt to the articular surface of the radius and to the distal carpal row, it is by necessity flexible.  In contrast, the capitate, the \"keystone\" of the distal arch, moves together with the metacarpal bones and the distal arch is therefore rigid.  The stability of these arches is more dependent of the ligaments and capsules of the wrist than of the interlocking shapes of the carpal bones, and the wrist is therefore more stable in flexion than in extension.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\" />  The distal carpal arch affects the function of the CMC joints and the hands, but not the function of the wrist or the proximal carpal arch.  The ligaments that maintain the distal carpal arches are the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|transverse carpal ligament]] and the intercarpal ligaments (also oriented transversally).  These ligaments also form the [[carpal tunnel]] and contribute to the [[deep palmar arch|deep]] and [[superficial palmar arch]]es.  Several muscle tendons attaching to the TCL and the distal carpals also contribute to maintaining the carpal arch.<ref name=\"Austin-319-320\">{{Harvnb|Austin|2005| pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\nCompared to the carpal arches, the arch formed by the distal ends of the metacarpal bones is flexible due to the mobility of the peripheral metacarpals (thumb and little finger).  As these two metacarpals approach each other, the palmar gutter deepens. The central-most metacarpal (middle finger) is the most rigid. It and its two neighbors are tied to the carpus by the interlocking shapes of the metacarpal bones.  The thumb metacarpal only articulates with the trapezium and is therefore completely independent, while the fifth metacarpal (little finger) is semi-independent with the fourth metacarpal (ring finger) which forms a transitional element to the fifth metacarpal.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\" />\n\nTogether with the thumb, the four fingers form four oblique arches, of which the arch of the index finger functionally is the most important, especially for precision grip, while the arch of the little finger contribute an important locking mechanism for power grip.  The thumb is undoubtedly the \"master digit\" of the hand, giving value to all the other fingers.  Together with the index and middle finger, it forms the dynamic tridactyl configuration responsible for most grips not requiring force.  The ring and little fingers are more static, a reserve ready to interact with the palm when great force is needed.<ref name=\"Tubiana-9\" />\n\n{{See also|arches of the foot}}\n\n=== Muscles ===\n{{main|Muscles of the hand}}\n[[File:Wrist and hand deeper palmar dissection.svg|thumb|Muscles and other structures of wrist and palm]]\nThe muscles acting on the hand can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle groups.  The extrinsic muscle groups are the long [[Flexion|flexors]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensors]]. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm.\n\n==== Intrinsic ====\nThe intrinsic muscle groups are the [[thenar]] (thumb) and [[hypothenar]] (little finger) muscles; the [[interosseous muscles of the hand|interosseous muscles]] ([[dorsal interossei of the hand|four dorsally]] and [[palmar interossei muscles|three volarly]]) originating between the metacarpal bones; and the [[lumbricals of the hand|lumbrical muscles]] arising from the [[flexor digitorum profundus muscle|deep flexor]] (and are special because they have no bony origin) to insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.<ref name=\"LHC\">{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/386/intrinsic-muscles-hand | title = Medical mnemonics | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-19 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20110713204529/http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/386/intrinsic-muscles-hand | archivedate = 2011-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n==== Extrinsic ====\n[[File:Wrist extensor compartments (numbered).PNG|thumb|left|Extensor compartments of wrist (back of hand)]]\nThe fingers have two long flexors, located on the underside of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the thenar group ([[opponens pollicis|opponens]] and [[abductor pollicis brevis muscle|abductor brevis muscle]]), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible.\n\nThe extensors are located on the back of the forearm and are connected in a more complex way than the flexors to the dorsum of the fingers. The tendons unite with the interosseous and lumbrical muscles to form the extensorhood mechanism. The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits. The thumb has two extensors in the forearm; the tendons of these form the [[anatomical snuff box]]. Also, the index finger and the little finger have an extra extensor used, for instance, for pointing. The extensors are situated within 6 separate compartments.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All parts of the skin involved in grasping are covered by papillary ridges ([[fingerprint]]s) acting as friction pads.

This development has been accompanied by important changes in the brain and the relocation of the eyes to the front of the face, together allowing the muscle control and [[stereoscopic vision]] necessary for controlled grasping.  This grasping, also known as power grip, is supplemented by the precision grip between the thumb and the distal finger pads made possible by the opposable thumbs.  ''[[Hominidae]]'' (great apes including humans) acquired an erect [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] posture about {{Ma|3.6}}, which freed the hands from the task of locomotion and paved the way for the precision and range of motion in human hands.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Lanz-1\">{{Harvnb|Schmidt|Lanz|2003| p=1}}</ref>\nFunctional analyses of the features unique to the hand of modern humans have shown that they are consistent with the stresses and requirements associated with the effective use of [[paleolithic]] stone tools.<ref>Key and Lycett (2011) Technology based evolution?

The neural machinery underlying hand movements is a major contributing factor; primates have evolved direct connections between neurons in [[Motor cortex|cortical motor areas]] and spinal [[motoneuron]]s, giving the cerebral cortex [[Reflex arc#Monosynaptic vs. polysynaptic|monosynaptic]] control over the motoneurons of the hand muscles; placing the hands \"closer\" to the brain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flanagan|Johansson|2002}}</ref>\nThe recent evolution of the human hand is thus a direct result of the development of the [[central nervous system]], and the hand, therefore, is a direct tool of our consciousness&nbsp;\u2014 the main source of differentiated tactile sensations&nbsp;\u2014 and a precise working organ enabling gestures&nbsp;\u2014 the expressions of our personalities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Putz|Tuppek|1999}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Goryl nizinny-cropped.JPG\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Ardipithecus Hand.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = A gorilla, a large extant primate with small thumbs, and the hand skeleton of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'', a large Pliocene primate with relatively human-like thumbs\n}}\nThere are nevertheless several [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] features left in the human hand, including [[pentadactyly]] (having five fingers), the hairless skin of the palm and fingers, and the ''[[os centrale]]'' found in human embryos, prosimians, and apes.

In humans, the [[Hallux|big toe]] is thus more derived than the thumb.<ref name=\"Lovejoy-etal\" />\n\nThere is a hypothesis suggesting the form of the modern human hand is especially conducive to the formation of a compact fist, presumably for fighting purposes.

Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.\n\nGlobally, 172 million people globally or 5% of the reported workforce of the world were without a job in 2018, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx?MBI_ID=2&locale=en&_afrLoop=1809645378580656&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26locale%3Den%26_afrLoop%3D1809645378580656%26MBI_ID%3D2%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dsxm9jfbzq_21|title=International Labour Organization: Unemployment rate}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the difficulty to measure the unemployment rate by for example using surveys like in the [[United States]] or through registered unemployed citizens like in some countries in [[Europe]] countries, statistical figures such as the [[employment-to-population ratio]] could be better suited to evaluate the status of the [[workforce]] and the [[economy]] if they would be based on people who are registered as, for example, [[taxpayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/ |title=OECD TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions, types, and theories==\nThe state of being without any work yet looking for work is called unemployment. Economists distinguish between various overlapping types of and theories of unemployment, including [[#Cyclical or Keynesian theory of unemployment|cyclical or Keynesian unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[structural unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment.\n\nThough there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \"[[involuntary unemployment]]\" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of [[frictional unemployment]] is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.\n\nOn the other hand, cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature. However, the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, and classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties.\n\nThe clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those with fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust and so even if all vacancies were to be filled, some unemployed workers would still remain. That happens with cyclical unemployment, as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment, which can boomerang back and exacerbate those macroeconomic forces.\n\n===Classical unemployment===\nClassical, or real-wage, unemployment, occurs when real wages for a job are set above the [[market-clearing]] level, causing the number of job-seekers to exceed the number of vacancies. On the other hand, most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage, many choose to drop out of the labor market and no longer seek employment. That is especially true in countries in which low-income families are supported through public welfare systems. In such cases, wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare. Wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in the above-stated scenario. In addition, consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased [[demand for labor]]. Higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services. Therefore, higher wages increase general consumption and as a result demand for labor increases and unemployment decreases.\n\nMany economists have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation. For example, [[minimum wage]] laws raise the cost of some low-skill laborers above market equilibrium, resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot (as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour).<ref>{{cite book |first=F.

Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may suddenly inhibit aggregate demand and thus inhibit [[labor demand]].\n\n[[Keynesian]] economists, on the other hand, see the lack of supply of jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention. One suggested intervention involves [[deficit spending]] to boost employment and goods demand. Another intervention involves an expansionary [[monetary policy]] to increase  the [[supply of money]], which should reduce [[interest rate]]s, which, in turn, should lead to an increase in non-governmental spending.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|first = Seymour E.\n|last=Harris\n|title=The New Economics: Keynes' Influence on Theory and Public Policy\n|year=2005\n|isbn=978-1-4191-4534-6\n|publisher= Kessinger Publishing}}\n</ref>\n\n===Full unemployment===\n{{Main|Full employment}}\n[[File:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|Short-Run [[Phillips Curve]] before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU).

However, the economy eventually hits an \"[[inflation]] barrier\" that is imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist. Historical experience suggests that low unemployment affects inflation in the short term but not the long term.<ref name=chang>Chang, R. (1997) [https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf \"Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113212953/https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf |date=13 November 2013}} ''Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review'' 1Q97:4\u201313</ref> In the long term, the [[velocity of money]] supply measures such as the MZM (\"money zero maturity\", representing cash and equivalent [[demand deposit]]s) velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment.<ref name=hossfeld>Oliver Hossfeld (2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131113215511/http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/texte/publikationen/forschungspapiere/HOSSFELD_USMONEY_INFERWP_2010-4.pdf \"US Money Demand, Monetary Overhang, and Inflation Prediction\"] ''International Network for Economic Research'' working paper no. 2010.4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZMV |title=MZM velocity |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the [[natural rate of unemployment]]. The \"natural\" rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium, and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates. An alternative technical term for that rate is the [[NAIRU]], the ''Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment''. Whatever its name, demand theory holds that if the unemployment rate gets \"too low,\" inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls (incomes policies).\n\nOne of the major problems with the NAIRU theory is that no one knows exactly what the NAIRU is, and it clearly changes over time.<ref name=chang/> The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, making it hard to use the NAIRU in policy-making.<ref name=hossfeld/>\n\nAnother, normative, definition of full employment might be called the ''ideal'' unemployment rate. It would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency. This type of \"full employment\" unemployment would correspond to only frictional unemployment (excluding that part encouraging the [[McJob]]s management strategy) and so would be very low. However, it would be impossible to attain this full-employment target using only demand-side [[Keynesian]] stimulus without getting below the NAIRU and causing accelerating inflation (absent incomes policies). Training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here.\n\nTo the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with \"full employment.\"<ref name=chang/>\n\n===Structural unemployment===\n{{Main|Structural unemployment}}\n[[File:Okuns law quarterly differences.svg|thumb|[[Okun's Law]] interprets unemployment as a function of the rate of growth in GDP.]]\n[[Structural unemployment]] occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs. Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment except that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to abolish this type of unemployment easily.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from longlasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, and their skills (including [[job hunting|job-searching]] skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to [[homelessness]] and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty.\n\nThat means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained ''high'' demand may ''lower'' structural unemployment. This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of [[path dependence]] or \"[[hysteresis]].\"\n\nMuch ''[[technological unemployment]]'',<ref name=\"Jerome 1934\"/> caused by the replacement of workers by machines might be counted as structural unemployment. Alternatively, technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with the problem suggests that the problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by [[Okun's law]], the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers who are made redundant by the increased labour productivity.\n\nSeasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment since it is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction and migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques. That results in substantial and permanent structural unemployment.\n\n===Frictional unemployment===\n{{Main|Frictional unemployment}}\n[[File:US beveridge 2004 through fall 2010.gif|thumb|The [[Beveridge curve]] of 2004 [[vacancy (economics)|job vacancy]] and unemployment rate from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics.]]\n\nFrictional unemployment is the time period between jobs in which a worker [[search theory|searches]] for or transitions from one job to another. It is sometimes called ''search unemployment'' and can be voluntary, based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are [[heterogeneity in economics|heterogeneous]], and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, work-time, location, seasonal industries, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment.\n\nWorkers and employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away. They will invest some time and effort to find a better match. That is, in fact, beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment by multiple means including providing education, advice, training, and assistance such as [[daycare center]]s.\n\nThe frictions in the [[labour market]] are sometimes illustrated graphically with a [[Beveridge curve]], a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along the curve. An increase or decrease in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards or inwards.\n\n===Hidden unemployment===\nOfficial statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden, or covered, unemployment. That is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of how the statistics are collected. In many countries, only those who have no work but are actively looking for work and/or qualifying for social security benefits are counted as unemployed. Those who have given up looking for work and sometimes those who are on government \"retraining\" programs are not officially counted among the unemployed even though they are not employed. \n\nHidden unemployment often is caused by the state's deliberate manipulations to make statistics about the country look better especially for international propaganda purposes, as wad a common practice in the Soviet Union and its satellite states under the Warsaw Pact. Especially in those countries, it is often referred to as agrarian unemployment since it often occurred in agricultural sectors, mostly in rural areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/finansopedia/inne/hasla/912046,bezrobocie-ukryte.html|title=Bezrobocie ukryte - Encyklopedia Gazety Prawnej|website=forsal.pl|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> It was commonly done in a form of early retirement because of lack of vacant jobs for those who had not reached the retirement age or often a situation in which increasing the number of employees did not increase the production (creating fake vacancies on paper for people with whom they did not know what to do, how to use their potential workforce but not admitting to that inability and paying out the diminutive wages for them to pretend to work and remain silent), thus rendering the overall productivity close to zero. It was a very common problem and one of the main reasons for the economic crisis leading to the common people's strikes that later on led to governments responding with martial law state in places like Poland, and the eventual downfall of USSR and Soviet occupation over the rest of the subjugated states under the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe statistic also does not count the \"[[underemployment|underemployed]],\" yhose working fewer hours than they would prefer or in a job that fails to make good use of their capabilities. In addition, those who are of working age but are currently in full-time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics. Traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering, hunting, herding, and farming in wilderness areas may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics.\n\n===Long-term unemployment===\n'''Long-term unemployment''' (LTU) is defined in [[European Union]] statistics as unemployment lasting for longer than one year (while unemployment lasting over two years is defined as ''very long-term unemployment''). The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), which reports current long-term unemployment rate at 1.9 percent, defines this as unemployment lasting 27 weeks or longer. Long-term unemployment is a component of [[structural unemployment]], which results in long-term unemployment existing in every social group, industry, occupation, and all levels of education.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bivens |first= Josh |last2=Shierholz |first2=Heidi |title=Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |url=http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the European Commission published recommendations on how to reduce long-term unemployment.<ref>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365</ref> These advised governments to:\n\n* encourage long-term unemployed people to '''register''' with an [[Public employment service|employment service]];\n* provide each registered long-term unemployed person with an '''individual in-depth assessment''' to identify their needs and potential within 18 months;\n* offer a tailor-made '''job integration agreement''' (JIA) to all registered long-term unemployed within 18 months. These might include measures such as [[Mentorship|mentoring]], help with [[Job hunting|job search]], [[further education]] and training, support for housing, transport, child and care services and rehabilitation. Each person would have a single point of contact to access this support, which would be implemented in partnership with employers.\n\nIn 2017\u20132019 it implemented the Long-Term Unemployment project to research solutions implemented by EU member states and produce a toolkit<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/esf/transnationality/ltu-project</ref> to guide government action.

According to [[Karl Marx]], unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected.

Retrieved 22 July 2007.</ref>\n* ''Labour Force Sample Surveys'' are the most preferred method of unemployment rate calculation since they give the most comprehensive results and enables calculation of unemployment by different group categories such as race and gender. This method is the most internationally comparable.\n* ''Official Estimates'' are determined by a combination of information from one or more of the other three methods. The use of this method has been declining in favor of labour surveys.\n* ''Social Insurance Statistics'', such as unemployment benefits, are computed base on the number of persons insured representing the total labour force and the number of persons who are insured that are collecting benefits. This method has been heavily criticized because if the expiration of benefits before the person finds work.\n* ''Employment Office Statistics'' are the least effective since they include only a monthly tally of unemployed persons who enter employment offices. This method also includes those who are not unemployed by the ILO definition.\n\nThe primary measure of unemployment, U3, allows for comparisons between countries. Unemployment differs from country to country and across different time periods. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States had lower unemployment levels than many countries in the [[European Union]],<ref>Schmitt, John; Rho, Hye Jin; Fremstad, Shawn.

That can impact non-industrialized economies, such as the United States and Europe in the early 19th century, since overall unemployment was approximately 3% because so many individuals were self-employed, independent farmers; however, non-agricultural unemployment was as high as 80%.<ref name=\"Lebergott1964\"/>\n\nMany economies industrialize and so experience increasing numbers of non-agricultural workers. For example, the United States' non-agricultural labour force increased from 20% in 1800 to 50% in 1850 and  97% in 2000.<ref name=\"Lebergott1964\"/> The shift away from self-employment increases the percentage of the population that is included in unemployment rates. When unemployment rates between countries or time periods are compared, it is best to consider differences in their levels of industrialization and self-employment.\n\nAdditionally, the measures of employment and unemployment may be \"too high.\" In some countries, the availability of [[unemployment benefits]] can inflate statistics by giving an incentive to register as unemployed. People who do not seek work may choose to declare themselves unemployed to get benefits; people with undeclared paid occupations may try to get unemployment benefits in addition to the money that they earn from their work.<ref name=\"Reporting benefit fraud.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10014876 |title=Reporting benefit fraud |publisher=Directgov |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the European Union, unemployment is measured using a sample survey (akin to a [[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll).<ref name=\"ilo.org\"/> According to the BLS, a number of Eastern European nations have instituted labour force surveys as well. The sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample, rather than a census.\n\nIt is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ILO definitions by being outside of the \"labour force.\"<ref name=\"sfgate.com\"/> Such people have no job and are not looking for one. Many of them go to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labour force. Still others have a physical or mental disability that prevents them from participating in the labour force. Some people simply elect not to work and prefer to be dependent on others for sustenance.\n\nTypically, employment and the labour force include only work that is done for monetary gain. Hence, a [[homemaker]] is neither part of the labour force nor unemployed. Also, full-time students and prisoners are considered to be neither part of the labour force nor unemployed.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/> The number of prisoners can be important. In 1999, economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the United States by 0.17% between 1985 and the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/>\n\nIn particular, as of 2005, roughly 0.7% of the US population is incarcerated (1.5% of the available working population). Additionally, children, the elderly, and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labour force and so are not included in the unemployment statistics. However, some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labour market.\n\nIn the early stages of an [[boom and bust|economic boom]], unemployment often rises.<ref name=\"Keynes 2007\"/> That is because people join the labour market (give up studying, start a job hunt, etc.) as a result of the improving job market, but until they have actually found a position, they are counted as unemployed. Similarly, during a [[recession]], the increase in the unemployment rate is moderated by people leaving the labour force or being otherwise discounted from the labour force, such as with the self-employed.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2004, according to [[OECD]] ([http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/30/35024561.pdf Employment Outlook 2005] {{ISBN|92-64-01045-9}}), normalized unemployment for men aged 25 to 54 was 4.6% in the US and 7.4% in France. At the same time and for the same population, the employment rate (number of workers divided by population) was 86.3% in the US and 86.7% in France. That example shows that the unemployment rate was 60% higher in France than in the US, but more people in that demographic were working in France than in the US, which is counterintuitive if it is expected that the unemployment rate reflects the health of the labour market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Dean|url=http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&year=2007&base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&162#comment-1679545|title=Wall Street Journal Gets German Unemployment Wrong|work=The American Prospect|access-date=1 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033323/http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&year=2007&base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&162#comment-1679545|archive-date=30 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Raymond Torres, OECD head of Employment Analysis, [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-917229@51-628862,0.html Avec 1,2 % de baisse fin avril, le taux de ch\u00f4mage continue sa d\u00e9crue]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Le Monde'', 30 mai 2007 : ''unemployment measure is less and less meaningful to measure labour market efficiency.''</ref>\n\nThose deficiencies make many [[labour economics|labour market]] economists prefer to look at a range of economic statistics such as labour market participation rate, the percentage of people between 15 and 64 who are currently employed or searching for employment, the total number of full-time jobs in an economy, the number of people seeking work as a raw number and not a percentage, and the total number of person-hours worked in a month compared to the total number of person-hours people would like to work.

Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.]]\nThe labor force participation rate is the ratio between the [[labor force]] and the overall size of their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (national population of the same age range). In the West, during the later half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly because of an increase in the number of women entering the workplace.\n\nIn the United States, there have been four significant stages of women's participation in the labour force: increases in the 20th century and decreases in the 21st century. Male labor force participation decreased from 1953 to 2013. Since October 2013, men have been increasingly joining the labour force.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to the 1920s, very few women worked outside the home. They were young single women who typically withdrew from the labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes. Such women worked primarily in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry or as [[domestic worker]]s. That profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily because of the increased demand for office workers, women's participation in the high school movement, and [[electrification]], which reduced the time that was spent on household chores. Between the 1950s to the early 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians ([[pink-collar]] jobs).\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by various factors, many of which arose from the [[second-wave feminism]] movement. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force by investing in more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the female labor force participation rate rose from approximately 33% in 1948 to a peak of 60.3% in 2000. As of April 2015, the female labor force participation is at 56.6%, the male labor force participation rate is at 69.4%, and the total is 62.8%.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\">[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS11300002 Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women] Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</ref>\n\nA common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the US labor force in the 1950s to the 1990s was caused by the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], as well as the adjustment of [[age of majority]] laws. The use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and to advance their career while they maintained a relationship. By having control over the timing of their fertility, they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill.\n\nThat implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers. One factor may be that more and more men delayed the age of marriage, which allowef women to marry later in life without them worrying about the quality of older men. Other factors include the changing nature of work, with machines replacing physical labor, which eliminated many traditional male occupations, and the rise of the service sector in which many jobs are gender neutral.\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the trend was the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the labor force participation began to reverse its long period of increase. Reasons for the change include a rising share of older workers, an increase in school enrollment rates among young workers, and a decrease in female labor force participation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Zandweghe|first=Willem|title=Interpreting the Recent Decline in Labor Force Participation|journal=KC Fed Economic Review, First Quarter, 2012|pages=5\u201334|url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/pdf/12q1VanZandweghe.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe labor force participation rate can decrease when the rate of growth of the population outweighs that of the employed and the unemployed together.

However, since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, those jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes. (They are often held short-term, either by students or by those trying to gain experience; turnover in most low-paying jobs is high.)\n\nAnother cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment, lack of financial resources, and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents. Unemployment can cause [[underemployment]], and fear of job loss can spur psychological anxiety. As well as anxiety, it can cause depression, lack of confidence, and huge amounts of stress, which is increased when the unemployed are faced with health issues, poverty, and lack of relational support.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Unemployment and underemployment: A narrative analysis about loss|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236855506|journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior|pages = 256\u2013265|volume = 82|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jvb.2013.02.005|first = David L.|last = Blustein|first2 = Saliha|last2 = Kozan|first3 = Alice|last3 = Connors-Kellgren|year = 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother personal cost of unemployment is its impact on relationships.

Employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive. The higher wages perpetuate unemployment, but the threat of unemployment reduces shirking.\n\nBefore current levels of world trade were developed, unemployment was shown to reduce inflation, following the [[Phillips curve]], or to decelerate inflation, following the NAIRU/[[natural rate of unemployment]] theory since it is relatively easy to seek a new job without losing a current job. When more jobs are available for fewer workers (lower unemployment), that may allow workers to find the jobs that better fit their tastes, talents and needs.\n\nAs in the Marxian theory of unemployment, [[special interests]] may also benefit. Some employers may expect that employees with no fear of losing their jobs will not work as hard or will demand increased wages and benefit. According to that theory, unemployment may promote general labour [[productivity]] and [[profit (economics)|profitability]] by increasing employers' rationale for their [[monopsony]]-like power (and profits).<ref name=\"Marx 1863 478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300\">{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Theorien \u00fcber den Mehrwert (Theory of Surplus Value)|year=1863|pages=478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me26/me26b471.htm}}</ref>\n\nOptimal unemployment has also been defended as an environmental tool to brake the constantly-accelerated growth of the GDP to maintain levels that are sustainable in the context of resource constraints and environmental impacts.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = O'Sullivan\n| first = Arthur\n| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | authorlink2 = Steven M.

The demand for labour in an economy is derived from the demand for goods and services. As such, if the demand for goods and services in the economy increases, the demand for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.\n\nThere are many ways to stimulate demand for goods and services. Increasing wages to the working class (those more likely to spend the increased funds on goods and services, rather than various types of savings or commodity purchases) is one theory thaf is proposed. Increased wages are believed to be more effective in boosting demand for goods and services than central banking strategies, which put the increased money supply mostly into the hands of wealthy persons and institutions. Monetarists suggest that increasing money supply in general increases short-term demand. As for the long-term demand, the increased demand is negated by inflation. A rise in fiscal expenditures is another strategy for boosting aggregate demand.\n\nProviding aid to the unemployed is a strategy that is used to prevent cutbacks in consumption of goods and services, which can lead to a vicious cycle of further job losses and further decreases in consumption and demand. Many countries aid the unemployed through social [[welfare]] programs. Such unemployment benefits include [[unemployment insurance]], [[unemployment compensation]], welfare, and subsidies to aid in retraining. The main goal of such programs is to alleviate short-term hardships and, more importantly, to allow workers more time to search for a job.\n\nA direct demand-side solution to unemployment is government-funded employment of the able-bodied poor. This was notably implemented in Britain from the 17th century until 1948 in the institution of the [[workhouse]], which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use. A modern alternative is a [[job guarantee]] in which the government guarantees work at a living wage.\n\nTemporary measures can include [[public works]] programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Government-funded employment is not widely advocated as a solution to unemployment except in times of crisis. That is attributed to the public sector jobs' existence depending directly on the tax receipts from private sector employment.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Top 10%.jpg|thumb|Supply-side economics proposes that lower taxes lead to employment growth. Historical state data from the United States shows a heterogeneous result.]]\n\nIn the US, the unemployment insurance allowance is based solely on previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.) and usually compensates for one third of previous income. To qualify, people must reside in their respective state for at least a year and work. The system was established by the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935. Although 90% of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance, less than 40% apply for and receive benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=Introduction to Unemployment Insurance|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1466#_ftn2|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=2008-12-15}}</ref> However, the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions. For highly-seasonal industries, the system provides income to workers during the off-season, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Bottom 90% v2.jpg|thumb|Tax decreases on high income earners (top 10%) are not correlated with employment growth, but tax decreases on lower-income earners (bottom 90%) are correlated with employment growth.<ref name=\"economix.blogs.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/tax-cuts-for-job-creators/ | work=The New York Times | title=Tax Cuts for Job Creators | date=19 October 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nAccording to classical economic theory, markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand; everyone who wants to sell at the market price can do so. Those who do not want to sell at that price do not; in the labour market, this is classical unemployment. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short-term growth in the economy, increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment.\n\n===Supply-side solutions===\nHowever, the labor market is not 100% efficient although it may be more efficient than the bureaucracy. Some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling, which means that too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot. That assumes [[perfect competition]] exists in the labour market, specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels and that employees are similar in ability.\n\nAdvocates of [[supply-side]] policies believe those policies can solve the problem by making the labour market more flexible. These include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions. Supply-siders argue that their reforms increase long-term growth by reducing labour costs. The increased supply of goods and services requires more workers, increasing employment. It is argued that supply-side policies, which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation, create jobs, reduce unemployment, and decrease labor's share of national income. Other supply-side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], 1931]]\nThere are relatively limited historical records on unemployment because it has not always been acknowledged or measured systematically. Industrialization involves [[economies of scale]], which often prevent individuals from having the capital to create their own jobs to be self-employed. An individual who cannot join an enterprise or create a job is unemployed. As individual farmers, ranchers, spinners, doctors and merchants are organized into large enterprises, those who cannot join or compete become unemployed.\n\nRecognition of unemployment occurred slowly as economies across the world industrialized and bureaucratized. Before then, traditional [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]] native societies have no concept of unemployment. The recognition of the concept of \"unemployment\" is best exemplified through the well documented historical records in England. For example, in 16th-century England no distinction was made between [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and the jobless; both were simply categorized as \"[[sturdy beggar]]s\", who were to be punished and moved on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |title=Sturdy Beggars |publisher=Probertencyclopaedia.com |accessdate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180220/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe closing of the [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 1530s increased [[poverty]], as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped the poor. In addition, there was a significant rise in [[enclosures]] during the [[Tudor period]]. Also, the population was rising. Those unable to find work had a stark choice: starve or break the law. In 1535, a bill was drawn up calling for the creation of a system of [[public works]], which were to deal with the problem of unemployment and to be funded by a tax on income and capital.

Furthermore, the [[monetary authority]] of a country, such as the [[central bank]], can influence the availability and cost for money through its [[monetary policy]].\n\nIn addition to theories of unemployment, a few categorisations of unemployment are used for more precisely [[Conceptual model|modelling]] the effects of unemployment within the economic system. Some of the main types of unemployment include [[structural unemployment]], [[frictional unemployment]], [[cyclical unemployment]], [[involuntary unemployment]] and [[classical unemployment]]. [[Unemployment types#Structural unemployment|Structural unemployment]] focuses on foundational problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labor markets, including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill sets. Structural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]] and [[globalization]]. Discussions of [[frictional unemployment]] focus on voluntary decisions to work based on individuals' valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates added to the time and effort required to find a job. Causes and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage rates.\n\nGlobally, 172 million people globally or 5% of the reported workforce of the world were without a job in 2018, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page3.jspx?MBI_ID=2&locale=en&_afrLoop=1809645378580656&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26locale%3Den%26_afrLoop%3D1809645378580656%26MBI_ID%3D2%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dsxm9jfbzq_21|title=International Labour Organization: Unemployment rate}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the difficulty to measure the unemployment rate by for example using surveys like in the [[United States]] or through registered unemployed citizens like in some countries in [[Europe]] countries, statistical figures such as the [[employment-to-population ratio]] could be better suited to evaluate the status of the [[workforce]] and the [[economy]] if they would be based on people who are registered as, for example, [[taxpayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/crs-implementation-and-assistance/tax-identification-numbers/ |title=OECD TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions, types, and theories==\nThe state of being without any work yet looking for work is called unemployment.

Some additional types of unemployment that are occasionally mentioned are seasonal unemployment, hardcore unemployment, and hidden unemployment.\n\nThough there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \"[[involuntary unemployment]]\" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of [[frictional unemployment]] is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.\n\nOn the other hand, cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and classical unemployment are largely involuntary in nature. However, the existence of structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, and classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties.\n\nThe clearest cases of involuntary unemployment are those with fewer job vacancies than unemployed workers even when wages are allowed to adjust and so even if all vacancies were to be filled, some unemployed workers would still remain. That happens with cyclical unemployment, as macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment, which can boomerang back and exacerbate those macroeconomic forces.\n\n===Classical unemployment===\nClassical, or real-wage, unemployment, occurs when real wages for a job are set above the [[market-clearing]] level, causing the number of job-seekers to exceed the number of vacancies. On the other hand, most economists argue that as wages fall below a livable wage, many choose to drop out of the labor market and no longer seek employment. That is especially true in countries in which low-income families are supported through public welfare systems. In such cases, wages would have to be high enough to motivate people to choose employment over what they receive through public welfare. Wages below a livable wage are likely to result in lower labor market participation in the above-stated scenario. In addition, consumption of goods and services is the primary driver of increased [[demand for labor]]. Higher wages lead to workers having more income available to consume goods and services. Therefore, higher wages increase general consumption and as a result demand for labor increases and unemployment decreases.\n\nMany economists have argued that unemployment increases with increased governmental regulation. For example, [[minimum wage]] laws raise the cost of some low-skill laborers above market equilibrium, resulting in increased unemployment as people who wish to work at the going rate cannot (as the new and higher enforced wage is now greater than the value of their labour).<ref>{{cite book |first=F.

Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may suddenly inhibit aggregate demand and thus inhibit [[labor demand]].\n\n[[Keynesian]] economists, on the other hand, see the lack of supply of jobs as potentially resolvable by government intervention. One suggested intervention involves [[deficit spending]] to boost employment and goods demand. Another intervention involves an expansionary [[monetary policy]] to increase  the [[supply of money]], which should reduce [[interest rate]]s, which, in turn, should lead to an increase in non-governmental spending.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|first = Seymour E.\n|last=Harris\n|title=The New Economics: Keynes' Influence on Theory and Public Policy\n|year=2005\n|isbn=978-1-4191-4534-6\n|publisher= Kessinger Publishing}}\n</ref>\n\n===Full unemployment===\n{{Main|Full employment}}\n[[File:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|Short-Run [[Phillips Curve]] before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU).

However, the economy eventually hits an \"[[inflation]] barrier\" that is imposed by the four other kinds of unemployment to the extent that they exist. Historical experience suggests that low unemployment affects inflation in the short term but not the long term.<ref name=chang>Chang, R. (1997) [https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf \"Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113212953/https://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/ACFC7.pdf |date=13 November 2013}} ''Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review'' 1Q97:4\u201313</ref> In the long term, the [[velocity of money]] supply measures such as the MZM (\"money zero maturity\", representing cash and equivalent [[demand deposit]]s) velocity is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment.<ref name=hossfeld>Oliver Hossfeld (2010) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131113215511/http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/texte/publikationen/forschungspapiere/HOSSFELD_USMONEY_INFERWP_2010-4.pdf \"US Money Demand, Monetary Overhang, and Inflation Prediction\"] ''International Network for Economic Research'' working paper no. 2010.4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZMV |title=MZM velocity |publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome demand theory economists see the inflation barrier as corresponding to the [[natural rate of unemployment]]. The \"natural\" rate of unemployment is defined as the rate of unemployment that exists when the labour market is in equilibrium, and there is pressure for neither rising inflation rates nor falling inflation rates. An alternative technical term for that rate is the [[NAIRU]], the ''Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment''. Whatever its name, demand theory holds that if the unemployment rate gets \"too low,\" inflation will accelerate in the absence of wage and price controls (incomes policies).\n\nOne of the major problems with the NAIRU theory is that no one knows exactly what the NAIRU is, and it clearly changes over time.<ref name=chang/> The margin of error can be quite high relative to the actual unemployment rate, making it hard to use the NAIRU in policy-making.<ref name=hossfeld/>\n\nAnother, normative, definition of full employment might be called the ''ideal'' unemployment rate. It would exclude all types of unemployment that represent forms of inefficiency. This type of \"full employment\" unemployment would correspond to only frictional unemployment (excluding that part encouraging the [[McJob]]s management strategy) and so would be very low. However, it would be impossible to attain this full-employment target using only demand-side [[Keynesian]] stimulus without getting below the NAIRU and causing accelerating inflation (absent incomes policies). Training programs aimed at fighting structural unemployment would help here.\n\nTo the extent that hidden unemployment exists, it implies that official unemployment statistics provide a poor guide to what unemployment rate coincides with \"full employment.\"<ref name=chang/>\n\n===Structural unemployment===\n{{Main|Structural unemployment}}\n[[File:Okuns law quarterly differences.svg|thumb|[[Okun's Law]] interprets unemployment as a function of the rate of growth in GDP.]]\n[[Structural unemployment]] occurs when a labour market is unable to provide jobs for everyone who wants one because there is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for the available jobs. Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment except that it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to abolish this type of unemployment easily.\n\nStructural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from longlasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, and their skills (including [[job hunting|job-searching]] skills) become \"rusty\" and obsolete. Problems with debt may lead to [[homelessness]] and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty.\n\nThat means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained ''high'' demand may ''lower'' structural unemployment. This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of [[path dependence]] or \"[[hysteresis]].\"\n\nMuch ''[[technological unemployment]]'',<ref name=\"Jerome 1934\"/> caused by the replacement of workers by machines might be counted as structural unemployment. Alternatively, technological unemployment might refer to the way in which steady increases in labour productivity mean that fewer workers are needed to produce the same level of output every year. The fact that aggregate demand can be raised to deal with the problem suggests that the problem is instead one of cyclical unemployment. As indicated by [[Okun's law]], the demand side must grow sufficiently quickly to absorb not only the growing labour force but also the workers who are made redundant by the increased labour productivity.\n\nSeasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment since it is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction and migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \"seasonal adjustment\" techniques. That results in substantial and permanent structural unemployment.\n\n===Frictional unemployment===\n{{Main|Frictional unemployment}}\n[[File:US beveridge 2004 through fall 2010.gif|thumb|The [[Beveridge curve]] of 2004 [[vacancy (economics)|job vacancy]] and unemployment rate from the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics.]]\n\nFrictional unemployment is the time period between jobs in which a worker [[search theory|searches]] for or transitions from one job to another. It is sometimes called ''search unemployment'' and can be voluntary, based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are [[heterogeneity in economics|heterogeneous]], and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, work-time, location, seasonal industries, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment.\n\nWorkers and employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away. They will invest some time and effort to find a better match. That is, in fact, beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment by multiple means including providing education, advice, training, and assistance such as [[daycare center]]s.\n\nThe frictions in the [[labour market]] are sometimes illustrated graphically with a [[Beveridge curve]], a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a correlation between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labour cause movements along the curve. An increase or decrease in labour market frictions will shift the curve outwards or inwards.\n\n===Hidden unemployment===\nOfficial statistics often underestimate unemployment rates because of hidden, or covered, unemployment. That is the unemployment of potential workers that are not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of how the statistics are collected. In many countries, only those who have no work but are actively looking for work and/or qualifying for social security benefits are counted as unemployed. Those who have given up looking for work and sometimes those who are on government \"retraining\" programs are not officially counted among the unemployed even though they are not employed. \n\nHidden unemployment often is caused by the state's deliberate manipulations to make statistics about the country look better especially for international propaganda purposes, as wad a common practice in the Soviet Union and its satellite states under the Warsaw Pact. Especially in those countries, it is often referred to as agrarian unemployment since it often occurred in agricultural sectors, mostly in rural areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forsal.pl/finansopedia/inne/hasla/912046,bezrobocie-ukryte.html|title=Bezrobocie ukryte - Encyklopedia Gazety Prawnej|website=forsal.pl|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> It was commonly done in a form of early retirement because of lack of vacant jobs for those who had not reached the retirement age or often a situation in which increasing the number of employees did not increase the production (creating fake vacancies on paper for people with whom they did not know what to do, how to use their potential workforce but not admitting to that inability and paying out the diminutive wages for them to pretend to work and remain silent), thus rendering the overall productivity close to zero. It was a very common problem and one of the main reasons for the economic crisis leading to the common people's strikes that later on led to governments responding with martial law state in places like Poland, and the eventual downfall of USSR and Soviet occupation over the rest of the subjugated states under the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe statistic also does not count the \"[[underemployment|underemployed]],\" yhose working fewer hours than they would prefer or in a job that fails to make good use of their capabilities. In addition, those who are of working age but are currently in full-time education are usually not considered unemployed in government statistics. Traditional unemployed native societies who survive by gathering, hunting, herding, and farming in wilderness areas may or may not be counted in unemployment statistics.\n\n===Long-term unemployment===\n'''Long-term unemployment''' (LTU) is defined in [[European Union]] statistics as unemployment lasting for longer than one year (while unemployment lasting over two years is defined as ''very long-term unemployment''). The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), which reports current long-term unemployment rate at 1.9 percent, defines this as unemployment lasting 27 weeks or longer. Long-term unemployment is a component of [[structural unemployment]], which results in long-term unemployment existing in every social group, industry, occupation, and all levels of education.<ref>{{Citation |last=Bivens |first= Josh |last2=Shierholz |first2=Heidi |title=Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High |publisher=Economic Policy Institute |url=http://www.epi.org/publication/lagging-demand-is-behind-high-long-term-unemployment/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the European Commission published recommendations on how to reduce long-term unemployment.<ref>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016H0220%2801%29&qid=1456753373365</ref> These advised governments to:\n\n* encourage long-term unemployed people to '''register''' with an [[Public employment service|employment service]];\n* provide each registered long-term unemployed person with an '''individual in-depth assessment''' to identify their needs and potential within 18 months;\n* offer a tailor-made '''job integration agreement''' (JIA) to all registered long-term unemployed within 18 months. These might include measures such as [[Mentorship|mentoring]], help with [[Job hunting|job search]], [[further education]] and training, support for housing, transport, child and care services and rehabilitation. Each person would have a single point of contact to access this support, which would be implemented in partnership with employers.\n\nIn 2017\u20132019 it implemented the Long-Term Unemployment project to research solutions implemented by EU member states and produce a toolkit<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/esf/transnationality/ltu-project</ref> to guide government action.

According to [[Karl Marx]], unemployment is inherent within the unstable capitalist system and periodic crises of mass unemployment are to be expected.

Retrieved 22 July 2007.</ref>\n* ''Labour Force Sample Surveys'' are the most preferred method of unemployment rate calculation since they give the most comprehensive results and enables calculation of unemployment by different group categories such as race and gender. This method is the most internationally comparable.\n* ''Official Estimates'' are determined by a combination of information from one or more of the other three methods. The use of this method has been declining in favor of labour surveys.\n* ''Social Insurance Statistics'', such as unemployment benefits, are computed base on the number of persons insured representing the total labour force and the number of persons who are insured that are collecting benefits. This method has been heavily criticized because if the expiration of benefits before the person finds work.\n* ''Employment Office Statistics'' are the least effective since they include only a monthly tally of unemployed persons who enter employment offices. This method also includes those who are not unemployed by the ILO definition.\n\nThe primary measure of unemployment, U3, allows for comparisons between countries. Unemployment differs from country to country and across different time periods. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States had lower unemployment levels than many countries in the [[European Union]],<ref>Schmitt, John; Rho, Hye Jin; Fremstad, Shawn.

That can impact non-industrialized economies, such as the United States and Europe in the early 19th century, since overall unemployment was approximately 3% because so many individuals were self-employed, independent farmers; however, non-agricultural unemployment was as high as 80%.<ref name=\"Lebergott1964\"/>\n\nMany economies industrialize and so experience increasing numbers of non-agricultural workers. For example, the United States' non-agricultural labour force increased from 20% in 1800 to 50% in 1850 and  97% in 2000.<ref name=\"Lebergott1964\"/> The shift away from self-employment increases the percentage of the population that is included in unemployment rates. When unemployment rates between countries or time periods are compared, it is best to consider differences in their levels of industrialization and self-employment.\n\nAdditionally, the measures of employment and unemployment may be \"too high.\" In some countries, the availability of [[unemployment benefits]] can inflate statistics by giving an incentive to register as unemployed. People who do not seek work may choose to declare themselves unemployed to get benefits; people with undeclared paid occupations may try to get unemployment benefits in addition to the money that they earn from their work.<ref name=\"Reporting benefit fraud.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/BenefitsTaxCreditsAndOtherSupport/BenefitFraud/DG_10014876 |title=Reporting benefit fraud |publisher=Directgov |accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the European Union, unemployment is measured using a sample survey (akin to a [[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll).<ref name=\"ilo.org\"/> According to the BLS, a number of Eastern European nations have instituted labour force surveys as well. The sample survey has its own problems because the total number of workers in the economy is calculated based on a sample, rather than a census.\n\nIt is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ILO definitions by being outside of the \"labour force.\"<ref name=\"sfgate.com\"/> Such people have no job and are not looking for one. Many of them go to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labour force. Still others have a physical or mental disability that prevents them from participating in the labour force. Some people simply elect not to work and prefer to be dependent on others for sustenance.\n\nTypically, employment and the labour force include only work that is done for monetary gain. Hence, a [[homemaker]] is neither part of the labour force nor unemployed. Also, full-time students and prisoners are considered to be neither part of the labour force nor unemployed.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/> The number of prisoners can be important. In 1999, economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the United States by 0.17% between 1985 and the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Krueger 1999\"/>\n\nIn particular, as of 2005, roughly 0.7% of the US population is incarcerated (1.5% of the available working population). Additionally, children, the elderly, and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labour force and so are not included in the unemployment statistics. However, some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labour market.\n\nIn the early stages of an [[boom and bust|economic boom]], unemployment often rises.<ref name=\"Keynes 2007\"/> That is because people join the labour market (give up studying, start a job hunt, etc.) as a result of the improving job market, but until they have actually found a position, they are counted as unemployed. Similarly, during a [[recession]], the increase in the unemployment rate is moderated by people leaving the labour force or being otherwise discounted from the labour force, such as with the self-employed.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2004, according to [[OECD]] ([http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/30/35024561.pdf Employment Outlook 2005] {{ISBN|92-64-01045-9}}), normalized unemployment for men aged 25 to 54 was 4.6% in the US and 7.4% in France. At the same time and for the same population, the employment rate (number of workers divided by population) was 86.3% in the US and 86.7% in France. That example shows that the unemployment rate was 60% higher in France than in the US, but more people in that demographic were working in France than in the US, which is counterintuitive if it is expected that the unemployment rate reflects the health of the labour market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Dean|url=http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&year=2007&base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&162#comment-1679545|title=Wall Street Journal Gets German Unemployment Wrong|work=The American Prospect|access-date=1 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033323/http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&year=2007&base_name=wall_street_journal_gets_germa&162#comment-1679545|archive-date=30 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Raymond Torres, OECD head of Employment Analysis, [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-917229@51-628862,0.html Avec 1,2 % de baisse fin avril, le taux de ch\u00f4mage continue sa d\u00e9crue]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Le Monde'', 30 mai 2007 : ''unemployment measure is less and less meaningful to measure labour market efficiency.''</ref>\n\nThose deficiencies make many [[labour economics|labour market]] economists prefer to look at a range of economic statistics such as labour market participation rate, the percentage of people between 15 and 64 who are currently employed or searching for employment, the total number of full-time jobs in an economy, the number of people seeking work as a raw number and not a percentage, and the total number of person-hours worked in a month compared to the total number of person-hours people would like to work.

Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black.]]\nThe labor force participation rate is the ratio between the [[labor force]] and the overall size of their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (national population of the same age range). In the West, during the later half of the 20th century, the labor force participation rate increased significantly because of an increase in the number of women entering the workplace.\n\nIn the United States, there have been four significant stages of women's participation in the labour force: increases in the 20th century and decreases in the 21st century. Male labor force participation decreased from 1953 to 2013. Since October 2013, men have been increasingly joining the labour force.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to the 1920s, very few women worked outside the home. They were young single women who typically withdrew from the labor force at marriage unless family needed two incomes. Such women worked primarily in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry or as [[domestic worker]]s. That profession empowered women and allowed them to earn a living wage. At times, they were a financial help to their families.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1950, female labor force participation increased primarily because of the increased demand for office workers, women's participation in the high school movement, and [[electrification]], which reduced the time that was spent on household chores. Between the 1950s to the early 1970s, most women were secondary earners working mainly as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians ([[pink-collar]] jobs).\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, there was a period of revolution of women in the labor force brought on by various factors, many of which arose from the [[second-wave feminism]] movement. Women more accurately planned for their future in the work force by investing in more applicable majors in college that prepared them to enter and compete in the labor market. In the United States, the female labor force participation rate rose from approximately 33% in 1948 to a peak of 60.3% in 2000. As of April 2015, the female labor force participation is at 56.6%, the male labor force participation rate is at 69.4%, and the total is 62.8%.<ref name=\"research.stlouisfed.org\">[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS11300002 Civilian Labor Force Participation Rate: Women] Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</ref>\n\nA common theory in modern economics claims that the rise of women participating in the US labor force in the 1950s to the 1990s was caused by the introduction of a new contraceptive technology, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], as well as the adjustment of [[age of majority]] laws. The use of birth control gave women the flexibility of opting to invest and to advance their career while they maintained a relationship. By having control over the timing of their fertility, they were not running a risk of thwarting their career choices. However, only 40% of the population actually used the birth control pill.\n\nThat implies that other factors may have contributed to women choosing to invest in advancing their careers. One factor may be that more and more men delayed the age of marriage, which allowef women to marry later in life without them worrying about the quality of older men. Other factors include the changing nature of work, with machines replacing physical labor, which eliminated many traditional male occupations, and the rise of the service sector in which many jobs are gender neutral.\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the trend was the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children.\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the labor force participation began to reverse its long period of increase. Reasons for the change include a rising share of older workers, an increase in school enrollment rates among young workers, and a decrease in female labor force participation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Zandweghe|first=Willem|title=Interpreting the Recent Decline in Labor Force Participation|journal=KC Fed Economic Review, First Quarter, 2012|pages=5\u201334|url=http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/econrev/pdf/12q1VanZandweghe.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe labor force participation rate can decrease when the rate of growth of the population outweighs that of the employed and the unemployed together.

However, since it is difficult or impossible to get unemployment insurance benefits without having worked in the past, those jobs and unemployment are more complementary than they are substitutes. (They are often held short-term, either by students or by those trying to gain experience; turnover in most low-paying jobs is high.)\n\nAnother cost for the unemployed is that the combination of unemployment, lack of financial resources, and social responsibilities may push unemployed workers to take jobs that do not fit their skills or allow them to use their talents. Unemployment can cause [[underemployment]], and fear of job loss can spur psychological anxiety. As well as anxiety, it can cause depression, lack of confidence, and huge amounts of stress, which is increased when the unemployed are faced with health issues, poverty, and lack of relational support.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Unemployment and underemployment: A narrative analysis about loss|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236855506|journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior|pages = 256\u2013265|volume = 82|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jvb.2013.02.005|first = David L.|last = Blustein|first2 = Saliha|last2 = Kozan|first3 = Alice|last3 = Connors-Kellgren|year = 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother personal cost of unemployment is its impact on relationships.

Employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive. The higher wages perpetuate unemployment, but the threat of unemployment reduces shirking.\n\nBefore current levels of world trade were developed, unemployment was shown to reduce inflation, following the [[Phillips curve]], or to decelerate inflation, following the NAIRU/[[natural rate of unemployment]] theory since it is relatively easy to seek a new job without losing a current job. When more jobs are available for fewer workers (lower unemployment), that may allow workers to find the jobs that better fit their tastes, talents and needs.\n\nAs in the Marxian theory of unemployment, [[special interests]] may also benefit. Some employers may expect that employees with no fear of losing their jobs will not work as hard or will demand increased wages and benefit. According to that theory, unemployment may promote general labour [[productivity]] and [[profit (economics)|profitability]] by increasing employers' rationale for their [[monopsony]]-like power (and profits).<ref name=\"Marx 1863 478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300\">{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Theorien \u00fcber den Mehrwert (Theory of Surplus Value)|year=1863|pages=478 or at MEW, 26.3, 300|url=http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me26/me26b471.htm}}</ref>\n\nOptimal unemployment has also been defended as an environmental tool to brake the constantly-accelerated growth of the GDP to maintain levels that are sustainable in the context of resource constraints and environmental impacts.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = O'Sullivan\n| first = Arthur\n| authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n| first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | authorlink2 = Steven M.

The demand for labour in an economy is derived from the demand for goods and services. As such, if the demand for goods and services in the economy increases, the demand for labour will increase, increasing employment and wages.\n\nThere are many ways to stimulate demand for goods and services. Increasing wages to the working class (those more likely to spend the increased funds on goods and services, rather than various types of savings or commodity purchases) is one theory thaf is proposed. Increased wages are believed to be more effective in boosting demand for goods and services than central banking strategies, which put the increased money supply mostly into the hands of wealthy persons and institutions. Monetarists suggest that increasing money supply in general increases short-term demand. As for the long-term demand, the increased demand is negated by inflation. A rise in fiscal expenditures is another strategy for boosting aggregate demand.\n\nProviding aid to the unemployed is a strategy that is used to prevent cutbacks in consumption of goods and services, which can lead to a vicious cycle of further job losses and further decreases in consumption and demand. Many countries aid the unemployed through social [[welfare]] programs. Such unemployment benefits include [[unemployment insurance]], [[unemployment compensation]], welfare, and subsidies to aid in retraining. The main goal of such programs is to alleviate short-term hardships and, more importantly, to allow workers more time to search for a job.\n\nA direct demand-side solution to unemployment is government-funded employment of the able-bodied poor. This was notably implemented in Britain from the 17th century until 1948 in the institution of the [[workhouse]], which provided jobs for the unemployed with harsh conditions and poor wages to dissuade their use. A modern alternative is a [[job guarantee]] in which the government guarantees work at a living wage.\n\nTemporary measures can include [[public works]] programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Government-funded employment is not widely advocated as a solution to unemployment except in times of crisis. That is attributed to the public sector jobs' existence depending directly on the tax receipts from private sector employment.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Top 10%.jpg|thumb|Supply-side economics proposes that lower taxes lead to employment growth. Historical state data from the United States shows a heterogeneous result.]]\n\nIn the US, the unemployment insurance allowance is based solely on previous income (not time worked, family size, etc.) and usually compensates for one third of previous income. To qualify, people must reside in their respective state for at least a year and work. The system was established by the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935. Although 90% of citizens are covered by unemployment insurance, less than 40% apply for and receive benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|title=Introduction to Unemployment Insurance|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1466#_ftn2|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=2008-12-15}}</ref> However, the number applying for and receiving benefits increases during recessions. For highly-seasonal industries, the system provides income to workers during the off-season, thus encouraging them to stay attached to the industry.\n[[File:State Employment growth and Tax Changes for the Bottom 90% v2.jpg|thumb|Tax decreases on high income earners (top 10%) are not correlated with employment growth, but tax decreases on lower-income earners (bottom 90%) are correlated with employment growth.<ref name=\"economix.blogs.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/tax-cuts-for-job-creators/ | work=The New York Times | title=Tax Cuts for Job Creators | date=19 October 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nAccording to classical economic theory, markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand; everyone who wants to sell at the market price can do so. Those who do not want to sell at that price do not; in the labour market, this is classical unemployment. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short-term growth in the economy, increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment.\n\n===Supply-side solutions===\nHowever, the labor market is not 100% efficient although it may be more efficient than the bureaucracy. Some argue that minimum wages and union activity keep wages from falling, which means that too many people want to sell their labour at the going price but cannot. That assumes [[perfect competition]] exists in the labour market, specifically that no single entity is large enough to affect wage levels and that employees are similar in ability.\n\nAdvocates of [[supply-side]] policies believe those policies can solve the problem by making the labour market more flexible. These include removing the minimum wage and reducing the power of unions. Supply-siders argue that their reforms increase long-term growth by reducing labour costs. The increased supply of goods and services requires more workers, increasing employment. It is argued that supply-side policies, which include cutting taxes on businesses and reducing regulation, create jobs, reduce unemployment, and decrease labor's share of national income. Other supply-side policies include education to make workers more attractive to employers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], 1931]]\nThere are relatively limited historical records on unemployment because it has not always been acknowledged or measured systematically. Industrialization involves [[economies of scale]], which often prevent individuals from having the capital to create their own jobs to be self-employed. An individual who cannot join an enterprise or create a job is unemployed. As individual farmers, ranchers, spinners, doctors and merchants are organized into large enterprises, those who cannot join or compete become unemployed.\n\nRecognition of unemployment occurred slowly as economies across the world industrialized and bureaucratized. Before then, traditional [[Self-sustainability|self-sufficient]] native societies have no concept of unemployment. The recognition of the concept of \"unemployment\" is best exemplified through the well documented historical records in England. For example, in 16th-century England no distinction was made between [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and the jobless; both were simply categorized as \"[[sturdy beggar]]s\", who were to be punished and moved on.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |title=Sturdy Beggars |publisher=Probertencyclopaedia.com |accessdate=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180220/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/res.pl?keyword=Sturdy+Beggars&offset=0 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe closing of the [[monastery|monasteries]] in the 1530s increased [[poverty]], as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped the poor. In addition, there was a significant rise in [[enclosures]] during the [[Tudor period]]. Also, the population was rising. Those unable to find work had a stark choice: starve or break the law. In 1535, a bill was drawn up calling for the creation of a system of [[public works]], which were to deal with the problem of unemployment and to be funded by a tax on income and capital.

When a small French force landed in Ireland that month, they achieved an initial victory but were soon defeated and forced to surrender.\n\nOther revolts across Ireland, including one in [[Ulster]], were also suppressed.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe rebellion was soon completely suppressed, in part because of the efforts of [[Charles Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], the British lord-lieutenant.  In the aftermath of the uprising, the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was [[Act of Union 1800|dissolved]] and the island fell under the complete jurisdiction of the [[British Parliament]] at [[Westminster]].<ref name=\"britannica1\"/>\n\n==Ireland in the Napoleonic Wars==\nBy 1803, the French Revolutionary Wars (or those of the First and Second Coalitions) had ended, with the 1799 rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to the French First Consulate and, a few years later, the imperial throne.

As the rebels approached, Kilwarden, fearing for his safety, fled his home with his daughter and a nephew, Reverend Wolfe.  The rebels surrounded the chief justice's carriage, killing his nephew and nearly killing Kilwarden.\n\nRobert Emmet had not authorised the attack (Kilwarden died later) and, seeing that rebels in the countryside had not risen, fired a flare, the signal to call off the uprising.  A few of his men refused to obey orders and attacked British soldiers, who retreated to their barracks.<ref name=\"triskelle1\"/> The revolt was over quickly.  Robert Emmet was arrested and later executed.\n\n===Quiet in Ireland===\nAfter Emmet's abortive rising, there were no instances of unrest in Ireland until after 1815, when the Napoleonic Wars ended with Bonaparte's final defeat, the [[Battle of Waterloo]].  Some Irishmen, including Robert Emmet's brother Thomas, had by then become hostile<ref name=\"triskelle1\"/> to the French, embittered toward them for failing to offer greater assistance in the revolts and for refusing to plan any more invasions after 1803.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)]]\n[[Category:Coalition Wars]]\n[[Category:French Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Ireland''' was involved '''in the [[Coalition Wars]]''', also known as the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] (1792\u20131802) and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] (1804\u20131815) Wars.

British excesses against the Catholic population were often ignored<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> by the authorities.\n\n===Uprising===\n{{Main article|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}\nDespite these British measures, and the lack of French assistance, the long-expected Irish revolt broke out in late May 1798.  Rebels seized mail coaches near Dublin, giving the signal that the revolt was to begin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> A blow was handed to the United Irishmen, spearheading the revolt, when Dubliners did not rise up against the British, but the uprising was rejuvenated by an unexpected turn of events in [[County Wexford]], where a detachment of [[North Cork Militia]] had been attacked.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nLoyal forces in Wexford managed to hold several key towns,<ref name=\"britannica1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294143/Irish-Rebellion# |title=Irish Rebellion (Irish history [1798&#93;) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> and the rebels in this area were defeated in the [[Battle of Vinegar Hill]] in June.  When a small French force landed in Ireland that month, they achieved an initial victory but were soon defeated and forced to surrender.\n\nOther revolts across Ireland, including one in [[Ulster]], were also suppressed.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe rebellion was soon completely suppressed, in part because of the efforts of [[Charles Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], the British lord-lieutenant.  In the aftermath of the uprising, the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was [[Act of Union 1800|dissolved]] and the island fell under the complete jurisdiction of the [[British Parliament]] at [[Westminster]].<ref name=\"britannica1\"/>\n\n==Ireland in the Napoleonic Wars==\nBy 1803, the French Revolutionary Wars (or those of the First and Second Coalitions) had ended, with the 1799 rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to the French First Consulate and, a few years later, the imperial throne.  A peace had been established between the warring nations of Europe, but it did not last long.  The [[War of the Third Coalition]] broke out in 1803, and, that same year, a minor revolt, known as the [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Emmet Rebellion]], occurred in Ireland.\n\n===Emmet's rising===\nAlong with fellow nationalists, [[Robert Emmet]] and his elder brother [[Thomas Addis Emmet|Thomas]], both members of the weakened United Irishmen, planned a second Irish rebellion for 1803, this time with French aid expected.  When, in July of that year, an arsenal of the rebel group exploded, Robert Emmet advanced the uprising, now ruling out any chance of French involvement.<ref name=\"triskelle1\">[http://www.triskelle.eu/history/rebellionof1803.php?index=060.070 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231152052/http://www.triskelle.eu/history/rebellionof1803.php?index=060.070 |date=31 December 2010 }}</ref> A crowd of about 200 Dubliners began to march on [[Dublin Castle]], the British seat of government, under the command of Robert (Thomas was in France, negotiating with Napoleon).\n\nThe major event of this revolt was the death of [[Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden|Viscount Kilwarden]], the British chief justice of Ireland.  As the rebels approached, Kilwarden, fearing for his safety, fled his home with his daughter and a nephew, Reverend Wolfe.  The rebels surrounded the chief justice's carriage, killing his nephew and nearly killing Kilwarden.\n\nRobert Emmet had not authorised the attack (Kilwarden died later) and, seeing that rebels in the countryside had not risen, fired a flare, the signal to call off the uprising.  A few of his men refused to obey orders and attacked British soldiers, who retreated to their barracks.<ref name=\"triskelle1\"/> The revolt was over quickly.  Robert Emmet was arrested and later executed.\n\n===Quiet in Ireland===\nAfter Emmet's abortive rising, there were no instances of unrest in Ireland until after 1815, when the Napoleonic Wars ended with Bonaparte's final defeat, the [[Battle of Waterloo]].  Some Irishmen, including Robert Emmet's brother Thomas, actually had become hostile<ref name=\"triskelle1\"/> to the French, embittered toward them for failing to offer greater assistance in the revolts and for refusing to plan any more invasions after 1803.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)]]\n[[Category:Coalition Wars]]\n[[Category:French Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars]]\n", "name_user": "Julia H.

Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland.

It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]].

It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', or \"sruggim\", referring to the knitted or crocheted ''[[kippot]]'' (skullcaps) worn by the men. (Many wear other types of headcoverings, such as black velvet ''kippot''.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis; beards are uncommon, although mustaches are often seen in the older generations.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

[[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', or \"sruggim\", referring to the knitted or crocheted ''[[kippot]]'' (skullcaps) worn by the men. (Many wear other types of headcoverings, such as black velvet ''kippot''.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis; beards are uncommon, although mustaches are often seen in the older generations.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

As a result of growing trade between the United Kingdom and the United States, Price Waterhouse opened an office in New York in 1890, and the American firm itself soon expanded rapidly. The original British firm opened an office in [[Liverpool]] in 1904 and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of PW was therefore a federation of collaborating firms that had grown organically rather than being the result of an international merger.<ref name=\"pwhistory\" />\n\nIn a further effort to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], PW and [[Arthur Andersen]] discussed a merger in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/companies/account.html |title=University of Washington: Accounting firms and organisations |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu}}</ref> but the negotiations failed mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen's strong commercial links with [[IBM]] and PW's audit of IBM as well as the radically different cultures of the two firms.  It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/business/fi-365_1_price-waterhouse|title=Accounting Giants Call Off Merger Plan : Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen Cite 'Differences'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1989|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1998 to present===\nIn 1998, Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase \"w\" and a [[camelcase]] \"C\").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625115425/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199709/ai_n8768518 Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand to merge] Weekly Corporate Growth Report 29 September 1997</ref>\n\nAfter the merger the firm had a large professional [[Consultant|consulting]] branch, as did other major accountancy firms, generating much of its fees. Management Consulting Services (MCS) was the fastest growing and often most profitable area of the practice, though it was cyclical. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems for multi-national companies. PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interests by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large proportion of the world's largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services including outsourcing of IT and back office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, [[Ernst & Young]] was the first of the [[Big Four auditors|Big Four]] to sell its consulting services, to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1017-237396.html Ernst & Young sells consulting unit to Cap Gemini] Cnet News, 29 February 2000</ref>\n\nThe fallout from the [[Enron]], [[Worldcom]] and other [[Enron scandal|financial auditing scandals]] led to the passage of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002), severely limiting interaction between management consulting and auditing (assurance) services. PwC Consulting began to conduct business under its own name rather than as the MCS division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC therefore planned to capitalize on MCS's rapid growth through its sale to [[Hewlett Packard]] (for a reported $17 billion) but negotiations broke down in 2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1021544.stm Hewlett-Packard drops PWC bid] BBC News, 13 November 2000</ref>\n\nIn 2000, PwC acquired Canada's largest SAP consulting partner Omnilogic Systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/637077--passion-for-business-takes-entrepreneur-from-software-to-cars-to-music|title=Passion for business takes entrepreneur from software to cars to music|work=therecord.com}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2002 Arthur Andersen, LLP affiliates in Hong Kong and China completed talks to join PricewaterhouseCoopers, China.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726114903/http://www.muzi.com/cc/english/10318%2C19931.shtml?q=1201761 Andersen Affiliates in China to Join Rival] Singapore News, 21 March 2002</ref>\n\nPwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm.

Hopkins}}\nIn 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Price Waterhouse must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding employment would have been the same if [[sex discrimination]] had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone [[Ann Hopkins]]'s promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]].

As a result of growing trade between the United Kingdom and the United States, Price Waterhouse opened an office in New York in 1890, and the American firm itself soon expanded rapidly. The original British firm opened an office in [[Liverpool]] in 1904 and then elsewhere in the United Kingdom and worldwide, each time establishing a separate partnership in each country: the worldwide practice of PW was therefore a federation of collaborating firms that had grown organically rather than being the result of an international merger.<ref name=\"pwhistory\" />\n\nIn a further effort to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], PW and [[Arthur Andersen]] discussed a merger in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/companies/account.html |title=University of Washington: Accounting firms and organisations |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu}}</ref> but the negotiations failed mainly because of conflicts of interest such as Andersen's strong commercial links with [[IBM]] and PW's audit of IBM as well as the radically different cultures of the two firms.  It was said by those involved with the failed merger that at the end of the discussion, the partners at the table realized they had different views of business, and the potential merger was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-26/business/fi-365_1_price-waterhouse|title=Accounting Giants Call Off Merger Plan : Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen Cite 'Differences'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1989|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1998 to present===\nIn 1998, Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form PricewaterhouseCoopers (written with a lowercase \"w\" and a [[camelcase]] \"C\").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625115425/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199709/ai_n8768518 Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand to merge] Weekly Corporate Growth Report 29 September 1997</ref>\n\nAfter the merger the firm had a large professional [[Consultant|consulting]] branch, as did other major accountancy firms, generating much of its fees. Management Consulting Services (MCS) was the fastest growing and often most profitable area of the practice, though it was cyclical. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems for multi-national companies. PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interests by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large proportion of the world's largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services including outsourcing of IT and back office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, [[Ernst & Young]] was the first of the [[Big Four auditors|Big Four]] to sell its consulting services, to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[http://www.news.com/2100-1017-237396.html Ernst & Young sells consulting unit to Cap Gemini] Cnet News, 29 February 2000</ref>\n\nThe fallout from the [[Enron]], [[Worldcom]] and other [[Enron scandal|financial auditing scandals]] led to the passage of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] (2002), severely limiting interaction between management consulting and auditing (assurance) services. PwC Consulting began to conduct business under its own name rather than as the MCS division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC therefore planned to capitalize on MCS's rapid growth through its sale to [[Hewlett Packard]] (for a reported $17 billion) but negotiations broke down in 2000.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1021544.stm Hewlett-Packard drops PWC bid] BBC News, 13 November 2000</ref>\n\nIn 2000, PwC acquired Canada's largest SAP consulting partner Omnilogic Systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/business/article/637077--passion-for-business-takes-entrepreneur-from-software-to-cars-to-music|title=Passion for business takes entrepreneur from software to cars to music|work=therecord.com}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2002 Arthur Andersen, LLP affiliates in Hong Kong and China completed talks to join PricewaterhouseCoopers, China.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726114903/http://www.muzi.com/cc/english/10318%2C19931.shtml?q=1201761 Andersen Affiliates in China to Join Rival] Singapore News, 21 March 2002</ref>\n\nPwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm.

Hopkins}}\nIn 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that Price Waterhouse must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision regarding employment would have been the same if [[sex discrimination]] had not occurred. The accounting firm failed to prove that the same decision to postpone [[Ann Hopkins]]'s promotion to partnership would have still been made in the absence of sex discrimination, and therefore, the employment decision constituted sex discrimination under [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The significance of the Supreme Court's ruling was twofold. First, it established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination. Second, it established the [[Mixed motive discrimination|mixed-motive framework]] as an evidentiary framework for proving discrimination under a disparate treatment theory even when lawful reasons for the adverse employment action are also present.<ref>Goldstein, Leslie. \"Gender Stereotyping and the Workplace: Price Waterhouse v.

General Re transferred $500 million in anticipated claims and premiums to AIG.

The insurer was expected to cover the difference in value between the [[credit default swap]] contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however the head of the unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by ''Business Insider'', witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/joe-cassano-on-goldman-aig-dispute-2016-3?r=US&IR=T|title=We just got a new insight into a crucial crisis-era dispute between Goldman Sachs and AIG|website=Business Insider|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===ChuoAoyama Suspension===\n{{Nihongo|ChuoAoyama Audit Corporation|\u4e2d\u592e\u9752\u5c71\u76e3\u67fb\u6cd5\u4eba|Ch\u016b\u014d-Aoyama Kansa H\u014djin}} was the Japanese affiliate of assurance service of PwC from April 2000 to 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/10-088.pdf|title=Audit Quality and Auditor Reputation: Evidence from Japan}}</ref> In May 2006, the Financial Services Agency of Japan suspended ChuoAoyama from provision of some statutory auditing services for two months<ref>{{cite document|title=In May 2006, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) suspended ChuoAoyama for two months|ssrn=1557231}}</ref> following the collapse of cosmetics company Kanebo, of which three of the partners were found assisting with accounting fraud for boosting earnings by the company of about $1.9 billion over the course of five years.
