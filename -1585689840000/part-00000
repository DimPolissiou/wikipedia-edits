Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===1===\n\n==March==\n===31===\n*[[Pierre B\u00e9nichou]], 82, Algerian-born French journalist.<ref>[https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2020/03/31/mort-de-pierre-benichou-ancien-dirigeant-de-l-obs-et-chroniqueur-des-grosses-tetes_6035051_3382.html Mort de Pierre B\u00e9nichou, ancien dirigeant de \u00ab L\u2019Obs \u00bb et chroniqueur des \u00ab Grosses T\u00eates \u00bb] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Pape Diouf]], 68, Senegalese journalist, COVID-19.<ref>[http://www.foot-national.com/foot-de-nombreux-joueurs-reagissent-a-la-mort-de-pape-diouf-131879.html?fbclid=IwAR3SR7_ocofNDmjie3qLIarUlJoK2bIzaakxGJo7vvP5q2ut69TQQR_pSCs De nombreux joueurs r\u00e9agissent \u00e0 la mort de Pape Diouf] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Rafael G\u00f3mez Nieto|es}}, 99, Spanish resistance fighter ([[La Nueve]]), [[COVID-19]].<ref>[https://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20200331/48215141168/rafael-gomez-nieto-la-nueve-paris-nazis-hitler-republicanos.html Fallece el \u00faltimo superviviente de la compa\u00f1\u00eda que liber\u00f3 Par\u00eds de los nazis] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Bob Hasan]], 89, Indonesian businessman and politician, lung cancer.<ref>[https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/31/track-and-field-figure-former-minister-mohamad-bob-hasan-dies-of-cancer.html Track and field figure, former minister Mohamad \u2018Bob\u2019 Hasan dies of cancer]</ref>\n*[[Andrew Jack (dialect coach)|Andrew Jack]], 76, British dialect coach (''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'') and actor (''[[Star Wars]]''), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/andrew-jack-dead-dialect-coach-star-wars-actor-was-76-1287685 Andrew Jack, Dialect Coach and 'Star Wars' Actor, Dies at 76 From Coronavirus Complications]</ref>\n*[[Abdul Halim Khaddam]], 87, Syrian politician, [[Vice President of Syria|Vice President]] (1984\u20132005), Acting [[President of Syria|President]] (2000) and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (Syria)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] (1970\u20131984).<ref>[https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/former-syrian-vice-president-abdel-halim-khaddam-passes-away-in-france/ Former Syrian Vice President Abdel-Halim Khaddam passes away in France]</ref>\n*[[Eva Kr\u00ed\u017eikov\u00e1]], 85, Slovak actress (''[[In the Coat of Lioness' Arms]]'').<ref>[https://www.ta3.com/clanok/1179827/zomrela-slovenska-herecka-eva-krizikova-mala-85-rokov.html Zomrela slovensk\u00e1 here\u010dka Eva Kr\u00ed\u017eikov\u00e1, mala 85 rokov] {{in lang|sk}}</ref>\n*[[Hedgemon Lewis]], 74, American boxer.<ref>[https://fightnews.com/hedgemon-lewis-passes-away/72262 Hedgemon Lewis passes away]</ref>\n*[[Reimar L\u00fcst]], 97, German astrophysicist, director of the [[Max Planck Society]] (1972\u20131984), director-general of the [[European Space Agency]] (1984\u20131990).<ref>[https://www.mpg.de/14637221/souveraener-steuermann-der-wissenschaft Souver\u00e4ner Steuermann der Wissenschaft] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n*[[Vincent Marzello]], 68, American actor (''[[The Witches (1990 film)|The Witches]]'', ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', ''[[Bob the Builder]]'').<ref>[https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/31/witches-star-vincent-marzello-dies-aged-68-12484672/ The Witches star Vincent Marzello dies aged 68]</ref>\n*[[Paul Natali]], 86, French politician.<ref>[https://www.corsenetinfos.corsica/Entrepreunariat-sport-politique-Paul-Natali-n-est-plus_a48796.html Entrepreunariat, sport, politique : Paul Natali n'est plus] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*<!--Nd-->[[Raphael S.

It was the last aircraft to be developed by Avro prior to its dissolution.\n\nThe HS 748 was developed during the late 1950s as a move to re-orientate the company towards the civil and export markets. Powered by the popular [[Rolls-Royce Dart]] [[turboprop]] engine, it was specifically designed as a modern [[feederliner]] to act as a replacement for the aging [[Douglas DC-3]]s then in widespread service. Originally intended to seat a smaller number of passengers, market research indicated that a seating capacity of around 40 passengers would be optimal for the type. As a means to differentiate the new airliner from competitors, it was designed to possess a high level of performance, including its [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) capabilities and overall ruggedness. First flying on 24 June 1960, the series 1 HS 748 entered revenue service during the following year.\n\nOnce in service, the HS 748 found itself a niche within the short-haul market. Several different models would be developed of the [[regional airliner]], typical improvements being the adoption of increasingly powerful Dart engines and a higher gross weight. Perhaps the most distinct variant was the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|HS 780 Andover]], a dedicated military transport model developed for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) that featured a large rear loading ramp and a squatting main landing gear to assist in loading bulky freight items. By 1988, the year in which production of the type was terminated, 380 aircraft had been produced between [[Hawker Siddeley]] (the owning company of Avro) and Indian aviation company [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL). During the 1990s, a larger, stretched development of the HS 748, the [[BAe ATP]], was developed and had attempted to compete with market leaders such as the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 8]] and [[ATR 42]], but saw only limited sales prior to production being terminated.\n\n== Development ==\n===Background===\nFollowing the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], in which then-[[Minister of Defence (United Kingdom)|Minister of Defense]] [[Duncan Sandys]] announced that the termination of almost all manned military aircraft development, aircraft manufacturer Avro decided that it should place a greater emphasis upon the civilian market. Ten years prior, it had launched a civilian airliner, the [[Avro Tudor]] series, but this had encountered few sales; thus, during 1958, it was decided to commence work upon a clean-sheet design, which would eventually become the HS 748. On 9 January 1959, the existence of the project, then referred to as the ''Avro 748'', was announced to the public.<ref name = \"flight 783\"/>\n\nBy this point, the four-engined [[Vickers Viscount]] had already secured the larger end of the short-haul market, therefore Avro decided that it would design a smaller [[regional airliner]], powered by a pair of [[Rolls-Royce Dart]] [[turboprop]] engines. It was envisioned that this aircraft would be a suitable replacement for the many [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3 Dakotas]] that were by then reaching the end of their economic lifespan. According to aviation periodical [[Flight International]], a major goal for the design team was to produce an aircraft that would be capable of operating from any airfield that the DC-3 could be.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/>\n\nEarly intentions for the airliner was of a 20\u201330 seat aircraft, adopting a somewhat similar configuration to the future rival [[Fokker F27 Friendship]]; however, following discussions with several potential customers, the company opted for a low-wing 40-seat configuration. It was this latter arrangement that was chosen for the 748 project. Another important focus for the prospective airliner was compliance with both British and [[United States|American]] standards of [[airworthiness]]; accordingly, it would be one of the first medium-sized aircraft to incorporate [[fail-safe]] design principles for its structure in place of the then-common [[Safe-life design|safe-life]] principles being practiced.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> The airframe effectively lacked any imposed lifespan; during development, it was successfully tested using a [[water tank]] for up to the equivalent of 100,000 flight hours.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/>\n\nAvro was not the only company to see the potential for a DC-3 replacement and, by this point, work on the 748's direct competitor, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-built F27 Friendship, was well advanced. To differentiate itself from the competition, Avro decided to focus its efforts upon achieving a more rugged design that offered superior [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) performance, which enabled the prospective airliner to be operated from smaller and more austere airports, including those without modern [[runway]]s.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> This STOL capability was accomplished via several features, including the adoption of a long, [[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|high lift wing]], which was fitted with a unique [[Slotted flap|single slot flap]] with a hinged [[Servo tab|flap tab]] at the [[trailing edge]]. This wing was mounted low on the fuselage with [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] from the root, allowing for good overall ground clearance and the easy mounting of strong [[landing gear]]. Operationally, pilots were provided with a choice of three takeoff flap settings to select the level of STOL performance required.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/>\n\nAnother supportive feature of the 748 was a design decision to adopt straightforward systems and use proven components where realistically possible.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> For operator convenience, the engines were provided with an internal ignition system; various other systems and structures throughout the airliner were designed to be easy to inspect and to perform repairs upon, even when at unprepared airstrips with limited equipment available. Likely as a consequence of these favourable qualities, the 748 quickly attracted the attention of a variety of airlines, particularly those that typically operated in remote areas, which has been attributed to its ability to operate from short rough fields without any ground service equipment while being capable of hauling [[payload]]s in excess of 10,000&nbsp;lb.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Into flight===\n[[File:BKS Avro 748 at Manchester 1964.jpg|thumb|right|[[BKS Air Transport]] Avro 748 Series 1 at Manchester in 1964]]\n[[File:HS748 LV-HHE Aerolineas Bs As 26.04.72 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aerolineas Argentinas]] Avro 748 Series 1 at [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]], Buenos Aires, in 1972]]\nOn 24 June 1960, the first Avro 748 made its [[maiden flight]] from the company's [[Woodford Aerodrome|Woodford, Cheshire]] aircraft factory.<ref name = \"bae heri\">[https://www.baesystems.com/en/heritage/avro-748---avro-748mf \"Avro 748 & Avro 748MF Andover.\"] ''BAE Systems'', Retrieved: 26 June 2019.</ref> Flight testing of the two prototypes quickly validated the type's short-field performance. Eighteen ''Avro 748 Series 1'' aircraft were produced; during April 1962, the first production aircraft were delivered to launch customer [[Skyways Coach-Air Limited]]. However, the majority of the series 1 were export sales to operator [[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} During the early 1960s, Avro's individual identity within the [[Hawker Siddeley]] Group was expunged, after which the airliner was marketed by the parent company as the ''HS 748''.\n\nAfter the initial batch of series 1 aircraft was completed, production transitioned to the improved series 2. The series 2 was largely similar to its predecessor, principally benefiting from the adoption of more powerful ''Dart RDa 7 Mk 531'' engines and an increased gross weight. According to aviation periodical [[Flight International]], during 1960, the basic price for a new Avro 748 Series 1 was \u00a3176,000, while that of the corresponding Avro 748 Series 2 was reportedly \u00a3196,000.<ref name = \"flight 783\">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%202661.html \"Avro 748.\"] ''Flight International'', 18 November 1960. p. 783.</ref>\n\nDuring 1967, the series 2A was introduced, which was the same basic aircraft powered by ''Mk. 532'' engines along with a further increase in gross weight. From 1971 onwards, several new options were made available to customers, including a large freight door in the rear cabin and a strengthened cabin floor. During 1979, the Series 2B was introduced, which saw a 4-foot increase in [[wingspan]], the adoption of ''Mk 536-2'' engines, along with a modernised passenger cabin, and various improvements to the fuel, [[Water injection (engine)|water methanol injection system]], and engine [[Fire suppression system|fire protection systems]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring 1976, Eric Johnson, sales engineering manager of Hawker Siddeley Manchester, stated that the company was studying options for equipping a model of the HS 748 with [[turbofan]] engines, and that a preferred powerplant at that point was the [[Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H]], as used on the [[VFW-Fokker 614]] jetliner.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> Other changes would likely have been incorporated, including the addition of lift dumpers and adaptive brakes for better landing performance, while electrical, [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] and [[air conditioning]] systems would be redesigned; externally, a dihedral would have to be introduced to keep the tailplane clear of the jet exhaust. It was envisioned that the reengined aircraft could offers larger seating arrangements of up to 64 seats.<ref name = \"flight 1342\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1976/1976%20-%200852.PDF \"HS.748 looks to the 1980s.\"] ''Flight International'', 22 May 1976. p. 1342.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the British production line, manufacture of the 748 was also performed overseas. Early on, India had placed orders for the type.<ref name = \"flight 783\"/> Both the 748 Series 1 and Series 2 were [[Licensed production|licence-produced]] in Indian manufacturer [[Hindustan Aeronautics]] (HAL), aircraft produced by the company were designated ''HAL-748''. On 1 November 1961, the first Indian-assembled HAL-748 made its first flight.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> By the end of production, HAL had completed 89 Indian-built aircraft, 72 of which were for the [[Indian Air Force]] and 17 were delivered to national [[flag carrier]] [[Indian Airlines]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nWhile the HS 748 was originally intended to be marketed principally towards the civilian market, numerous examples were sold to military customers around the world. Hawker Siddeley used the design as the basis for the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|HS 780 Andover]], a military transport aircraft developed and produced for the [[Royal Air Force]]. In terms of its design, the HS 780 was broadly similar to the 748, differing primarily by its redesigned rear [[fuselage]] and [[empennage]], which incorporated a large rear loading ramp and a squatting main landing gear to better facilitate the loading of bulky freight items.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/>\n\nDuring 1988, production of the HS 748 was terminated, while the last British-assembled aircraft made its first flight on 1 December of that year.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> According to [[BAE Systems]], a successor company to Hawker Siddeley, during the type's production life, a total of 381 aircraft had been produced, when including both the Andover and HAL-built examples.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\nWithin its first decade of its availability, sales of the HS 748 had reportedly been relatively brisk; by 1976, the sale of 312 aircraft had been recorded, of which 259 had been to export customers.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> Within ten years of its launch, India had emerged as the largest single market for the airliner, [[Indian Airlines]] being the largest HS 748 operator with a fleet of 26 aircraft.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/> It had been popular with numerous commercial operators, across the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]] alone, 63 HS 748s were in operation with 11 separate operators.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/>\n\nThe HS 748 had been able to achieve some triumphs over competing rivals, including the F27 Friendship. [[Philippine Airlines]] had been the F27's largest operator prior to its decision to replace both it and its remaining DC-3s with the HS 748, which represented a significant sales coup for the latter.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> Other major civil operators included [[Aerolineas Argentinas]], [[VARIG]], [[Thai Airways]], [[LAN-Chile]], and [[Bouraq Airlines]].<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> Several of these operators would utilise its STOL capabilities in their services; according to Flight International, over one-third of all scheduled operations were reportedly involved operations from rough airstrips with minimalist facilities.<ref name = \"flight 1213\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%201178.html \"The 748 is Ten.\"] ''Flight International'', 2 July 1970. pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nAnother key market for the HS 748 was the [[VIP|executive]] role; the type was repeatedly procured to serve as the designated aircraft for various [[head of state|heads of state]], including of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], India, [[Venezuela]], [[Zambia]], [[Thailand]] and the United Kingdom.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/> The HS 748 was one of the last planes to be flown by noted [[aviator]] and [[business magnate]] [[Howard Hughes]]. During 1972, Hughes performed several flights of the type, each time accompanied by Hawker Siddeley test pilot Tony Blackman, flying from the company's airport in [[Hatfield Aerodrome|Hatfield]].<ref>Blackman 2005, p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe Australian military purchased several aircraft; specifically, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) procured a fleet of ten HS 748s, the first of which arriving in 1968, for navigation training and transporting [[VIP]]s.<ref name = \"aus navy\"/> The [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) operated a pair of HS 748s starting in 1973 as a navigational trainer. Following [[Cyclone Tracy]], relief aid was delivered across [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] using the type; after being fitted with various [[electronic countermeasure]]s (ECM) during the late 1970s, HS 748s were also used for [[electronic warfare]] training.<ref name = \"aus navy\">[http://www.navy.gov.au/aircraft/hawker-siddeley-hs748 \"Hawker Siddeley HS748.\"] ''[[Royal Australian Navy]]'', Retrieved: 26 June 2019.</ref>\n\nIn a typical passenger configuration, the HS 748 can accommodate around 40\u201348 [[economy class]] seats in a four abreast layout; however, the majority of later-serving passenger HS 748s were typically operated as quick change ''combis''. These aircraft are fitted with a movable [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] that divides the main cabin, housing between 4 and 40 seats in the rear section while cargo is placed the forward section.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/> The 748 has also been widely used as a pure freighter, having a typical max payload of about 12,000&nbsp;lbs. Several carriers have used the 748 as a bulk fuel hauler, in which capacity it is normally with either seven or eight fixed tanks in the cabin, possessing a total capacity of about 7500 litres (2000 US Gallons).{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe [[ICAO]] designator as used in [[flight plan]]s is A748.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Variants ==\n* '''748 Series 1''' \u2013 The original Avro 748 twin-engined short / medium-range airliner, powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart RDa 7 Mk 514 turboprop engines. 24 built.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/>\n* '''{{visible anchor|748 Series 2}}''' \u2013 The Series 2 entered production in 1961 with a higher take-off weight and Mk 531 engines. 111 built.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|748 Series 2A}}''' \u2013 Introduced in 1967, with a further increase in take-off weight and Mk 532 or 534 engines. 157 built, making the 748 one of the more successful British airliners and the 2A the most popular variant.\n* '''748 Series 2B''' \u2013 The main production model after Hawker-Siddeley was absorbed by British Aerospace, the 2B featured a 4-foot increase in wingspan, increased gross weight, Mk 536 engines, a modernized cabin, and systems improvements. 28 built.\n* '''Super 748''' \u2013 Basically the same as the 2B but fitted with engine hush kits. 8 Built.\n* '''[[Hawker Siddeley HS780 Andover]]''' \u2013 Modified version of the 748 design for the Royal Air Force.

The 51 people on board survived. This was the first accident that resulted in a write-off on an Avro 748 / HS748.\n* On 15 August 1967, two accidents involving HS-748-222 Series 2 aircraft of Channel Airways Limited, occurred roughly 90 minutes apart at Portsmouth Airport. In the first incident, G-ATEK, operating a scheduled service from Southend to Paris, via Portsmouth, landed in rainy conditions and was unable to stop in the available distance on the grass runway. The aircraft slid sideways, left the runway and stopped on an embankment. Some 90 minutes later, aircraft G-ATEH, operating a scheduled service from Jersey, via Guernsey to Portsmouth, landed and slid on the runway, crashed through a perimeter fence and came to rest on the main Eastern Road. There were no injuries in either accident, but both aircraft sustained serious damage.

It was the last aircraft to be developed by Avro prior to its dissolution.\n\nThe HS 748 was developed during the late 1950s as a move to re-orientate the company towards the civil and export markets. Powered by the popular [[Rolls-Royce Dart]] [[turboprop]] engine, it was specifically designed as a modern [[feederliner]] to act as a replacement for the aging [[Douglas DC-3]]s then in widespread service. Originally intended to seat a smaller number of passengers, market research indicated that a seating capacity of around 40 passengers would be optimal for the type. As a means to differentiate the new airliner from competitors, it was designed to possess a high level of performance, including its [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) capabilities and overall ruggedness. First flying on 24 June 1960, the series 1 HS 748 entered revenue service during the following year.\n\nOnce in service, the HS 748 found itself a niche within the short-haul market. Several different models would be developed of the [[regional airliner]], typical improvements being the adoption of increasingly powerful Dart engines and a higher gross weight. Perhaps the most distinct variant was the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|HS 780 Andover]], a dedicated military transport model developed for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) that featured a large rear loading ramp and a squatting main landing gear to assist in loading bulky freight items. By 1988, the year in which production of the type was terminated, 380 aircraft had been produced between [[Hawker Siddeley]] (the owning company of Avro) and Indian aviation company [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL). During the 1990s, a larger, stretched development of the HS 748, the [[BAe ATP]], was developed and had attempted to compete with market leaders such as the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 8]] and [[ATR 42]], but saw only limited sales prior to production being terminated.\n\n== Development ==\n===Background===\nFollowing the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], in which then-[[Minister of Defence (United Kingdom)|Minister of Defense]] [[Duncan Sandys]] announced that the termination of almost all manned military aircraft development, aircraft manufacturer Avro decided that it should place a greater emphasis upon the civilian market. Ten years prior, it had launched a civilian airliner, the [[Avro Tudor]] series, but this had encountered few sales; thus, during 1958, it was decided to commence work upon a clean-sheet design, which would eventually become the HS 748. On 9 January 1959, the existence of the project, then referred to as the ''Avro 748'', was announced to the public.<ref name = \"flight 783\"/>\n\nBy this point, the four-engined [[Vickers Viscount]] had already secured the larger end of the short-haul market, therefore Avro decided that it would design a smaller [[regional airliner]], powered by a pair of [[Rolls-Royce Dart]] [[turboprop]] engines. It was envisioned that this aircraft would be a suitable replacement for the many [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3 Dakotas]] that were by then reaching the end of their economic lifespan. According to aviation periodical [[Flight International]], a major goal for the design team was to produce an aircraft that would be capable of operating from any airfield that the DC-3 could be.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/>\n\nEarly intentions for the airliner was of a 20\u201330 seat aircraft, adopting a somewhat similar configuration to the future rival [[Fokker F27 Friendship]]; however, following discussions with several potential customers, the company opted for a low-wing 40-seat configuration. It was this latter arrangement that was chosen for the 748 project. Another important focus for the prospective airliner was compliance with both British and [[United States|American]] standards of [[airworthiness]]; accordingly, it would be one of the first medium-sized aircraft to incorporate [[fail-safe]] design principles for its structure in place of the then-common [[Safe-life design|safe-life]] principles being practiced.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> The airframe effectively lacked any imposed lifespan; during development, it was successfully tested using a [[water tank]] for up to the equivalent of 100,000 flight hours.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/>\n\nAvro was not the only company to see the potential for a DC-3 replacement and, by this point, work on the 748's direct competitor, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-built F27 Friendship, was well advanced. To differentiate itself from the competition, Avro decided to focus its efforts upon achieving a more rugged design that offered superior [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] (STOL) performance, which enabled the prospective airliner to be operated from smaller and more austere airports, including those without modern [[runway]]s.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> This STOL capability was accomplished via several features, including the adoption of a long, [[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|high lift wing]], which was fitted with a unique [[Slotted flap|single slot flap]] with a hinged [[Servo tab|flap tab]] at the [[trailing edge]]. This wing was mounted low on the fuselage with [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] from the root, allowing for good overall ground clearance and the easy mounting of strong [[landing gear]]. Operationally, pilots were provided with a choice of three takeoff flap settings to select the level of STOL performance required.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/>\n\nAnother supportive feature of the 748 was a design decision to adopt straightforward systems and use proven components where realistically possible.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> For operator convenience, the engines were provided with an internal ignition system; various other systems and structures throughout the airliner were designed to be easy to inspect and to perform repairs upon, even when at unprepared airstrips with limited equipment available. Likely as a consequence of these favourable qualities, the 748 quickly attracted the attention of a variety of airlines, particularly those that typically operated in remote areas, which has been attributed to its ability to operate from short rough fields without any ground service equipment while being capable of hauling [[payload]]s in excess of 10,000&nbsp;lb.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Into flight===\n[[File:BKS Avro 748 at Manchester 1964.jpg|thumb|right|[[BKS Air Transport]] Avro 748 Series 1 at Manchester in 1964]]\n[[File:HS748 LV-HHE Aerolineas Bs As 26.04.72 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aerolineas Argentinas]] Avro 748 Series 1 at [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]], Buenos Aires, in 1972]]\nOn 24 June 1960, the first Avro 748 made its [[maiden flight]] from the company's [[Woodford Aerodrome|Woodford, Cheshire]] aircraft factory.<ref name = \"bae heri\">[https://www.baesystems.com/en/heritage/avro-748---avro-748mf \"Avro 748 & Avro 748MF Andover.\"] ''BAE Systems'', Retrieved: 26 June 2019.</ref> Flight testing of the two prototypes quickly validated the type's short-field performance. Eighteen ''Avro 748 Series 1'' aircraft were produced; during April 1962, the first production aircraft were delivered to launch customer [[Skyways Coach-Air Limited]]. However, the majority of the series 1 were export sales to operator [[Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} During the early 1960s, Avro's individual identity within the [[Hawker Siddeley]] Group was expunged, after which the airliner was marketed by the parent company as the ''HS 748''.\n\nAfter the initial batch of series 1 aircraft was completed, production transitioned to the improved series 2. The series 2 was largely similar to its predecessor, principally benefiting from the adoption of more powerful ''Dart RDa 7 Mk 531'' engines and an increased gross weight. According to aviation periodical [[Flight International]], during 1960, the basic price for a new Avro 748 Series 1 was \u00a3176,000, while that of the corresponding Avro 748 Series 2 was reportedly \u00a3196,000.<ref name = \"flight 783\">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%202661.html \"Avro 748.\"] ''Flight International'', 18 November 1960. p. 783.</ref>\n\nDuring 1967, the series 2A was introduced, which was the same basic aircraft powered by ''Mk. 532'' engines along with a further increase in gross weight. From 1971 onwards, several new options were made available to customers, including a large freight door in the rear cabin and a strengthened cabin floor. During 1979, the Series 2B was introduced, which saw a 4-foot increase in [[wingspan]], the adoption of ''Mk 536-2'' engines, along with a modernised passenger cabin, and various improvements to the fuel, [[Water injection (engine)|water methanol injection system]], and engine [[Fire suppression system|fire protection systems]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring 1976, Eric Johnson, sales engineering manager of Hawker Siddeley Manchester, stated that the company was studying options for equipping a model of the HS 748 with [[turbofan]] engines, and that a preferred powerplant at that point was the [[Rolls-Royce/SNECMA M45H]], as used on the [[VFW-Fokker 614]] jetliner.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> Other changes would likely have been incorporated, including the addition of lift dumpers and adaptive brakes for better landing performance, while electrical, [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] and [[air conditioning]] systems would be redesigned; externally, a dihedral would have to be introduced to keep the tailplane clear of the jet exhaust. It was envisioned that the reengined aircraft could offers larger seating arrangements of up to 64 seats.<ref name = \"flight 1342\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1976/1976%20-%200852.PDF \"HS.748 looks to the 1980s.\"] ''Flight International'', 22 May 1976. p. 1342.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the British production line, manufacture of the 748 was also performed overseas. Early on, India had placed orders for the type.<ref name = \"flight 783\"/> Both the 748 Series 1 and Series 2 were [[Licensed production|licence-produced]] in Indian manufacturer [[Hindustan Aeronautics]] (HAL), aircraft produced by the company were designated ''HAL-748''. On 1 November 1961, the first Indian-assembled HAL-748 made its first flight.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> By the end of production, HAL had completed 89 Indian-built aircraft, 72 of which were for the [[Indian Air Force]] and 17 were delivered to national [[flag carrier]] [[Indian Airlines]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nWhile the HS 748 was originally intended to be marketed principally towards the civilian market, numerous examples were sold to military customers around the world. Hawker Siddeley used the design as the basis for the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover|HS 780 Andover]], a military transport aircraft developed and produced for the [[Royal Air Force]]. In terms of its design, the HS 780 was broadly similar to the 748, differing primarily by its redesigned rear [[fuselage]] and [[empennage]], which incorporated a large rear loading ramp and a squatting main landing gear to better facilitate the loading of bulky freight items.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/>\n\nDuring 1988, production of the HS 748 was terminated, while the last British-assembled aircraft made its first flight on 1 December of that year.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> According to [[BAE Systems]], a successor company to Hawker Siddeley, during the type's production life, a total of 381 aircraft had been produced, when including both the Andover and HAL-built examples.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\nWithin its first decade of its availability, sales of the HS 748 had reportedly been relatively brisk; by 1976, the sale of 312 aircraft had been recorded, of which 259 had been to export customers.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> Within ten years of its launch, India had emerged as the largest single market for the airliner, [[Indian Airlines]] being the largest HS 748 operator with a fleet of 26 aircraft.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/> It had been popular with numerous commercial operators, across the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]] alone, 63 HS 748s were in operation with 11 separate operators.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/>\n\nThe HS 748 had been able to achieve some triumphs over competing rivals, including the F27 Friendship. [[Philippine Airlines]] had been the F27's largest operator prior to its decision to replace both it and its remaining DC-3s with the HS 748, which represented a significant sales coup for the latter.<ref name = \"flight 1342\"/> Other major civil operators included [[Aerolineas Argentinas]], [[VARIG]], [[Thai Airways]], [[LAN-Chile]], and [[Bouraq Airlines]].<ref name = \"bae heri\"/> Several of these operators would utilise its STOL capabilities in their services; according to Flight International, over one-third of all scheduled operations were reportedly involved operations from rough airstrips with minimalist facilities.<ref name = \"flight 1213\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%201178.html \"The 748 is Ten.\"] ''Flight International'', 2 July 1970. pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nAnother key market for the HS 748 was the [[VIP|executive]] role; the type was repeatedly procured to serve as the designated aircraft for various [[head of state|heads of state]], including of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], India, [[Venezuela]], [[Zambia]], [[Thailand]] and the United Kingdom.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/> The HS 748 was one of the last planes to be flown by noted [[aviator]] and [[business magnate]] [[Howard Hughes]]. During 1972, Hughes performed several flights of the type, each time accompanied by Hawker Siddeley test pilot Tony Blackman, flying from the company's airport in [[Hatfield Aerodrome|Hatfield]].<ref>Blackman 2005, p. 265.</ref>\n\nThe Australian military purchased several aircraft; specifically, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) procured a fleet of ten HS 748s, the first of which arriving in 1968, for navigation training and transporting [[VIP]]s.<ref name = \"aus navy\"/> The [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) operated a pair of HS 748s starting in 1973 as a navigational trainer. Following [[Cyclone Tracy]], relief aid was delivered across [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] using the type; after being fitted with various [[electronic countermeasure]]s (ECM) during the late 1970s, HS 748s were also used for [[electronic warfare]] training.<ref name = \"aus navy\">[http://www.navy.gov.au/aircraft/hawker-siddeley-hs748 \"Hawker Siddeley HS748.\"] ''[[Royal Australian Navy]]'', Retrieved: 26 June 2019.</ref>\n\nIn a typical passenger configuration, the HS 748 can accommodate around 40\u201348 [[economy class]] seats in a four abreast layout; however, the majority of later-serving passenger HS 748s were typically operated as quick change ''combis''. These aircraft are fitted with a movable [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] that divides the main cabin, housing between 4 and 40 seats in the rear section while cargo is placed the forward section.<ref name = \"flight 1213\"/> The 748 has also been widely used as a pure freighter, having a typical max payload of about 12,000&nbsp;lbs. Several carriers have used the 748 as a bulk fuel hauler, in which capacity it is normally with either seven or eight fixed tanks in the cabin, possessing a total capacity of about 7500 litres (2000 US Gallons).{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe [[ICAO]] designator as used in [[flight plan]]s is A748.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Variants ==\n* '''748 Series 1''' \u2013 The original Avro 748 twin-engined short / medium-range airliner, powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart RDa 7 Mk 514 turboprop engines. 24 built.<ref name = \"bae heri\"/>\n* '''{{visible anchor|748 Series 2}}''' \u2013 The Series 2 entered production in 1961 with a higher take-off weight and Mk 531 engines. 111 built.\n* '''{{Visible anchor|748 Series 2A}}''' \u2013 Introduced in 1967, with a further increase in take-off weight and Mk 532 or 534 engines. 157 built, making the 748 one of the more successful British airliners and the 2A the most popular variant.\n* '''748 Series 2B''' \u2013 The main production model after Hawker-Siddeley was absorbed by British Aerospace, the 2B featured a 4-foot increase in wingspan, increased gross weight, Mk 536 engines, a modernized cabin, and systems improvements. 28 built.\n* '''Super 748''' \u2013 Basically the same as the 2B but fitted with engine hush kits. 8 Built.\n* '''[[Hawker Siddeley HS780 Andover]]''' \u2013 Modified version of the 748 design for the Royal Air Force.

The 51 people on board survived. This was the first accident that resulted in a write-off on an Avro 748 / HS748.\n* On 15 August 1967, two accidents involving HS-748-222 Series 2 aircraft of Channel Airways Limited, occurred roughly 90 minutes apart at Portsmouth Airport. In the first incident, G-ATEK, operating a scheduled service from Southend to Paris, via Portsmouth, landed in rainy conditions and was unable to stop in the available distance on the grass runway. The aircraft slid sideways, left the runway and stopped on an embankment. Some 90 minutes later, aircraft G-ATEH, operating a scheduled service from Jersey, via Guernsey to Portsmouth, landed and slid on the runway, crashed through a perimeter fence and came to rest on the main Eastern Road. There were no injuries in either accident, but both aircraft sustained serious damage.

The profound crisis of our era is, in essence, the conflict between the Social Engineers, who seek to adjust mankind to scientific utopias, and the disciples of Truth, who defend the organic moral order. We believe that truth is neither arrived at nor illuminated by monitoring election results, binding though these are for other purposes, but by other means, including a study of human experience.

They are committed, says [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], to the belief in America's \"superiority against the cold reactionary monarchical and more rigidly status-bound system of European society.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Modern Free Society and Its Nemesis: Liberty Versus Conservatism in the New Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEl91MbLiO0C&pg=PA44|year=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|pages=44\u201345|isbn=9780739115169}}</ref>\n\n=== Ideology and political philosophy ===\nIn terms of governmental economic policies, American conservatives have been heavily influenced by the [[classical liberal]] or [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] tradition as expressed by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] and a major source of influence has been the [[Chicago school of economics]]. They have been strongly opposed to [[Keynesian economics]].<ref>George H.

Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives\u2014the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\".<ref>Grover Cleveland, \"The President's message, 1887\" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"[[free market]] economics\" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite journal|title=True believers|journal=The Economist\n|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/06/conservatives-0\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallup Poll\">{{cite web|title=In U.S., Nearly Half Identify as Economically Conservative|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/154889/Nearly-Half-Identify-Economically-Conservative.aspx\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy.

They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country.\n\nSocial conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref>Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W.

Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archivedate=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century\u2014the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.\u2014both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh\u00f6ffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F. Hayward, ''The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution 1980\u20131989'' (2009), p. 477.</ref> Reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit, but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product. Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%.

Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946\u20131947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, \"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945\u20131950,\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479\u201388.</ref>\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9\u201311, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<ref>Timothy J Lynch, ed.

Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319\u2013334.</ref><ref>William M.

Since 1964, the conservatives largely took control. Meanwhile, the conservative wing of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], based in the South and strongly opposed to [[Civil Rights]], grew weaker. The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3\u20131 Democratic to 3\u20131 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes\u2014for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the [[Cato Institute]], and libertarian intellectuals such as [[David Boaz]] describe libertarianism as being \"socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"<ref name=Moseley>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Daniel|title=What is Libertarianism?|journal=Basic Income Studies|date=June 25, 2011|volume=6|issue=2|page=2|ssrn=1872578|accessdate=|doi=10.1515/1932-0183.1215}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Boaz|first=David|title=The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarian-vote-age-obama|work=Policy Analysis|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=February 24, 2012|author2=David Kirby|date=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support [[protectionism]] instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Geography ===\n[[File:Conservative Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|Percent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010:{{update inline|date=January 2019}}<ref name=\"gallup-consverative-poll\">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Wyoming, Mississippi, Utah Rank as Most Conservative States|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141677/Wyoming-Mississippi-Utah-Rank-Conservative-States.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{legend|#ca2521;|49% and above}}\n{{legend|#d54a42;|45\u201348%}}\n{{legend|#df7064;|41\u201344%}}\n{{legend|#ea9585;|37\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#f4baa6;|33\u201336%}}\n{{legend|#ffe0c8;|32% and under}}\n]]\nThe [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountain states]], and [[Alaska]] are generally conservative strongholds.

Russello described as follows:\n# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].\n# An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence.\n# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.\n# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.\n# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.\n# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\" ''Modern Age'' 38: 354\u2013363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>\n\nKirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are \"unimaginable apart from one another\"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S.

In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[Conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937\u201360.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V.

Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7\u201311, 208.</ref>\n\n==== Federalism ====\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\n<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.<ref>Center for the Study of Federalism, \"U.S. Constitution'' (2017) [http://encyclopedia.federalism.org/index.php/U.S._Constitution online].</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights have been a \"Fig Leaf for conservatives\":\n<blockquote>Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups.

This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933\u20131938) and the Great Society (1964\u20131966).<ref name=\"Jefferson Cowie 2008\">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\" ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3\u201332.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated.

He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Elihu Root]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism\u2014especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K.

Kirk's use of the word \"prejudice\" here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.\n\nThere are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives\u2014the traditional and the religious. Traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct, especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization. For example, traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat. Religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code. In the United States, this translates into hard-line stances on moral issues, such as [[opposition to abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]. Religious conservatives often assert that \"America is a Christian nation\" and call for laws that enforce [[Christian morality]].\n\nFiscal conservatives support limited government, low tax, low spending, and a balanced budget. They argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone, and, as President Grover Cleveland said, \"unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation\".<ref>Grover Cleveland, \"The President's message, 1887\" (1887) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4cApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&dq=%22unnecessary+taxation+is+unjust+taxation%22+Grover+OR+Cleveland&hl=en&ei=wQnkTePyOOfeiAKJ0Y2TBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK online p. 37]</ref> A recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a [[death tax]]. Fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry. Some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies. Others, such as some libertarians and followers of [[Ludwig von Mises]], believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful, corrupt, and immoral. More moderate fiscal conservatives argue that \"[[free market]] economics\" is the most efficient way to promote [[economic growth]].\n\nMany modern American fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the Constitution. However, some American fiscal conservatives view wider social liberalism as an impetus for increased spending on these programs. As such, fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies, and is often influenced by coinciding levels of social conservatism.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite journal|title=True believers|journal=The Economist\n|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/06/conservatives-0\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallup Poll\">{{cite web|title=In U.S., Nearly Half Identify as Economically Conservative|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/154889/Nearly-Half-Identify-Economically-Conservative.aspx\n|accessdate=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThrough much of the 20th century, a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism, and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists, was opposition to communism, which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order, but also the enemy of Western freedom and democracy.

They often denounce anti-war protesters and support the police and the military. They hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor, duty, courage, loyalty, and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country.\n\nSocial conservatives are strongest in the South and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref>Darren Dochuk, ''From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism'' (W.W.

Fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics; they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people, and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators. A political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as [[starve the beast]]. Activist [[Grover Norquist]] is a well-known proponent of the strategy and has famously said, \"My goal is to cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041120220704/http://www.ppionline.org/ndol/print.cfm?contentid=251788 |archivedate=November 20, 2004 |title=Starving the Beast |author=Ed Kilgore |work=Blueprint Magazine |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=9335 |title=Article &#124; The American Prospect |publisher=Prospect.org |date=March 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The argument in favor of [[balanced budget]]s is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low, which implies relatively small government institutions.\n\nThis belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism that wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement ''laissez-faire'' policies. This economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought: the classical liberals' pragmatism and the libertarians' notion of \"rights.\" The classical liberal maintains that free markets work best, while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets.\n\nHistorian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that [[classical liberalism in the United States]] during the 19th century had distinctive characteristics as opposed to Britain:\n<blockquote>[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe economic philosophy of American conservatives tends to be more liberal allowing for more [[economic freedom]]. [[Economic liberalism]] can go well beyond fiscal conservatism's concern for fiscal prudence, to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets. It is also sometimes extended to a broader [[small government]] philosophy. Economic liberalism is associated with [[free-market]] or ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics.\n\nInsofar as it is ideological, economic liberalism owes its creation to the [[classical liberal]] tradition in the vein of [[Adam Smith]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]].\n\nClassical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral, ideological grounds: principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets. Supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.\n\nModern conservatives, on the other hand, derive support for free markets from practical grounds. They argue that free markets are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the [[Burkean]] notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.\n\nA belief in the importance of the [[civil society]] is another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy. As noted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society. These responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government, requiring higher taxes. In his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Tocqueville described this as \"soft oppression\".\n\n[[File:Ronald Reagan TV Address 1981.ogv|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] gives a televised address from the [[Oval Office]], outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 (excerpt)]]\nWhile classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically, in recent years the lines have blurred. Rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are \"simply more productive\" or \"simply the right thing to do\" but a combination of both. This blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the \"umbrella\" of the conservative movement.\n\nThe archetypal free-market conservative administrations of the late 20th century\u2014the [[Margaret Thatcher]] government in Britain and the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the U.S.\u2014both held unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism.<ref>Dieter Plehwe, Bernhard Walpen, Gisela Neunh\u00f6ffer (eds), ''Neoliberal Hegemony: A Global Critique,'' [[Routledge]] (February 8, 2006), {{ISBN|0415460034}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kiaxAx5l1QEC&pg=PA1 p. 1].</ref> To that end, Thatcher privatized industries and public housing, and Reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28% to 20%, though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28%. Reagan also cut individual income-tax rates, lowering the maximum rate from 70% to 28%. He increased defense spending, but liberal Democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending.<ref>Steven F. Hayward, ''The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution 1980\u20131989'' (2009), p. 477.</ref> Reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit, but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product. Federal revenues as a percent of the GDP fell from 19.6% in 1981 when Reagan took office to 18.3% in 1989 when he left. Federal spending fell slightly from 22.2% of the GDP to 21.2%.

This mode of thinking tends to espouse ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and a critical view of the federal government.

Political conservatism has been an important aspect of the American Legion since the 1920s. The American Legion always paid very close attention to domestic subversion, especially the threat of domestic communism. However, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. During World War II, it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946\u20131947, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.<ref>Morten Bach, \"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945\u20131950,\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) [https://search.proquest.com/openview/15fb275644e81638d7f181805d0899c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y Excerpt]</ref> Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the ''American Legion Firing Line,'' a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the [[John Birch Society]] and anti-Semitic groups. By the late 1950s, the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.<ref>Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'' (1999) pp  479\u201388.</ref>\n\nThe Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961, the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. The Legion publications typically hailed Barry Goldwater, a member, as a political role model, but like Goldwater and William F. Buckley, they rejected the extremism of the [[John Birch Society]]. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam and support of anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan.  The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the American Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush's intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9\u201311, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<ref>Timothy J Lynch, ed.

Vitale]] decision banned state-written prayers in public schools. White evangelicals mostly supported that decision. However, they saw the 1963 [[Abington School District v. Schempp]] decision to ban school-sponsored Bible reading and school-organized praying of the Lord's Prayer from those schools as an affront. The Supreme Court ruled that prayer organized by the school was not voluntary since students were coerced or publicly embarrassed if they did not follow along. Nevertheless, the conservatives continued to call for voluntary school prayer, which is already protected under law, and repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court on this issue and on other issues, especially abortion. The evangelicals had long been avid supporters of the public schools. Now they had to reconsider their place in both schools and society as a whole. They concluded with surprising unanimity that those school decisions had done more than forced evangelical belief out of America's public schools; the decisions had pushed evangelicals themselves out of America's mainstream culture. Alienated, they moved into the [[Christian Right|religious right]] and by 1980 were avid supporters of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=The Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&pg=PA357|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=357|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref><ref>Adam Laats, \"Our schools, our country: American evangelicals, public schools, and the Supreme Court decisions of 1962 and 1963.\" ''Journal of religious history'' 36.3 (2012): 319\u2013334.</ref><ref>William M.

Many believe that government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce self-reliance. Most conservatives oppose [[affirmative action]] policies, that is, policies in employment, education, and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against. Conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as \"[[reverse discrimination]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nConservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work. However, conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations (especially faith-based charities) in helping the poor.\n\n=== Social issues ===\nOn social issues, many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles.

The most dramatic realignment took place within the White South, which moved from 3\u20131 Democratic to 3\u20131 Republican between 1960 and 2000.\n\nIn addition, some American libertarians, in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and even some in the Republican Party, see themselves as conservative, even though they advocate significant economic and social changes\u2014for instance, further dismantling the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare system]] or liberalizing drug policy. They see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional American value. However, many libertarian think-tanks such as the [[Cato Institute]], and libertarian intellectuals such as [[David Boaz]] describe libertarianism as being \"socially liberal and fiscally conservative.\"<ref name=Moseley>{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Daniel|title=What is Libertarianism?|journal=Basic Income Studies|date=June 25, 2011|volume=6|issue=2|page=2|ssrn=1872578|accessdate=|doi=10.1515/1932-0183.1215}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Boaz|first=David|title=The Libertarian Vote in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/libertarian-vote-age-obama|work=Policy Analysis|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=February 24, 2012|author2=David Kirby|date=January 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some conservatives tend to oppose free-market trade policies and support [[protectionism]] instead. They want government intervention to support the economy and protect American jobs. They oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries (especially China) at the expense of American workers. However, in spite of their support for protectionism, they tend to support other free-market principles like low taxes, small government and balanced budgets.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Geography ===\n[[File:Conservative Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|Percent of self-identified conservatives by state in 2010:{{update inline|date=January 2019}}<ref name=\"gallup-consverative-poll\">{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Jeffrey|title=Wyoming, Mississippi, Utah Rank as Most Conservative States|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/141677/Wyoming-Mississippi-Utah-Rank-Conservative-States.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref>\n{{legend|#ca2521;|49% and above}}\n{{legend|#d54a42;|45\u201348%}}\n{{legend|#df7064;|41\u201344%}}\n{{legend|#ea9585;|37\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#f4baa6;|33\u201336%}}\n{{legend|#ffe0c8;|32% and under}}\n]]\nThe [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Plains]], the [[Rocky Mountain states]], and [[Alaska]] are generally conservative strongholds.

Russello described as follows:\n# A belief in a transcendent order, which Kirk described variously as based in tradition, [[divine revelation]], or [[natural law]].\n# An affection for the \"variety and mystery\" of human existence.\n# A conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions.\n# A belief that property and freedom are closely linked.\n# A faith in custom, convention, and prescription.\n# A recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs, which entails a respect for the political value of prudence.<ref>Russello, Gerald J., 1996, \"The Jurisprudence of Russell Kirk,\" ''Modern Age'' 38: 354\u2013363. {{ISSN|0026-7457}}.</ref>\n\nKirk said that Christianity and [[Western culture|Western civilization]] are \"unimaginable apart from one another\"<ref>[http://www.robertsgriffin.com/ConservBookshelf.pdf Book Review] by Robert S.

In 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts. Taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 GOP nomination. Taft and the conservative Republicans controlled the Supreme Court until the late 1930s.<ref>Lewis L. Gould, ''The William Howard Taft Presidency'' (2009) p. 175</ref><ref>Mark A. Graber and Michael Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p. 111.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a liberal Democrat, did not attack the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] directly in 1937, but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices. Conservative Democrats immediately broke with FDR, defeated his proposal, and built up the [[Conservative coalition]]. While the liberals did take over the Court through replacements, they lost control of Congress. That is, the Court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by Congress, but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937\u201360.<ref>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) p. 525.</ref>\n\nConservatives' views of the courts are based on their beliefs: maintaining the present state of affairs, conventional and rule-oriented, and disapproval of government power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/conservatives-and-the-court|title=Conservatives and the Court|access-date=October 24, 2018}}</ref> A recent variant of conservatism condemns \"judicial activism\"; that is, judges using their decisions to control policy, along the lines of the [[Warren Court]] in the 1960s. It came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting, desegregation, and the rights of those accused of crimes. This position goes back to Jefferson's vehement attacks on federal judges and to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s attacks on the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1857.<ref>Graber and Perhac, ''Marbury versus Madison: documents and commentary'' (2002) p114</ref><ref>Mark V. Tushnet, ''A Court Divided: The Rehnquist Court and the Future of Constitutional Law'' (2005) p. 338.</ref>\n\n==== Originalism ====\n{{main|Originalism}}\nA more recent variant that emerged in the 1980s is [[originalism]], the assertion that the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted to the maximum extent possible in the light of what it meant when it was adopted. Originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology, [[strict constructionism]], which deals with the interpretation of the Constitution as written, but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted. In modern times, the term originalism has been used by Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]], former federal judge [[Robert Bork]] and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs.<ref>Johnathan O'Neill, ''Originalism in American law and politics: a constitutional history'' (2005) pp. 7\u201311, 208.</ref>\n\n==== Federalism ====\nAccording to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for the majority in Gregory v. Ashcroft 501 U.S. 452 (1991), there are significant advantages to federalism and the recognition of state rights:\n<blockquote>The federalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages. It assures a decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society; it increases opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes; it allows for more innovation and experimentation in government; and it makes government more responsive by putting the States in competition for a mobile citizenry.<ref>Center for the Study of Federalism, \"U.S. Constitution'' (2017) [http://encyclopedia.federalism.org/index.php/U.S._Constitution online].</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom the left, law professor Herman Schwartz argues that Rehnquist's reliance on federalism and state's rights have been a \"Fig Leaf for conservatives\":\n<blockquote>Today's conservative Supreme Court majority, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, has imposed limitations on federal power to curtail the rights of women, religious groups, the elderly, racial minorities, and other disadvantaged groups. [...] The conservatives have shrunk the scope of the commerce clause, developed implied limitations on federal authority, and narrowly construed the Civil War amendments.<ref>Herman Schwartz, \"The Supreme Court's federalism: Fig leaf for conservatives.\" The ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 574.1 (2001): 119\u2013131.

Labor historians Jefferson Cowie and Nick Salvatore argue the New Deal was a short-term response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state, claiming that America has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time. This new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated American politics since the 1920s, with the brief exceptions of the New Deal era (1933\u20131938) and the Great Society (1964\u20131966).<ref name=\"Jefferson Cowie 2008\">Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\" ''International Labor & Working-Class History,'' (2008) 74: 3\u201332.</ref> However, historian Julian Zelizer argues that \"The coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated.

He wrote, \"The Right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine Right: it was led by the rich and well-placed; it was skeptical of popular government; it was opposed to all parties, unions, leagues, or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit; it was politically, socially, and culturally anti-radical.\" His \"giants of American conservatism\" were [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Elihu Root]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He added that Washington and Lincoln transcend the usual categories, but that conservatives \"may argue with some conviction that Washington and Lincoln can also be added to his list.\"\n\nRossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries. Among the fathers of the Constitution, which he calls \"a triumph of conservative statesmanship\", Rossiter said conservatives may \"take special pride\" in [[James Madison]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and the Pinckneys of South Carolina. For the early 19th century, Rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against [[Jacksonian democracy]] include [[Joseph Story]] and [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] in Massachusetts; Chancellor [[James Kent]] in New York; [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] in Virginia.\n\nIn the decades around 1900, Rossiter finds that [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Elihu Root]], [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] \"were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy.\" In what Rossiter called the \"Great Train Robbery of Intellectual History\", the laissez-faire conservatives appropriated the themes of classical liberalism\u2014especially liberty, opportunity, progress, and individualism, and packaged them into an ideology that supported the property rights of big corporations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard K.
