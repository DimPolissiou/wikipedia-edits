It was the first film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[57th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Supporting Actress (Close), and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ([[Kim Basinger]]). Many of the baseball scenes were filmed in 1983 at [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], built in 1937 and demolished in 1988. [[All-High Stadium]], also in Buffalo, stood in for [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]] in a key scene.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910s Nebraska, young Roy Hobbs learns to play baseball from his father, who suffers an early fatal heart attack near an oak tree. When lightning strikes that same tree, splintering it, Hobbs makes a baseball bat from the wood, burning a lightning bolt and the name \u201cWonderboy\u201d into the barrel.\n\nNow 19 years old, Hobbs heads to Chicago for a tryout with the [[Chicago Cubs]], leaving behind his girlfriend, Iris. En route on the train, he meets legendary ballplayer the \u201cWhammer\u201d and sportswriter Max Mercy. On a stopover at a carnival, Hobbs wins a bet to strike out Whammer on three pitches. The feat catches the attention of Harriet Bird, a mysterious woman also traveling on the train who was previously fawning over Whammer.\n\nIn Chicago, Harriet invites Hobbs to her hotel room. She asks if Hobbs's claim that he can be \u201cthe best there ever was,\u201d is true, and he confidently avers it is. Harriet aims a handgun at Hobbs and shoots him in the abdomen. It is learned that Harriet, who commits suicide, previously targeted other top athletes.\n\nSixteen years later, Hobbs is signed as a rookie to the New York Knights, a struggling ball club sitting in last place. Manager Pop Fisher is furious that Hobbs was recruited, believing him too old. He initially refuses to play Hobbs but finally relents. At his first batting practice, Hobbs amazes the entire team with his powerful hitting. The following game, Pop benches star outfielder Bump Bailey after a reckless play. Pop [[pinch hit]]s with Hobbs, who literally knocks the baseball's cover off. Shortly after, Bailey tragically dies crashing through an outfield wall, resulting in Hobbs being made starting outfielder. Hobbs becomes a sensation and the Knights\u2019 fortunes turn around. Mercy finds Hobbs to be familiar but fails to recognize him as the pitcher who once struck out the Whammer.\n\nAssistant manager Red Blow tells Hobbs that if Pop loses the pennant this year, then his Knight's ownership share will revert to the team's majority owner, the Judge. Pop will permanently be out of the sport. Hobbs privately meets with the Judge who offers him $5,000 to throw the season. Hobbs, unlike Bump Bailey, refuses the bribe.\n\nMercy introduces Hobbs to Gus Sands, a bookie whom Hobbs learns places large bets against him. He also meets Pop's niece, Memo Paris, who was Bump's girlfriend. Their budding relationship results in a distracted Hobbs\u2019 game slumping. Pop privately cautions Hobbs about Memo, who appears to be working for the Judge, though Hobbs dismisses his concerns.\n\nHobbs' slump continues until a game against the Cubs at [[Wrigley Field]], during which a woman in white stands up in the bleachers, catching Hobbs\u2019 attention. He then hits a home run, shattering the clock on the scoreboard. He realizes the woman is Iris, and the two later meet at a diner. They discuss their respective lives, though Hobbs avoids mentioning what happened to him. When they meet the next day, Hobbs tells Iris the truth. Iris, who is unmarried and works in [[Chicago]], shares that she has a son whose father lives in [[New York City]]. The reunion restores Hobbs' hitting prowess, and the Knights surge into first place. During a practice session, Mercy watches Hobbs pitching and suddenly remembers him.\n  \nAt a team party, Hobbs collapses in pain and awakens in a hospital. A silver bullet removed from his stomach has caused long-term damage that could prove fatal if Hobbs continues playing baseball. He learns the Knights have since lost three games in a row, which sets up a one-game playoff against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Memo visits Hobbs in the hospital and urges him to accept the Judge's bribe, which has been quadrupled, and to walk away. The Judge tells Hobbs to consider his offer and threatens to publicly expose Hobbs' past and reveals that another team member is being bribed. Hobbs again rejects the Judge's offer. When Iris visits Hobbs, she assures him he has not wasted his potential and is a great ballplayer.\n\nHobbs, still recovering, returns to the team wanting to play. Pop tells Hobbs that he is the best player he has ever seen and says to suit up. As the game progresses, Hobbs realizes that Knights pitcher Al Fowler is the bribed player. Hobbs confronts Fowler on the field, warning him not to throw the game. Fowler starts pitching competitively and the Knights stay in the game. Watching from the stands with her son, Iris begs an usher to deliver a note to Hobbs in the dugout, telling him that she has brought their son to watch him play.\n\nIn the ninth inning, the Knights trail the Pirates when the latter brings in a young, hard-throwing pitcher. Seeing that Hobbs is hampered by his old wound, the pitcher throws inside trying to harm him. Hobbs hits a foul but has struck the ball so hard that his bat, Wonderboy, splits in half. Hobbs asks Bobby the bat boy to pick a replacement. Bobby brings him his own bat, the \u201cSavoy Special\u201d, that Hobbs helped him make. Hobbs, down to his last strike, his wound bleeding through his jersey, hits the ball, smashing it into the stadium lights, winning the game and the National League pennant. The Knights advance to the World Series, though the outcome is not revealed. \n\nThe victory secures Pop's share of the team and his place on it. At the end, Hobbs is seen playing catch with his son in the same field that he and his father played in many years earlier, while Iris looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Roy Hobbs\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Max Mercy\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Iris Gaines\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Memo Paris\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Pop Fisher\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Harriet Bird\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as The Judge\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Red Blow\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as \"The Whammer\"\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Gus Sands (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Bartholomew \"Bump\" Bailey\n* [[John P.

It was the first film produced by [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[57th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Supporting Actress (Close), and it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ([[Kim Basinger]]). Many of the baseball scenes were filmed in 1983 at [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], built in 1937 and demolished in 1988. [[All-High Stadium]], also in Buffalo, stood in for [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]] in a key scene.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910s Nebraska, young Roy Hobbs learns to play baseball from his father, who suffers an early fatal heart attack. When lightning strikes an oak tree, splintering it, Hobbs makes a baseball bat from the wood, burning a lightning bolt and the name \u201cWonderboy\u201d into the barrel.\n\nNow 19 years old, Hobbs heads to Chicago for a tryout with the [[Chicago Cubs]], leaving behind his girlfriend, Iris. En route on the train, he meets legendary ballplayer the \u201cWhammer\u201d and sportswriter Max Mercy. On a stopover at a carnival, Hobbs wins a bet to strike out Whammer on three pitches. The feat catches the attention of Harriet Bird, a mysterious woman also traveling on the train who was previously fawning over Whammer.\n\nIn Chicago, Harriet invites Hobbs to her hotel room. She asks if Hobbs's claim that he can be \u201cthe best there ever was,\u201d is true, and he confidently avers it is. Harriet aims a handgun at Hobbs and shoots him in the abdomen. It is learned that Harriet, who commits suicide, previously targeted other top athletes.\n\nSixteen years later, Hobbs is signed as a rookie to the New York Knights, a struggling ball club sitting in last place. Manager Pop Fisher is furious that Hobbs was recruited, believing him too old. He initially refuses to play Hobbs but finally relents. At his first batting practice, Hobbs amazes the entire team with his powerful hitting. The following game, Pop benches star outfielder Bump Bailey after a reckless play. Pop [[pinch hit]]s with Hobbs, who literally knocks the baseball's cover off. Shortly after, Bailey tragically dies crashing through an outfield wall, resulting in Hobbs being made starting outfielder. Hobbs becomes a sensation and the Knights\u2019 fortunes turn around. Mercy finds Hobbs to be familiar but fails to recognize him as the pitcher who once struck out the Whammer.\n\nAssistant manager Red Blow tells Hobbs that if Pop loses the pennant this year, then his Knight's ownership share will revert to the team's majority owner, the Judge. Pop will permanently be out of the sport. Hobbs privately meets with the Judge who offers him $5,000 to throw the season. Hobbs, unlike Bump Bailey, refuses the bribe.\n\nMercy introduces Hobbs to Gus Sands, a bookie whom Hobbs learns places large bets against him. He also meets Pop's niece, Memo Paris, who was Bump's girlfriend. Their budding relationship results in a distracted Hobbs\u2019 game slumping. Pop privately cautions Hobbs about Memo, who appears to be working for the Judge, though Hobbs dismisses his concerns.\n\nHobbs' slump continues until a game against the Cubs at [[Wrigley Field]], during which a woman in white stands up in the bleachers, catching Hobbs\u2019 attention. He then hits a home run, shattering the clock on the scoreboard. He realizes the woman is Iris, and the two later meet at a diner. They discuss their respective lives, though Hobbs avoids mentioning what happened to him. When they meet the next day, Hobbs tells Iris the truth. Iris, who is unmarried and works in [[Chicago]], shares that she has a son whose father lives in [[New York City]]. The reunion restores Hobbs' hitting prowess, and the Knights surge into first place. During a practice session, Mercy watches Hobbs pitching and suddenly remembers him.\n  \nAt a team party, Hobbs collapses in pain and awakens in a hospital. A silver bullet removed from his stomach has caused long-term damage that could prove fatal if Hobbs continues playing baseball. He learns the Knights have since lost three games in a row, which sets up a one-game playoff against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. Memo visits Hobbs in the hospital and urges him to accept the Judge's bribe, which has been quadrupled, and to walk away. The Judge tells Hobbs to consider his offer and threatens to publicly expose Hobbs' past and reveals that another team member is being bribed. Hobbs again rejects the Judge's offer. When Iris visits Hobbs, she assures him he has not wasted his potential and is a great ballplayer.\n\nHobbs, still recovering, returns to the team wanting to play. Pop tells Hobbs that he is the best player he has ever seen and says to suit up. As the game progresses, Hobbs realizes that Knights pitcher Al Fowler is the bribed player. Hobbs confronts Fowler on the field, warning him not to throw the game. Fowler starts pitching competitively and the Knights stay in the game. Watching from the stands with her son, Iris begs an usher to deliver a note to Hobbs in the dugout, telling him that she has brought their son to watch him play.\n\nIn the ninth inning, the Knights trail the Pirates when the latter brings in a young, hard-throwing pitcher. Seeing that Hobbs is hampered by his old wound, the pitcher throws inside trying to harm him. Hobbs hits a foul but has struck the ball so hard that his bat, Wonderboy, splits in half. Hobbs asks Bobby the bat boy to pick a replacement. Bobby brings him his own bat, the \u201cSavoy Special\u201d, that Hobbs helped him make. Hobbs, down to his last strike, his wound bleeding through his jersey, hits the ball, smashing it into the stadium lights, winning the game and the National League pennant. The Knights advance to the World Series, though the outcome is not revealed. \n\nThe victory secures Pop's share of the team and his place on it. At the end, Hobbs is seen playing catch with his son in the same field that he and his father played in many years earlier, while Iris looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Roy Hobbs\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Max Mercy\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Iris Gaines\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Memo Paris\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Pop Fisher\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Harriet Bird\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as The Judge\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Red Blow\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as \"The Whammer\"\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as Gus Sands (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Bartholomew \"Bump\" Bailey\n* [[John P.

Under orders from Dr. [[Luther Gulick (physician)|Luther Gulick]], head of physical education there, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an \"athletic distraction\"; Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape<ref name=mcgill/> and explicitly emphasized to \"make it fair for all players and not too rough\".<ref name=hofsummary/>\n\nIn his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts.<ref name=museumtimeline/> Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of those times (rugby, lacrosse, [[Association football|soccer]], football, [[ice hockey|hockey]], and [[baseball]]); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big, soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft, lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game [[duck on a rock]].

In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: \"When Mr. Stubbins brot {{sic}} up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball, and awaited the arrival of the class ... The class did not show much enthusiasm, but followed my lead ... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men and tried to keep them somewhat near the rules.

I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began. ... The boys began tackling, kicking, and punching in the clinches. They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. [The injury toll: several black eyes, one separated shoulder, and one player knocked unconscious.] \"It certainly was murder.\" [Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport.]  The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball.

It used a peach basket attached to the wall.]]\nAt the Springfield YMCA, Naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh [[New England]] winter, thus was perpetually short-tempered. Under orders from Dr. [[Luther Gulick (physician)|Luther Gulick]], head of physical education there, Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an \"athletic distraction\"; Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room, could help its track athletes to keep in shape<ref name=mcgill/> and explicitly emphasized to \"make it fair for all players and not too rough\".<ref name=hofsummary/>\n\nIn his attempt to think up a new game, Naismith was guided by three main thoughts.<ref name=museumtimeline/> Firstly, he analyzed the most popular games of those times (rugby, lacrosse, [[Association football|soccer]], football, [[ice hockey|hockey]], and [[baseball]]); Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big, soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it, so he decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, namely placing it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he forced the players to throw a soft, lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game [[duck on a rock]]. Naismith christened this new game \"Basket Ball\"<ref name=museumtimeline/> and put his thoughts together in [[James Naismith's Original Rules of Basketball|13 basic rules]].<ref name=13rules>{{cite web \n |last=Naismith \n |first=James \n |title=Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of Basketball \n |work=National Collegiate Athletic Association \n |url=https://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/basketball/original_rules.html \n |accessdate=September 30, 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408185146/http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/basketball/original_rules.html \n |archivedate=April 8, 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n }}</ref>\n\nThe first game of \"Basket Ball\" was played in December 1891. In a handwritten report, Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: \"When Mr. Stubbins brot {{sic}} up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball, and awaited the arrival of the class ... The class did not show much enthusiasm, but followed my lead ... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men and tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon.\"<ref name=firstgame>{{cite web\n  | last = Naismith\n  | first = James\n  | title = James Naismith Handwritten Manuscript Detailing First Basketball Game\n  | work = Heritage Auction Galleries\n  | url= http://sports.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=706&Lot_No=19007&type=prte-pr11136b&ic=| accessdate = September 30, 2008 }}</ref> In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the [[dribbling|dribble]].

I blew a whistle, and the first game of basketball began. ... The boys began tackling, kicking, and punching in the clinches. They ended up in a free-for-all in the middle of the gym floor. [The injury toll: several black eyes, one separated shoulder, and one player knocked unconscious.] \"It certainly was murder.\" [Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport.]  The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball.

Johansen is a [[autodidact|self-trained]] [[software engineer]], who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006.

Retrieved on 2010-06-29.</ref>\n\n== DeCSS prosecution ==\nAfter Johansen released [[DeCSS]], he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''\u00d8kokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.\n\nTwo further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. \u00d8kokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case.\n\nJohansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. \u00d8kokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n==Other projects==\n{{proseline|section|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen's career has included many other projects.\n\n===2001===\nIn 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.\n\n===2003===\nIn November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store. Although these resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of release, they represent the first attempt at circumventing Apple's encryption.\n\n===2004===\nJohansen had by now become a [[VideoLAN]] developer, and had reverse engineered [[FairPlay]] and written VLC's FairPlay support.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | title=DVD Jon on VLC and Apple's iTunes singles | publisher=Boing Boing | first=Cory | last=Doctorow | authorlink=Cory Doctorow | date=2004-03-26 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093239/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref> It has been available in VideoLAN [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).\n\nOn April 25, 2004 Johansen released yet another program: DeDRMS.

On March 22, Apple released a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the iTunes Music Store blocking the use of his PyMusique program. The same day, an update to PyMusique was released, circumventing the new patch.\n\nOn June 26, 2005, Johansen created a modification of Google's new in-browser video player (which was based on the open source VLC media player) in less than 24 hours after its release, to allow the user to play videos that are not hosted on Google\u2019s servers.

He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/about/ | title=About | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | year=2004 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJohansen is featured in the documentary film ''[[Info_Wars_(film)|Info Wars]]''.\n\n==Education==\nIn a post on his blog he said that in the '90s he started with a book (\"Programming the 8086/8088\"), the web (\"[[Fravia]]'s site was a goldmine\") and [[IRC]] (\"Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.\")<ref>Jon Lech Johansen\u2019s blog, [http://nanocr.eu/2006/02/09/reverse-engineering/ \"Reverse Engineering\"], 2006-02-09.

The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''\u00d8kokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.\n\nTwo further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. \u00d8kokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case.\n\nJohansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. \u00d8kokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n==Other projects==\n{{proseline|section|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen's career has included many other projects.\n\n===2001===\nIn 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.\n\n===2003===\nIn November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store. Although these resulting raw AAC files were unplayable by most media players at the time of release, they represent the first attempt at circumventing Apple's encryption.\n\n===2004===\nJohansen had by now become a [[VideoLAN]] developer, and had reverse engineered [[FairPlay]] and written VLC's FairPlay support.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | title=DVD Jon on VLC and Apple's iTunes singles | publisher=Boing Boing | first=Cory | last=Doctorow | authorlink=Cory Doctorow | date=2004-03-26 | accessdate=2007-08-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093239/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/26/dvd_jon_on_vlc_and_a.html | archivedate=2007-08-07 }}</ref> It has been available in VideoLAN [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] since January 2004, but the first release to include FairPlay support is VLC 0.7.1 (released March 2, 2004).\n\nOn April 25, 2004 Johansen released yet another program: DeDRMS.

On March 22, Apple released a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the iTunes Music Store blocking the use of his PyMusique program. The same day, an update to PyMusique was released, circumventing the new patch.\n\nOn June 26, 2005, Johansen created a modification of Google's new in-browser video player (which was based on the open source VLC media player) in less than 24 hours after its release, to allow the user to play videos that are not hosted on Google\u2019s servers.

{"title_page": "True Names", "text_new": "\n\n}}\n\n'''''True Names''''' is a 1981 [[science fiction]] [[novella]] by American writer [[Vernor Vinge]], a seminal work of the [[cyberpunk]] genre. It is one of the earliest stories to present a fully fleshed-out concept of [[cyberspace]], which would later be central to cyberpunk. The story also contains elements of [[transhumanism]], [[anarchism]], and even hints about [[Technological singularity|The Singularity]].\n\n''True Names'' first brought Vinge to prominence as a science fiction writer. It also inspired many real-life hackers and computer scientists; a 2001 book about the novella, ''True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier'', included essays by [[Danny Hillis]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Mark Pesce]], [[Richard Stallman]] and others.<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-86207-7 True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier review], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', December 24, 2001</ref> It was awarded the [[Prometheus_Award#Hall_of_Fame_Award_recipients|Prometheus Hall of Fame Award]] in 2007.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story follows the progress of a group of computer [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]s (called \"warlocks\" in the story) who are [[early adopter (marketing)|early adopters]] of a new full-immersion [[virtual reality]] technology, called the \"Other Plane\". Warlocks penetrate computers around the world for personal profit or curiosity. Forming a cabal, they must keep their [[meatspace|true identities]]\u2014their \"True Names\"\u2014secret even to each other and to the \"Great Adversary\", the [[United States government]], as those who know a warlock's True Name can force him to work on their behalf, or even cause a \"True Death\" by killing the warlock in real life.\n\nThe protagonist is a warlock known as \"Mr. Slippery\" in the Other Plane. The government learns Mr. Slippery's True Name\u2014Roger Pollack, a holonovelist in [[Arcata, California]]\u2014and forces him to investigate the Mailman, a mysterious new warlock which it suspects of conducting a large-scale subversion of databases and networks. The Mailman has been recruiting others, such as the warlock DON.MAC, by promising great power in the real world, and claims to be responsible for a recent revolution in [[Venezuela]]. Because he never appears in the Other Plane, and reacts to events only after a significant delay, Mr. Slippery and fellow warlock Erythrina begin to suspect that the Mailman may be an extraterrestrial invader, subverting global databases to gradually conquer the Earth while causing True Deaths of the warlocks he recruits.\n\nMr. Slippery and Erythrina receive permission from the government to use the old [[Arpanet]] to access massive amounts of computational power around the world as they search for the Mailman. As they become the most powerful warlocks in history they realize that DON.MAC is a sophisticated \"[[artificial intelligence|personality simulator]]\" working for the Mailman. It violently defends itself, and both sides use network connections to military weaponry to attack in the real world. Erythrina is forced to reveal her True Name to Mr. Slippery as the battles, real and virtual, cause global chaos. They succeed in destroying the many copies of the Mailman's AI, and although tempted to keep their power over the world realize that they do not wish to be tyrants.\n\nTen weeks after the war and resulting worldwide [[economic depression]] from the disruption in computer systems, Mr. Slippery returns to the Coven and learns that the Mailman may have survived. Fearing that Erythrina succumbed to temptation for power, Pollack visits her\u2014Debbie Charteris of [[Providence, Rhode Island]]\u2014in person. The elderly Charteris, an early military computer programmer, reveals that the Mailman was not an extraterrestrial, but a [[National Security Agency]] AI research project to protect government systems. Mistakenly left running, it slowly grew in power and sophistication, and used non real-time communication to disguise its inability to fully emulate the human mind. As Charteris succumbs to senility she transfers more of her personality to the defeated Mailman's [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]], and tells Pollack that \"when this body dies, I will still be, and you can still talk to me\".\n\n==Afterword==\n\nMinsky's afterword reviews ideas from his [[Society of Mind]] concept: the idea \"that there is, inside the cranium, perhaps as many as a hundred different kinds of computers, each with a somewhat different basic architecture\", which specialize in different tasks and communicate, though perhaps only crudely. Minsky considers our conscious minds to be higher-level executives, which don't really understand the inner workings of the subcomponents but rather select \"simple names from menu-lists of symbols which appear, from time to time, upon our mental screen-displays.\" Tying this back to virtual reality, Minsky suggests that \"we, ourselves, already exist as processes imprisoned in machines inside machines!

As Charteris succumbs to senility she transfers more of her personality to the defeated Mailman's [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]], and tells Pollack that \"when this body dies, I will still be, and you can still talk to me\".\n\n==Afterword==\n\nMinsky's afterword reviews ideas from his [[Society of Mind]] concept: the idea \"that there is, inside the cranium, perhaps as many as a hundred different kinds of computers, each with a somewhat different basic architecture\", which specialize in different tasks and communicate, though perhaps only crudely. Minsky considers our conscious minds to be higher-level executives, which don't really understand the inner workings of the subcomponents but rather select \"simple names from menu-lists of symbols which appear, from time to time, upon our mental screen-displays.\" Tying this back to virtual reality, Minsky suggests that \"we, ourselves, already exist as processes imprisoned in machines inside machines!

For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0. This is called an \"angle-based\" right triangle. A \"side-based\" right triangle is one in which the lengths of the sides form ratios of [[Natural number|whole numbers]], such as 3&nbsp;:&nbsp;4&nbsp;:&nbsp;5, or of other special numbers such as the [[golden ratio]]. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these special right triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without chuck e cheese\nresorting to more advanced methods.\n\n==Angle-based==\n[[File:Special right triangles for trig.svg|right|thumb|Special angle-based triangles inscribed in a unit circle are handy for visualizing and remembering [[trigonometric functions]] of multiples of 30 and 45 degrees.]]\n\n\"Angle-based\" special right triangles are specified by the relationships of the angles of which the triangle is composed. The angles of these triangles are such that the larger (right) angle, which is 90 degrees or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians, is equal to the sum of the other two angles.\n\nThe side lengths are generally deduced from the basis of the [[unit circle]] or other [[geometry|geometric]] methods.  This approach may be used to rapidly reproduce the values of trigonometric functions for the angles 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0.\n\nSpecial triangles are used to aid in calculating common trigonometric functions, as below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The sides in this triangle are in the ratio 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;:&nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}, which follows immediately from the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nOf all right triangles, the 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 degree triangle has the smallest ratio of the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|2}}.<ref name=PL>Posamentier, Alfred S., and Lehman, Ingmar.

The sides are in the ratio 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;[[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]]&nbsp;:&nbsp;2.\n\nThe proof of this fact is clear using [[trigonometry]].  The [[geometry|geometric]] proof is:\n\n:Draw an equilateral triangle ''ABC'' with side length 2 and with point ''D'' as the midpoint of segment ''BC''.  Draw an altitude line from ''A'' to ''D''.  Then ''ABD'' is a 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle with hypotenuse of length 2, and base ''BD'' of length 1.\n\n:The fact that the remaining leg ''AD'' has length [[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]] follows immediately from the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nThe 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. The proof of this fact is simple and follows on from the fact that if ''\u03b1'', {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b4''}}, {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' + 2''\u03b4''}} are the angles in the progression then the sum of the angles {{nowrap|3''\u03b1'' + 3''\u03b4''}} = 180\u00b0. After dividing by 3, the angle {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b4''}} must be 60\u00b0. The right angle is 90\u00b0, leaving the remaining angle to be 30\u00b0.\n\n==Side-based==\nRight triangles whose sides are of [[integer]] lengths, with the sides collectively known as [[Pythagorean triple]]s, possess angles that cannot all be [[rational numbers]] of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Rational Triangle|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|journal=MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RationalTriangle.html}}</ref>  (This follows from [[Niven's theorem]].) They are most useful in that they may be easily remembered and any [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of the sides produces the same relationship. Using Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples, the sides must be in the ratio\n\n:{{nowrap|''m''{{sup|2}} \u2212 ''n''{{sup|2}} : 2''mn'' : ''m''{{sup|2}} + ''n''{{sup|2}}}}\n\nwhere ''m'' and ''n'' are any positive integers such that {{nowrap|''m'' > ''n''}}.\n\n===Common Pythagorean triples===\n{{Main|Pythagorean triple}}\n\nThere are several Pythagorean triples which are well-known, including those with sides in the ratios:\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n!align=\"right\"|3:||align=\"center\"|4 ||align=\"left\"|:5\n\n|-\n!align=\"right\"|5:||align=\"center\"|12||align=\"left\"|:13\n|-\n!align=\"right\"|8:||align=\"center\"|15||align=\"left\"|:17\n|-\n!align=\"right\"|7:||align=\"center\"|24||align=\"left\"|:25\n|-\n!align=\"right\"|9:||align=\"center\"|40||align=\"left\"|:41\n|}\n\nThe 3&nbsp;:&nbsp;4&nbsp;:&nbsp;5 triangles are the only right triangles with edges in [[arithmetic progression]].

For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45\u00b0\u201345\u00b0\u201390\u00b0. This is called an \"angle-based\" right triangle. A \"side-based\" right triangle is one in which the lengths of the sides form ratios of [[Natural number|whole numbers]], such as 3&nbsp;:&nbsp;4&nbsp;:&nbsp;5, or of other special numbers such as the [[golden ratio]]. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these special right triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without resorting to more advanced methods.\n\n==Angle-based==\n[[File:Special right triangles for trig.svg|right|thumb|Special angle-based triangles inscribed in a unit circle are handy for visualizing and remembering [[trigonometric functions]] of multiples of 30 and 45 degrees.]]\n\n\"Angle-based\" special right triangles are specified by the relationships of the angles of which the triangle is composed. The angles of these triangles are such that the larger (right) angle, which is 90 degrees or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} radians, is equal to the sum of the other two angles.\n\nThe side lengths are generally deduced from the basis of the [[unit circle]] or other [[geometry|geometric]] methods.  This approach may be used to rapidly reproduce the values of trigonometric functions for the angles 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0.\n\nSpecial triangles are used to aid in calculating common trigonometric functions, as below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The sides are in the ratio 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;[[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]]&nbsp;:&nbsp;2.\n\nThe proof of this fact is clear using [[trigonometry]].  The [[geometry|geometric]] proof is:\n\n:Draw an equilateral triangle ''ABC'' with side length 2 and with point ''D'' as the midpoint of segment ''BC''.  Draw an altitude line from ''A'' to ''D''.  Then ''ABD'' is a 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle with hypotenuse of length 2, and base ''BD'' of length 1.\n\n:The fact that the remaining leg ''AD'' has length [[Square root of 3|{{sqrt|3}}]] follows immediately from the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nThe 30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. The proof of this fact is simple and follows on from the fact that if ''\u03b1'', {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b4''}}, {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' + 2''\u03b4''}} are the angles in the progression then the sum of the angles {{nowrap|3''\u03b1'' + 3''\u03b4''}} = 180\u00b0. After dividing by 3, the angle {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b4''}} must be 60\u00b0. The right angle is 90\u00b0, leaving the remaining angle to be 30\u00b0.\n\n==Side-based==\nRight triangles whose sides are of [[integer]] lengths, with the sides collectively known as [[Pythagorean triple]]s, possess angles that cannot all be [[rational numbers]] of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Rational Triangle|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W|journal=MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RationalTriangle.html}}</ref>  (This follows from [[Niven's theorem]].)

After the initial flurry of excitement the partnership failed to produce any further announcements and the service was never heard from again.

He was succeeded by [[Gerald Ford]], whom he had appointed [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. Nixon took office after the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], in which he defeated incumbent Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Although Nixon had built his reputation as a  very active [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican campaigner]], he downplayed partisanship in his 1972 landslide reelection.\n\nNixon's primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs. He focused on [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], easing [[Cold War]] tensions with both countries. As part of this policy, Nixon signed the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] and [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] I, two landmark arms control treaties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Nixon promulgated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for indirect assistance by the United States rather than direct U.S. commitments as seen in the ongoing [[Vietnam War]]. After extensive negotiations with [[North Vietnam]], Nixon withdrew the last U.S. soldiers from [[South Vietnam]] in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. To prevent the possibility of further U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] over Nixon's veto.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Nixon advocated a policy of \"[[New Federalism]],\" in which federal powers and responsibilities would be shifted to the [[U.S. state|states]]. However, he faced a Democratic Congress that did not share his goals and, in some cases, enacted legislation over his veto. Nixon's proposed reform of federal welfare programs did not pass Congress, but Congress did adopt one aspect of his proposal in the form of [[Supplemental Security Income]], which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. The Nixon administration adopted a \"low profile\" on school desegregation, but the administration enforced court desegregation orders and implemented the first [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] plan in the United States. Nixon also presided over the creation of [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the passage of major environmental laws like the [[Clean Water Act]]. Economically, the Nixon years saw the start of a period of \"[[stagflation]]\" that would continue into the 1970s.\n\nNixon was far ahead in the polls in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], but during the campaign, Nixon operatives conducted several illegal operations designed to undermine the opposition. They were exposed when the break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] Headquarters, ended in the arrest of five burglars and gave rise to a congressional investigation. Nixon denied any involvement in the break in, but, after a tape emerged revealing that Nixon had known about the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries shortly after they occurred, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] initiated impeachment proceedings. Facing removal by Congress, Nixon resigned from office. Though some scholars believe that Nixon \"has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues\",{{sfn|Aitken|p=577}} Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|surveys of historians and political scientists]].<ref name=\"brottinghaus\"/><ref name=\"Siena\"/><ref name=\"cspanrankings\"/>\n\n== Election of 1968 ==\n{{further|Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|United States presidential election, 1968}}\n\n===Republican nomination===\n[[Richard Nixon]] had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961, and had been defeated in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] by [[John F.

The United States and Soviet Union had been the clear leaders of their respective blocs of allies during the 1950s, but the world became increasingly multipolar during the 1960s. U.S. allies in Western Europe and East Asia had recovered economically, and while they remained allied with United States, they set their own foreign policies. The fracture in the so-called \"[[Second World]]\" of Communist states was more serious, as the [[Sino-Soviet split|split]] between the Soviet Union and [[China]] escalated into a [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border conflict]] in 1969. The United States and the Soviet Union continued to compete for worldwide influence, but tensions had eased considerably since the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. In this shifting international context, Nixon and Kissinger sought to realign U.S. foreign policy and establish peaceful coexistence with both the Soviet Union and China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=760\u2013761, 765}} Nixon's goal of closer relations with China and the Soviet Union was closely linked to ending the Vietnam War,{{sfn|Gaddis|pp=294, 299}}{{sfn|Guan|pp=61, 69, 77\u201379}}{{sfn|Zhai|p=136}} since he hoped that rapprochement with the two leading Communist powers would pressure North Vietnam into accepting a favorable settlement.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nixon| first = Richard| date = 1985| title = No More Vietnams| pages = [https://archive.org/details/nomorevietnams00nixo/page/105 105\u2013106]| publisher = Arbor House Publishing Company| location = Westminster, Maryland| isbn = 978-0-87795-668-6| url = https://archive.org/details/nomorevietnams00nixo/page/105}}</ref>\n\n==== China ====\n{{Further|1972 Nixon visit to China}}\n[[File:Nixon shakes hands with Chou En-lai.jpg|thumb|President Nixon shakes hands with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] upon arriving in Beijing]]\n\nSince the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the United States had refused to formally recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the legitimate government of China, though the PRC controlled [[Mainland China]]. The U.S. had instead supported the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which controlled Taiwan.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}} By the time Nixon took office, many leading foreign policy figures in the United States had come to believe the U.S. should end its policy of isolating the PRC.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=118\u2013119}} The vast Chinese markets presented an economic opportunity for the increasingly-weak U.S. economy, and the Sino-Soviet split offered an opportunity to play the two Communist powers against each other. Chinese leaders, meanwhile, were receptive to closer relations with the U.S. for several reasons, including hostility to the Soviet Union, a desire for increased trade, and hopes of winning international recognition.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}}\n\nBoth sides faced domestic pressures against closer relations. A conservative faction of Republicans led by [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] strongly opposed a rapprochement with China, while [[Lin Biao]] led a similar faction in the PRC. For the first two years of his presidency, Nixon and China each made subtle moves designed to lower tensions, including the removal of travel restrictions. The expansion of the Vietnam War into Laos and Cambodia hindered, but did not derail, the move towards normalization of relations.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=776\u2013778}} Due to a misunderstanding at the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]], the Chinese [[table tennis]] team invited the [[ping-pong diplomacy|U.S. table tennis team to tour China]], creating an opening for further engagement between the U.S. and China.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=120\u2013121}} In the aftermath of the visit, Nixon lifted the trade embargo on China.

Through d\u00e9tente, he hoped to \"minimize confrontation in marginal areas and provide, at least, alternative possibilities in the major ones.\" [[West Germany]] had also pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union in a policy known as \"[[Ostpolitik]],\" and Nixon hoped to re-establish American dominance in [[NATO]] by taking the lead in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Nixon also believed that expanding trade with the Soviet Union would help the U.S. economy and could allow both countries to devote fewer resources to defense spending. For their part, the Soviets were motivated by a struggling economy and their ongoing split with China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=770\u2013773}}\n\nUpon taking office, Nixon took several steps to signal to the Soviets his desire for negotiation. In his first press conference, he noted that the United States would accept nuclear parity, rather than superiority, with the Soviet Union. Kissinger conducted extensive backchannel talks with Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] over arms control negotiations and potential Soviet assistance in negotiations with North Vietnam. Seeking a bargaining chip in negotiations, Nixon funded development of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]]s, which were not easily countered by existing [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems. Arms control negotiations would thus center over ABM systems, MIRVs, and the various components of each respective country's nuclear arsenal. After over a year of negotiations, both sides agreed to the outlines of two treaties; one treaty would focus on ABM systems, while the other would focus on limiting nuclear arsenals.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=773\u2013775}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0420\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043d \u0432 1972 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Nixon in [[Kiev]] in 1972]]\n\nIn May 1972, Nixon met with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other leading Soviet officials at the 1972 [[Moscow Summit (1972)|Moscow Summit]]. The two sides reached the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement]] (SALT I), which set upper limits on the number of offensive missiles and [[ballistic missile submarine]]s that each county could maintain. A separate agreement, the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], stipulated that each country could only field two anti-ballistic missile systems. The United States also agreed to the creation of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=794\u2013795}} An October 1972 trade agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union vastly increased trade between the two countries, though Congress did not approve of Nixon's proposal to extend [[most favoured nation]] status to the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nNixon would embark on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974, meeting with Brezhnev in [[Yalta]]. They discussed a proposed mutual defense pact and other issues, but there were no significant breakthroughs in the negotiations.{{sfn|Black|p=963}} During Nixon's final year in office, Congress undercut Nixon's d\u00e9tente policies by passing the [[Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=803\u2013804}} Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], an opponent of d\u00e9tente, introduced the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in response to a Soviet tax that curbed the flow of Jewish emigrants, many of whom sought to immigrate to Israel. Angered by the amendment, the Soviets canceled the 1972 trade agreement and reduced the number of Jews who were permitted to emigrate.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=115\u2013116}} Though d\u00e9tente was unpopular with many on the left due to humanitarian concerns, and with many on the right due to concerns about being overly accommodating to the Soviets, Nixon's policies helped significantly lower Cold War tensions even after he left office.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\n=== Latin America ===\n[[File:Gustavo Diaz Ordaz Richard Nixon San Diego.jpg|thumb|Nixon and Mexican president [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] riding a presidential motorcade in San Diego, California, September 1970]]\n\n==== Cuba ====\nNixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, [[Fidel Castro]]. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, [[Bebe Rebozo]], who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba in violation of the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the agreement. Despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process\u2014which began in secret, but quickly leaked\u2014had not been completed when the U.S. deduced that the Soviets were expanding their base at the Cuban port of [[Cienfuegos]] in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.{{sfn|Ambrose 1989|pp=379\u2013383}}\n\n==== Chile ====\n{{Further|United States intervention in Chile}}\n\nLike his predecessors, Nixon was determined to prevent the rise of another Soviet-aligned state in [[Latin America]], and his administration was greatly distressed by the victory of Marxist candidate [[Salvador Allende]] in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 Chilean presidential election]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=765\u2013766}} Nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende, intended to first prevent Allende from taking office, called [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]], and then when that failed, to provide a \"military solution\", called [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]].<ref name=\"Overthrow\">{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-8240-1|url=https://archive.org/details/overthrow00step}}</ref> As part of Track II, CIA operatives approached senior Chilean military leaders, using [[false flag]] operatives, and encouraged a coup d'\u00e9tat, providing both finances and weapons.<ref name=\"Legacy of Ashes\">{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|year=2007|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-38900-8|page=361}}</ref> These efforts failed, and Allende took office in November 1970.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=787\u2013788}}\n\nThe Nixon administration drastically cut economic aid to Chile and convinced [[World Bank]] leaders to block aid to Chile.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=788}} Extensive covert efforts continued as the U.S. funded [[black propaganda]], organized strikes against Allende, and provided funding for Allende opponents.

After the Soviet Union upped arms shipments to [[Egypt]] in mid-1970, Nixon moved closer to Israel, authorizing the shipment of [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] [[fighter aircraft]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=799\u2013801}} In October 1973, after Israel declined Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s offer of negotiations over the lands it had won control of in the Six-Day War, Egypt and [[Syria]] launched a surprise attack against Israel. After Egypt and Syria experienced early successes in what became known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], the United States began to supply massive amounts of military aid to Israel, as Nixon overrode Kissinger's early reluctance to provide strong support to Israel. After Israel turned the tide in the war and advanced into Egypt and Syria, Kissinger and Brezhnev organized a cease fire. Cutting out the Soviet Union from further involvement, Kissinger helped arrange agreements between Israel and the Arab states.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=804\u2013807}}\n\n[[File:Nixons with Golda Meir cropped.jpg|thumb|Richard and [[Pat Nixon]] with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], 1973]]\n\nThough it had been established in 1960, [[OPEC]] did not gain effective control over oil prices until 1970, when [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] forced oil companies in Libya to agree to a price increase; other countries followed suit. U.S. leaders did not attempt to block these price increases, as they believed that higher prices would help increase domestic production of oil. This increased production failed to materialize, and by 1973 the U.S. consumed over one and a half times the oil that it produced domestically.{{Sfn|Small|1999|p=138}} In 1973, in response to the U.S. support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC countries cut oil production, raised prices, and initiated an [[embargo]] targeted against the United States and other countries that had supported Israel.{{sfn|Black|pp=923\u2013928}} The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, but was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as the Yom Kippur War peace took hold.{{sfn|Ambrose 1991|p=311}}\n\n=== Europe===\n\nJust weeks after his 1969 inauguration, Nixon made an eight-day trip to Europe.

He also made groundbreaking trips to several Eastern European nations, including [[Romania]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Poland]]. However, the NATO allies of the United States generally did not play a large role in Nixon's foreign policy, as he focused on the Vietnam War and d\u00e9tente.

Moynihan's proposed plan centered on replacing welfare programs with a [[negative income tax]], which would provide a [[guaranteed minimum income]] to all Americans. Nixon became closely involved in the proposal and, despite opposition from Arthur Burns and other conservatives, adopted Moynihan's plan as the central legislative proposal of his first year in office. In an August 1969 televised address, Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Plan (FAP), which would establish a national income floor of $1600 per year for a family of four.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nPublic response to the FAP was highly favorable, but it faced strong opposition in Congress, partly due to the lack of congressional involvement in the drafting of the proposal.

He was succeeded by [[Gerald Ford]], whom he had appointed [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign. Nixon took office after the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], in which he defeated incumbent Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Although Nixon had built his reputation as a  very active [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican campaigner]], he downplayed partisanship in his 1972 landslide reelection.\n\nNixon's primary focus while in office was on foreign affairs. He focused on [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], easing [[Cold War]] tensions with both countries. As part of this policy, Nixon signed the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] and [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] I, two landmark arms control treaties with the [[Soviet Union]]. Nixon promulgated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for indirect assistance by the United States rather than direct U.S. commitments as seen in the ongoing [[Vietnam War]]. After extensive negotiations with [[North Vietnam]], Nixon withdrew the last U.S. soldiers from [[South Vietnam]] in 1973, ending the military draft that same year. To prevent the possibility of further U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Congress passed the [[War Powers Resolution]] over Nixon's veto.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Nixon advocated a policy of \"[[New Federalism]],\" in which federal powers and responsibilities would be shifted to the [[U.S. state|states]]. However, he faced a Democratic Congress that did not share his goals and, in some cases, enacted legislation over his veto. Nixon's proposed reform of federal welfare programs did not pass Congress, but Congress did adopt one aspect of his proposal in the form of [[Supplemental Security Income]], which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled. The Nixon administration adopted a \"low profile\" on school desegregation, but the administration enforced court desegregation orders and implemented the first [[affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] plan in the United States. Nixon also presided over the creation of [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the passage of major environmental laws like the [[Clean Water Act]]. Economically, the Nixon years saw the start of a period of \"[[stagflation]]\" that would continue into the 1970s.\n\nNixon was far ahead in the polls in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], but during the campaign, Nixon operatives conducted several illegal operations designed to undermine the opposition. They were exposed when the break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] Headquarters, ended in the arrest of five burglars and gave rise to a congressional investigation. Nixon denied any involvement in the break in, but, after a tape emerged revealing that Nixon had known about the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries shortly after they occurred, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] initiated impeachment proceedings. Facing removal by Congress, Nixon resigned from office. Though some scholars believe that Nixon \"has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues\",{{sfn|Aitken|p=577}} Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|surveys of historians and political scientists]].<ref name=\"brottinghaus\"/><ref name=\"Siena\"/><ref name=\"cspanrankings\"/>\n\n== Election of 1968 ==\n{{further|Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|United States presidential election, 1968}}\n\n===Republican nomination===\n[[Richard Nixon]] had served as vice president from 1953 to 1961, and had been defeated in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] by [[John F.

The United States and Soviet Union had been the clear leaders of their respective blocs of allies during the 1950s, but the world became increasingly multipolar during the 1960s. U.S. allies in Western Europe and East Asia had recovered economically, and while they remained allied with United States, they set their own foreign policies. The fracture in the so-called \"[[Second World]]\" of Communist states was more serious, as the [[Sino-Soviet split|split]] between the Soviet Union and [[China]] escalated into a [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border conflict]] in 1969. The United States and the Soviet Union continued to compete for worldwide influence, but tensions had eased considerably since the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. In this shifting international context, Nixon and Kissinger sought to realign U.S. foreign policy and establish peaceful coexistence with both the Soviet Union and China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=760\u2013761, 765}} Nixon's goal of closer relations with China and the Soviet Union was closely linked to ending the Vietnam War,{{sfn|Gaddis|pp=294, 299}}{{sfn|Guan|pp=61, 69, 77\u201379}}{{sfn|Zhai|p=136}} since he hoped that rapprochement with the two leading Communist powers would pressure North Vietnam into accepting a favorable settlement.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nixon| first = Richard| date = 1985| title = No More Vietnams| pages = [https://archive.org/details/nomorevietnams00nixo/page/105 105\u2013106]| publisher = Arbor House Publishing Company| location = Westminster, Maryland| isbn = 978-0-87795-668-6| url = https://archive.org/details/nomorevietnams00nixo/page/105}}</ref>\n\n==== China ====\n{{Further|1972 Nixon visit to China}}\n[[File:Nixon shakes hands with Chou En-lai.jpg|thumb|President Nixon shakes hands with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] upon arriving in Beijing]]\n\nSince the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the United States had refused to formally recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the legitimate government of China, though the PRC controlled [[Mainland China]]. The U.S. had instead supported the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which controlled Taiwan.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}} By the time Nixon took office, many leading foreign policy figures in the United States had come to believe the U.S. should end its policy of isolating the PRC.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=118\u2013119}} The vast Chinese markets presented an economic opportunity for the increasingly-weak U.S. economy, and the Sino-Soviet split offered an opportunity to play the two Communist powers against each other. Chinese leaders, meanwhile, were receptive to closer relations with the U.S. for several reasons, including hostility to the Soviet Union, a desire for increased trade, and hopes of winning international recognition.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=775\u2013776}}\n\nBoth sides faced domestic pressures against closer relations. A conservative faction of Republicans led by [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] strongly opposed a rapprochement with China, while [[Lin Biao]] led a similar faction in the PRC. For the first two years of his presidency, Nixon and China each made subtle moves designed to lower tensions, including the removal of travel restrictions. The expansion of the Vietnam War into Laos and Cambodia hindered, but did not derail, the move towards normalization of relations.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=776\u2013778}} Due to a misunderstanding at the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]], the Chinese [[table tennis]] team invited the [[ping-pong diplomacy|U.S. table tennis team to tour China]], creating an opening for further engagement between the U.S. and China.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=120\u2013121}} In the aftermath of the visit, Nixon lifted the trade embargo on China. At a July 1971 meeting with Chinese [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]], Kissinger promised not to support independence for Taiwan, while Zhou invited Nixon to China for further talks.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=776\u2013778}} After the meeting, China and the United States astounded the world by simultaneously announcing that Nixon would visit China in February 1972.{{sfn|Ambrose 1989|p=453}} In the aftermath of the announcement, the [[United Nations]] passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]], which recognized the PRC as the legitimate government of China and expelled representatives from the ROC.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=779}}\n\n[[File:President Nixon meets with China's Communist Party Leader, Mao Tse- Tung, 02-29-1972 - NARA - 194759.tif|thumb|Chinese Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] meets with Nixon, 1972]]\n\nIn February 1972, Nixon traveled to China; Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40&nbsp;hours in preparation.{{sfn|Black|p=778}} Upon touching down in the Chinese capital of [[Beijing]], Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva.<ref name=ChinaPBS>{{cite serial| title=The Nixon Visit| series=[[American Experience]]| network=[[PBS]]| date=| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/china/sfeature/nixon.html| accessdate = July 17, 2011}}</ref> The visit was carefully choreographed by both governments, and major events were broadcast live during [[prime time]] to reach the widest possible television audience in the U.S.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=791\u2013792}} When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders such as the [[Forbidden City]], [[Ming Tombs]], and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], giving many Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life.<ref name=ChinaPBS/>\n\nNixon and Kissinger discussed a range of issues with Zhou and [[Mao Zedong]], the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]].{{sfn|Black|pp=780\u2013782}} China provided assurances that it would not intervene in the Vietnam War, while the United States promised to prevent Japan from acquiring nuclear weapons. Nixon recognized [[Political status of Taiwan|Taiwan as part of China]], while the Chinese agreed to pursue a peaceful settlement in the dispute with the ROC. The United States and China increased trade relations and established unofficial embassies in each other's respective capitals. Though some conservatives criticized his visit, Nixon's opening of relations with China was widely popular in the United States.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=791\u2013793}} The visit also aided Nixon's negotiations with the Soviet Union, which feared the possibility of a Sino-American alliance.{{sfn|Dallek|p=300}}\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\n\n[[File:Leonid Brezhnev and Richard Nixon talks in 1973.png|thumb|Nixon meets with Brezhnev during the Soviet leader's trip to the U.S. in 1973.]]\n\nNixon made [[d\u00e9tente]], the easing of tensions with the Soviet Union, one of his top priorities. Through d\u00e9tente, he hoped to \"minimize confrontation in marginal areas and provide, at least, alternative possibilities in the major ones.\" [[West Germany]] had also pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union in a policy known as \"[[Ostpolitik]],\" and Nixon hoped to re-establish American dominance in [[NATO]] by taking the lead in negotiations with the Soviet Union. Nixon also believed that expanding trade with the Soviet Union would help the U.S. economy and could allow both countries to devote fewer resources to defense spending. For their part, the Soviets were motivated by a struggling economy and their ongoing split with China.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=770\u2013773}}\n\nUpon taking office, Nixon took several steps to signal to the Soviets his desire for negotiation. In his first press conference, he noted that the United States would accept nuclear parity, rather than superiority, with the Soviet Union. Kissinger conducted extensive backchannel talks with Soviet Ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] over arms control negotiations and potential Soviet assistance in negotiations with North Vietnam. Seeking a bargaining chip in negotiations, Nixon funded development of [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]]s, which were not easily countered by existing [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems. Arms control negotiations would thus center over ABM systems, MIRVs, and the various components of each respective country's nuclear arsenal. After over a year of negotiations, both sides agreed to the outlines of two treaties; one treaty would focus on ABM systems, while the other would focus on limiting nuclear arsenals.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=773\u2013775}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0420\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043d \u0432 1972 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Nixon in [[Kiev]] in 1972]]\n\nIn May 1972, Nixon met with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and other leading Soviet officials at the 1972 [[Moscow Summit (1972)|Moscow Summit]]. The two sides reached the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement]] (SALT I), which set upper limits on the number of offensive missiles and [[ballistic missile submarine]]s that each county could maintain. A separate agreement, the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], stipulated that each country could only field two anti-ballistic missile systems. The United States also agreed to the creation of the [[Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=794\u2013795}} An October 1972 trade agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union vastly increased trade between the two countries, though Congress did not approve of Nixon's proposal to extend [[most favoured nation]] status to the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nNixon would embark on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974, meeting with Brezhnev in [[Yalta]]. They discussed a proposed mutual defense pact and other issues, but there were no significant breakthroughs in the negotiations.{{sfn|Black|p=963}} During Nixon's final year in office, Congress undercut Nixon's d\u00e9tente policies by passing the [[Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=803\u2013804}} Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], an opponent of d\u00e9tente, introduced the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in response to a Soviet tax that curbed the flow of Jewish emigrants, many of whom sought to immigrate to Israel. Angered by the amendment, the Soviets canceled the 1972 trade agreement and reduced the number of Jews who were permitted to emigrate.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=115\u2013116}} Though d\u00e9tente was unpopular with many on the left due to humanitarian concerns, and with many on the right due to concerns about being overly accommodating to the Soviets, Nixon's policies helped significantly lower Cold War tensions even after he left office.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\n=== Latin America ===\n[[File:Gustavo Diaz Ordaz Richard Nixon San Diego.jpg|thumb|Nixon and Mexican president [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] riding a presidential motorcade in San Diego, California, September 1970]]\n\n==== Cuba ====\nNixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, [[Fidel Castro]]. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, [[Bebe Rebozo]], who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba in violation of the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the agreement. Despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process\u2014which began in secret, but quickly leaked\u2014had not been completed when the U.S. deduced that the Soviets were expanding their base at the Cuban port of [[Cienfuegos]] in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.{{sfn|Ambrose 1989|pp=379\u2013383}}\n\n==== Chile ====\n{{Further|United States intervention in Chile}}\n\nLike his predecessors, Nixon was determined to prevent the rise of another Soviet-aligned state in [[Latin America]], and his administration was greatly distressed by the victory of Marxist candidate [[Salvador Allende]] in the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 Chilean presidential election]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=765\u2013766}} Nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende, intended to first prevent Allende from taking office, called [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]], and then when that failed, to provide a \"military solution\", called [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]].<ref name=\"Overthrow\">{{cite book|last=Kinzer|first=Stephen|title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Times Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-8240-1|url=https://archive.org/details/overthrow00step}}</ref> As part of Track II, CIA operatives approached senior Chilean military leaders, using [[false flag]] operatives, and encouraged a coup d'\u00e9tat, providing both finances and weapons.<ref name=\"Legacy of Ashes\">{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|title=Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA|year=2007|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-38900-8|page=361}}</ref> These efforts failed, and Allende took office in November 1970.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=787\u2013788}}\n\nThe Nixon administration drastically cut economic aid to Chile and convinced [[World Bank]] leaders to block aid to Chile.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|p=788}} Extensive covert efforts continued as the U.S. funded [[black propaganda]], organized strikes against Allende, and provided funding for Allende opponents.

After the Soviet Union upped arms shipments to [[Egypt]] in mid-1970, Nixon moved closer to Israel, authorizing the shipment of [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] [[fighter aircraft]].{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=799\u2013801}} In October 1973, after Israel declined Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s offer of negotiations over the lands it had won control of in the Six-Day War, Egypt and [[Syria]] launched a surprise attack against Israel. After Egypt and Syria experienced early successes in what became known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], the United States began to supply massive amounts of military aid to Israel, as Nixon overrode Kissinger's early reluctance to provide strong support to Israel. After Israel turned the tide in the war and advanced into Egypt and Syria, Kissinger and Brezhnev organized a cease fire. Cutting out the Soviet Union from further involvement, Kissinger helped arrange agreements between Israel and the Arab states.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=804\u2013807}}\n\n[[File:Nixons with Golda Meir cropped.jpg|thumb|Richard and [[Pat Nixon]] with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], 1973]]\n\nThough it had been established in 1960, [[OPEC]] did not gain effective control over oil prices until 1970, when [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] forced oil companies in Libya to agree to a price increase; other countries followed suit. U.S. leaders did not attempt to block these price increases, as they believed that higher prices would help increase domestic production of oil. This increased production failed to materialize, and by 1973 the U.S. consumed over one and a half times the oil that it produced domestically.{{Sfn|Small|1999|p=138}} In 1973, in response to the U.S. support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC countries cut oil production, raised prices, and initiated an [[embargo]] targeted against the United States and other countries that had supported Israel.{{sfn|Black|pp=923\u2013928}} The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, but was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as the Yom Kippur War peace took hold.{{sfn|Ambrose 1991|p=311}}\n\n=== Europe===\n\nJust weeks after his 1969 inauguration, Nixon made an eight-day trip to Europe.

In February 1970, as a part of the effort to keep federal spending down, Nixon delayed pay raises to federal employees by six months. When the nation's [[postal worker]]s went on strike, he used the army to keep the postal system going.

However, many Americans, particularly conservatives, believed that [[Welfare trap|welfare programs discouraged individuals from finding employment]]; conservatives also derided \"[[welfare queen]]s\" who they alleged collected excessive amounts of welfare benefits.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=185\u2013186}} On taking office, Nixon established the Council of Urban Affairs, under the leadership of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, to develop a welfare reform proposal. Moynihan's proposed plan centered on replacing welfare programs with a [[negative income tax]], which would provide a [[guaranteed minimum income]] to all Americans. Nixon became closely involved in the proposal and, despite opposition from Arthur Burns and other conservatives, adopted Moynihan's plan as the central legislative proposal of his first year in office. In an August 1969 televised address, Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Plan (FAP), which would establish a national income floor of $1600 per year for a family of four.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nPublic response to the FAP was highly favorable, but it faced strong opposition in Congress, partly due to the lack of congressional involvement in the drafting of the proposal. Many conservatives opposed the establishment of the national income floor, while many liberals believed that the floor was too low. Though the FAP passed the House, the bill died in the Senate Finance Committee in May 1970.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=188\u2013189}} Though Nixon's overall proposal failed, Congress did adopt one aspect of the FAP, as it voted to establish the [[Supplemental Security Income]] program, which provides aid to low-income individuals who are aged or disabled.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nDetermined to dismantle much of Johnson's [[Great Society]] and its accompanying federal bureaucracy, Nixon defunded or abolished several programs, including the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]], the [[Job Corps]], and the [[Model Cities Program]].{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=190\u2013191}} Nixon advocated a \"[[New Federalism]]\", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, but Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted only a few of them.{{sfn|Aitken|p=395}} During Nixon's tenure, spending on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Medicaid]] all increased dramatically.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=189\u2013190}} Total spending on social insurance programs grew from $27.3 billion in 1969 to $67.4 billion in 1975, while the poverty rate dropped from 12.8 percent in 1968 to 11.1 percent in 1973.{{sfn|Patterson|p=721}}\n\n====Healthcare====\nIn August 1970, Democratic Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] introduced legislation to establish a [[Single-payer healthcare|single-payer]] [[universal health care]] system financed by taxes and with no [[cost sharing]].<ref name=\"NHI: CQ Almanac 1970\">{{cite book| year=1971| chapter=National health insurance| title=Congressional Quarterly Almanac 91st Congress 2nd Session{{snd}}1970| volume=26| location=Washington, D.C.| publisher=Congressional Quarterly| pages=603\u2013605| issn=0095-6007| oclc=1564784}}</ref> In February 1971, Nixon proposed a more limited package of health care reform, consisting of an [[Health insurance mandate#Employer mandates|employee mandate]] to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, the federalization of [[Medicaid]] for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs).<ref name=\"NHI: CQ Almanac 1971\">{{cite book| year=1972| chapter=Health insurance: hearings on new proposals| title=Congressional Quarterly Almanac 92nd Congress 1st Session{{snd}}1971| volume=27| location=Washington, D.C.| publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=541\u2013544|issn=0095-6007|oclc=1564784}}</ref> This market-based system would, Nixon argued, \"build on the strengths of the private system.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=Recalling the Nixon-Kennedy health plan| last=Stockman| first=Farah| date=June 23, 2012| url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2012/06/22/stockman/bvg57mguQxOVpZMmB1Mg2N/story.html| work=Boston Globe| location=Boston, Massachusetts| accessdate=June 26, 2017}}</ref> Both the House and Senate held hearings on national health insurance in 1971, but no legislation emerged from either committee.<ref name=elusivequest>{{cite book| title=Universal Coverage: The Elusive Quest for National Health Insurance| pages=[https://archive.org/details/universalcoverag0000maye/page/88 88]\u201397| last=Mayes| first=Rick| publisher=University of Michigan Press| location=Ann Arbor, Michigan| date=2004| isbn=978-0-472-11457-3| url=https://archive.org/details/universalcoverag0000maye| url-access=registration}}</ref> In October 1972, Nixon signed the Social Security Amendments of 1972, extending Medicare to those under 65 who had been severely disabled for over two years or had [[End Stage Renal Disease Program|end stage renal disease]] and gradually raising the Medicare Part A payroll tax.<ref name=\"SS: CQ Almanac 1972\">{{cite book| year=1973| chapter=Welfare reform deleted from Social Security bill| title=Congressional Quarterly Almanac 92nd Congress 2nd Session{{snd}}1972| volume=28| location=Washington, D.C.| publisher=Congressional Quarterly|pages=899\u2013914| issn=0095-6007| oclc=1564784}}</ref> In December 1973, he signed the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]], establishing a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of HMOs.<ref name=\"HMO: CQ Almanac 1973\">{{cite book| year=1974| chapter=Limited experimental health bill enacted| title=Congressional Quarterly Almanac 93rd Congress 1st Session{{snd}}1973| volume=29| location=Washington, D.C.| publisher=Congressional Quarterly| pages=499\u2013508| issn=0095-6007| oclc=1564784}}</ref>\n\nThere was a renewed push for health insurance reform in 1974.

Ashmore]].\n\nBorn on a farm near [[Greenville, South Carolina]], Ashmore attended the public schools of Greenville. He graduated from [[Furman University]] Law School, Greenville, South Carolina, in 1927. While a student he engaged in agricultural work, retail sales, and as a substitute rural mail carrier. He was admitted to the bar in January 1928 and engaged in the practice of law in Greenville, South Carolina. He served as solicitor of Greenville County Court 1930&ndash;1934, and then as solicitor of the thirteenth judicial circuit of South Carolina 1936&ndash;1953. During [[World War II]], while on official leave from duties as solicitor, Ashmore volunteered for service in the [[United States Army]] in December 1942, serving in the United States and overseas until discharged from active duty in May 1946, as a lieutenant colonel in the [[United States Army Reserve]]. He was promoted to colonel in 1955.\n\nAshmore was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[83rd United States Congress|Eighty-third Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Joseph R. Bryson]]. He was reelected to the [[84th United States Congress|Eighty-fourth]] and to the six succeeding Congresses (June 2, 1953 &ndash; January 3, 1969), during which time he was a signatory to the 1956 [[Southern Manifesto]] that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1968 to the [[Ninety-first Congress]]. He resumed the practice of law.\n\nHe served as member of the board of South Carolina Appalachian Regional Planning and Development Commission (later South Carolina Appalachian Council of Governments) from 1970 to 1989, and chairman from 1970 to 1972.

Ashmore]].\n\nBorn on a farm near [[Greenville, South Carolina]], Ashmore attended the public schools of Greenville. He graduated from [[Furman University]] Law School, Greenville, South Carolina, in 1927. While a student he engaged in agricultural work, retail sales, and as a substitute rural mail carrier. He was admitted to the bar in January 1928 and engaged in the practice of law in Greenville, South Carolina. He served as solicitor of Greenville County Court 1930&ndash;1934, and then as solicitor of the thirteenth judicial circuit of South Carolina 1936&ndash;1953. During [[World War II]], while on official leave from duties as solicitor, Ashmore volunteered for service in the [[United States Army]] in December 1942, serving in the United States and overseas until discharged from active duty in May 1946, as a lieutenant colonel in the [[United States Army Reserve]]. He was promoted to colonel in 1955.\n\nAshmore was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[83rd United States Congress|Eighty-third Congress]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Joseph R. Bryson]]. He was reelected to the [[84th United States Congress|Eighty-fourth]] and to the six succeeding Congresses (June 2, 1953 &ndash; January 3, 1969), during which time he was a signatory to the 1956 [[Southern Manifesto]] that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1968 to the [[Ninety-first Congress]]. He resumed the practice of law.\n\nHe served as member of the board of South Carolina Appalachian Regional Planning and Development Commission (later South Carolina Appalachian Council of Governments) from 1970 to 1989, and chairman from 1970 to 1972. Ashmore was also elected to the [[Common Cause]] National Governing Board in 1973. He was a resident of Greenville, South Carolina, until his death there on October 5, 1989. He was interred in White Oak Baptist Church Cemetery, Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n==Sources==\n{{CongBio|A000223}}\n*{{Find a Grave|8064471}}\n[https://archives.library.sc.edu/repositories/6/resources/170 Robert T.

For [[plants]], this is done by in vitro storage, freezing cuttings from the plant, or stocking the [[seed]]s (e.g. in a [[seedbank]]). For animals, this is done by the freezing of [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]]s in [[Frozen zoo|zoological freezer]]s until further need. With corals, fragments are taken and stored in water tanks under controlled conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdnn.info/eco/e031117/e031117.html|title=\u9752\u6c41\u3068\u53e3\u81ed\u3068\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3068\u904b\u52d5|website=www.cdnn.info|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref> Genetic material in a 'gene bank' is preserved in a variety of ways, such as freezing at -196\u00b0 Celsius in liquid nitrogen, being placed in artificial ecosystems, and  put in controlled nutrient mediums.\n\nAccession is the common term given to an individual sample in a gene bank, such as a distinct species or variety. \n\nIn plants, it is possible to unfreeze the material and propagate it. However, in animals, a living female is required for [[artificial insemination]]. While it is often difficult to use frozen animal sperm and eggs, there are many examples of it being done successfully.\n\nIn an effort to conserve [[agricultural biodiversity]], gene banks are used to store and conserve the [[plant genetic resources]] of major crop plants and their [[crop wild relatives]]. There are many gene banks all over the world, with the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] being considered the most famous one.<ref>On practical and theoretical differences between a storage and a gene bank, see [[Nicole C.
