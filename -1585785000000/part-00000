It soon met resistance from the highest office holders of Japan.  Emperor Ogimachi issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568, but to little effect. Beginning in 1587 with imperial regent [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s ban on [[Jesuit]] missionaries, Christianity was repressed as a threat to national unity.<ref name=\"Jansen, page 67\">[[#Jansen|Jansen]], p. 67</ref> After the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] banned Christianity in 1620 it ceased to exist publicly.

Of the 95 Jesuits who worked in Japan up to 1600, 57 were Portuguese, 20 were Spaniards and 18 Italian.<ref>Ruiz-de-Medina, Father Juan G., Cultural Interactions in the Orient 30 years before Matteo Ricci.

Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization. Although at the time of the demarcation, neither nation had any direct contact with Japan, that nation fell into the sphere of the Portuguese.\n\nThe countries disputed the attribution of Japan. Since neither could colonize it, the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan meant the exclusive right to trade with Japan. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits under [[Alessandro Valignano]] took the lead in proselytizing in Japan over the objection of the Spaniards. The fait accompli was approved in [[Pope Gregory XIII]]'s [[papal bull]] of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese diocese of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]. In 1588, the {{anchor|Diocese of Funai}}<!-- [[Diocese of Funai]] redirects here-->diocese of Funai (the [[Funai Domain]], centred on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]) was founded under Portuguese protection.\n\nIn rivalry with the Jesuits, Spanish-sponsored [[mendicant orders]] entered into Japan via [[Manila]]. While criticizing Jesuit activities, they actively lobbied the Pope. Their campaigns resulted in [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s decree of 1600, which allowed Spanish [[friars]] to enter Japan via [[Portuguese India]], and [[Pope Paul V]]'s decree of 1608, which abolished the restrictions on the route. The Portuguese accused Spanish Jesuits of working for their homeland instead of their patron. The power struggle between Jesuits and mendicant orders caused a schism within the diocese of Funai. Furthermore, mendicant orders tried in vain to establish a diocese on the [[Tohoku region]] that was to be independent from the Portuguese one.\n\nReligious rivalries between Catholics and Protestants reached Japan with the arrival of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[England|English]] traders in the early 17th century.  Although England withdrew from the operations in ten years under [[James I of England|James I]] due to lack of profitability, the Netherlands continued to trade with Japan and became the only European country that maintained trade relations with Japan until the 19th century. As trade competitors, the Protestant countries engaged in a negative campaign against Catholicism, and it subsequently affected [[shogunate]] policies toward the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal.\n\n==Francis Xavier==\n[[Image:Japanese Christian bell.jpg|upright|thumb|Japanese-Portuguese Bell Inscribed 1570, Nantoy\u014ds\u014d Collection, Japan]]\n\n[[Francis Xavier]] was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  In [[Portuguese Malacca]] in December 1547, Xavier met a Japanese man from [[Kagoshima]] named [[Anjir\u014d]]. Anjir\u014d had heard from Xavier in 1545 and had travelled from Kagoshima to Malacca with the purpose of meeting with him. Having been charged with murder, Anjir\u014d had fled Japan. He told Xavier extensively about his former life and the customs and culture of his beloved homeland. Anjir\u014d helped Xavier as a mediator and translator for the mission to Japan that now seemed much more possible. \"I asked [Anjir\u014d] whether the Japanese would become Christians if I went with him to this country, and he replied that they would not do so immediately, but would first ask me many questions and see what I knew. Above all, they would want to see whether my life corresponded with my teaching.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nXavier returned to India in January 1548. The next 15 months were occupied with various journeys and administrative measures in India. Then, due to displeasure at what he considered un-Christian life and manners on the part of the Portuguese which impeded missionary work, he left India and traveled to East Asia. He left Goa on 15 April 1549, stopped at Malacca and visited [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. He was accompanied by Anjir\u014d, two other Japanese men, the father [[Cosme de Torr\u00e8s]] and Brother Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. He had taken with him presents for the \"[[Japanese Emperor|King of Japan]]\" since he was intending to introduce himself as the [[Apostolic Nuncio]].\n\nXavier reached Japan on 27 July 1549, with Anjir\u014d and three other Jesuits, but it was not until 15 August that he went ashore at  [[Kagoshima]], the principal port of the province of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] on the island of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner and was hosted by Anjir\u014d's family until October 1550. From October to December 1550, he resided in [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]]. Shortly before Christmas, he left for [[Kyoto]] but failed to meet with the Emperor. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where he was permitted to preach by the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of the province. However, lacking fluency in the Japanese language, he had to limit himself to reading aloud a Japanese translation of a [[catechism]].\n\nThe Japanese people were not easily converted; many of the people were already Buddhist or Shinto. Francis tried to combat the disposition of some of the Japanese that a God who had created everything, including evil, could not be good. The concept of Hell was also a struggle; the Japanese were bothered by the idea of their ancestors living in Hell. Despite Francis' different religion, he felt that they were good people, much like Europeans, and could be converted.<ref>Ellis, Robert Richmond. \u201cThe Best Thus Far Discovered\u201d: The Japanese in the Letters of St. Francisco Xavier.

These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language. Artwork continued to play a role in Francis\u2019 teachings in Asia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nXavier was welcomed by the [[Shingon]] monks since he used the word ''[[Vairocana|Dainichi]]'' for the Christian God; attempting to adapt the concept to local traditions. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to ''Deusu'' from the Latin and Portuguese ''Deus''. The monks later realized that Xavier was preaching a rival religion and grew more aggressive towards his attempts at conversion.\n\nWhen Xavier arrived in Japan, the country was embroiled in a nationwide civil war. Neither the emperor nor the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Ashikaga]] ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' could exercise power over the nation. At first, Xavier planned to gain permission for building a mission from the emperor but was disappointed with the devastation of the imperial residence. The Jesuits approached ''daimy\u014d'' in southwestern Japan and succeeded in converting some of them. One reason for their conversion may have been the Portuguese trade in which the Jesuits acted as brokers. The Jesuits recognized this and approached local rulers with offers of trade and exotic gifts.\n\nThe Jesuits believed that it was most effective to seek to influence people in power and to pass the religion downward to the commoners. At the least, they needed to gain permission from local rulers to propagate Catholicism within their domains. Indeed, as [[feudal]] lords converted to Catholicism, the number of believers within their territories also drastically increased.{{Citation needed|reason=this is a very interesting topic and we could use some sources about this correlation|date=July 2010}} After the [[edict]] banning Christianity, there were communities that kept practicing Catholicism without any contact with the Church until missionaries were able to return much later.\n\nWhen Xavier disembarked in Kagoshima, the principal chiefs of the two branches of the Shimazu family, Sanehisa and Katsuhisa, were warring for the sovereignty of their lands. Katsuhisa adopted Takahisa Shimazu, who in 1542 was accepted as head of the clan, having previously received the Portuguese merchants on Tanegashima Island and learned about the use of firearms. Later, he met Xavier himself at the castle of Uchiujijo and permitted the conversion of his vassals.\n\nHaving a religious background, Takahisa showed himself to be benevolent and already allowed freedom of worship, but did not help the missionaries or favor their church. Failing to find a way to the centre of affairs, the court of the Emperor, Xavier soon tired and left to Yamaguchi, thus beginning the Yamaguchi period.<ref>Lopez-Gay, St Francis Xavier and the Shimazu Family, ''Bulletin of Portuguese/Japanese Studies'', Uni. Nova de Lisboa, Portugal 2003</ref> Xavier stayed in Yamaguchi for two months on his way to an abortive audience with the Emperor in Kyoto. Yamaguchi was a prosperous and refined city, and its leaders, the Ouchi family, were aware that Xavier's journey to Japan had begun after the completion of his mission in India.\n\nThey took Catholicism for some sort of new sect of Buddhism, and were curious to know of the priest's doctrine. Tolerant but shrewd, their eyes less on baptism than the Portuguese cargoes from Macau, they granted the Jesuit permission to preach. The uncompromising Xavier took to the streets of the city denouncing, among other things, infanticide, idolatry, and homosexuality (the last being widely accepted at the time). Misunderstandings were inevitable.\n\nThe Jesuits attempted to expand their activity to [[Kyoto]] and the surrounding regions. In 1559, Gaspar Vilela obtained permission from [[Ashikaga Yoshiteru]] to teach Christianity. This license was the same as those given to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temples]], so special treatment cannot be confirmed regarding the Jesuits. On the other hand, [[Emperor \u014cgimachi]] issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568. The orders of the Emperor and the ''sh\u014dgun'' made little difference.\n\nChristians refer positively to [[Oda Nobunaga]], who died in the middle of the unification of Japan. He favored the Jesuit missionary [[Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is]] and generally tolerated Christianity. But overall, he undertook no remarkable policies toward Catholicism. Actually, Catholic power in his domain was trivial because he did not conquer western Japan, where the Jesuits were based.\n\nWith the passage of time, Xavier's sojourn in Japan could be considered somewhat fruitful as attested by congregations established in [[Hirado]], Yamaguchi and [[Bungo Province|Bungo]]. Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India.\n\nFor 45 years, the Jesuits were the only Christian missionaries in Asia, and then the Franciscans began proselytizing as well.\n\n==Propagation strategy==\nChristian books were published in Japanese from the 1590s on, some with more than one thousand copies and from 1601 a printing press was established under the supervision of Soin Goto Thomas, a citizen of Nagasaki with thirty Japanese working full-time at the press. Liturgical calendars were also printed after 1592 until at least 1634. Christian solidarity made also possible missionary mail delivery throughout the country until the end of the 1620s.\n\n==Early expansion==\n[[Image:JapaneseVotiveAltar.JPG|thumb|A Japanese votive altar, [[Nanban art|Nanban]] style. End of the 16th century. [[Guimet Museum]].]]\n[[Image:CelebratingAChristianMassInJapan.jpg|thumb|Celebrating a Christian mass in Japan]]\n\nBy 1579, at the height of missionary activity, there were about 130,000 converts.<ref name=\"Early Modern Japan\">{{cite journal\n | last = L. Walker\n | first = Brett\n |date=Fall 2002\n | title = Foreign Affairs and Frontiers in Early Modern Japan: a Historio-graphical Essay\n| journal = Early Modern Japan: an Interdisciplinary Journal\n | volume = 10\n | issue = 2\n | pages = 44\u201362 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 16th century, the Japanese mission had become the largest overseas Christian community that was not under the rule of a European power. Its uniqueness was emphasized by [[Alessandro Valignano]] since 1582, who promoted a deeper accommodation of Japanese culture. Japan was then the sole overseas country in which all members of those confraternities were locals, as was the case with Christian missions in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, or India, in spite of the presence of a colonial elite.\n\nMost Japanese Christians lived in Kyushu, but Christianization was now a regional phenomenon and had a national impact. By the end of the 16th century it was possible to find baptized people in virtually every province of Japan, many of them organized in communities. On the eve of the [[Battle of Sekigahara|Sekigahara]] battle, fifteen ''daimy\u014ds'' were baptized, and their domains stretched from Hyuga in Southeast Kyushu to Dewa in North Honsh\u016b (see Costa 2003). Hundreds of churches had been built throughout Japan.\n\nAccepted on a national scale, Christianity was also successful among different social groups from the poor to the rich, peasants, traders, sailors, warriors, or courtesans. Most of the daily activities of the Church were performed by Japanese from the beginning, giving the Japanese Church a native face, and this was one of the reasons for its success. By 1590, there were seventy native brothers in Japan, fully one half of Jesuits in Japan and fifteen percent of all Jesuits who were working in Asia.\n\nThe [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|1592 War between Japan and Korea]] also provided Westerners with a rare opportunity to visit Korea. Under orders of Gomaz, the Jesuit [[Gregorious de Cespedes]] arrived in Korea with a Japanese monk for the purposes of ministering to the Japanese troops. He stayed there for approximately 18 months, until April or May 1595, thus being on record as the first European missionary to visit the Korean peninsula but was unable to make any inroads. The 'Annual Letters of Japan' made a substantial contribution to the introduction of Korea to Europe, Francis Xavier having crossed paths with Korean envoys dispatched to Japan during 1550 and 1551.\n\nThe Japanese missions were economically self-sufficient. Nagasaki's miseric\u00f3rdias became rich and powerful institutions which every year received large donations. The brotherhood grew in numbers to over 100 by 1585 and 150 in 1609. Controlled by the elite of Nagasaki, and not by Portuguese, it had two hospitals (one for lepers) and a large church. By 1606, there already existed a feminine religious order called ''Miyako no Bikuni'' (Nuns of Kyoto) which accepted Korean converts such as Marina Pak, baptized in Nagasaki.<ref>Oliveira e Costa, Jo\u00e3o Paulo</ref> Nagasaki was called \u201cthe Rome of Japan\u201d and most of its inhabitants were Christians. By 1611, it had ten churches and was divided into eight parishes, including a specifically Korean order.\n\n==Nature of early Christian community==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}\n[[Image:ChristNetsukeIvory17thcenturyJapan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Netsuke]] depicting Christ, 17th century, Japan]]\n\nDifferent groups of laymen supported Christian life in Japanese mission, e.g., d\u014djuku, kanb\u014d, and jihiyakusha helped the clergymen in activities like the celebration of Sunday liturgy in the absence of ordained clergy, religious education, preparation of confessions, and spiritual support of the sick. By the end of the 16th century kanb\u014d and jihiyakusha had similar responsibilities and also organized funerals and baptized children with permission to baptize from Rome. The kanb\u014d were those who had left secular life but not taken formal vows, while the jihiyakusha were married and had a profession.\n\nThese groups were fundamental to the mission, and depended on both the ecclesiastical hierarchy as well as the warlords who controlled the lands where they lived. Therefore, the success of the Japanese mission cannot be explained only as the result of the action of a brilliant group of missionaries or of the commercial and political interests of a few ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and traders.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Economic activities===\nThe Jesuits in Japan had to maintain economic self-sufficiency because they could not expect stable and sufficient payment from their patron, the King of [[Portugal]], the king allowing the Jesuits to engage in trade with Japan. Such economic activity can be found in the work of [[Francis Xavier]], the pioneer of Catholic missions in Japan, who covered the cost of missionary work through merchant trading. From the 1550s to the 1570s, the Jesuits covered all necessary expenses with trade profits and bought land in [[Portuguese India|India]].\n\nTheir officially recognized commercial activity was a fixed-amount entry into the Portuguese silk trade between Macau and Nagasaki. They financed to a certain amount the trade association in Macau, which purchased raw silk in Canton and sold it in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. They did not confine their commercial activity to the official silk market but expanded into unauthorized markets. For the Macau-Nagasaki trade, they dealt in silk fabrics, gold, musk and other goods including military supplies and slavery. Sometimes, they even got involved in Spanish trade, prohibited by the kings of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and antagonized the Portuguese traders.\n\nIt was mainly procurators who brokered Portuguese trade. They resided in Macau and Nagasaki, and accepted purchase commitments by Japanese customers such as the shogunate ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and wealthy merchants. By brokerage, the Jesuits could expect not only rebates but also favorable treatment from the authorities. For this reason, the office of procurator became an important post among the Jesuits in Japan. Although trade activities by the Jesuits ate into Portuguese trade interests, procurators continued their brokerage utilizing the authority of the Catholic Church. At the same time, Portuguese merchants required the assistance of procurators who were familiar with Japanese [[customs]], since they established no permanent trading post in Japan. Probably the most notable procurator was [[Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues (missionary)|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues]], who approached [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and even participated in the administration of Nagasaki.\n\nSuch commercial activities were contrary to the idea of honorable poverty that the priests held. But some Jesuits at this time placed the expansion of the society's influence before this ideal. Mendicant orders fiercely accused the Jesuits of being corrupt and even considered their activity as the primary reason for Japan's ban on Catholicism. Mendicant orders themselves were not necessarily uninvolved in commercial activities.\n\nJo\u00e3o Rodrigues  was a Jesuit missionary who became a fluent interpreter of Japanese life to the West. At age 16 he was assigned to the Jesuit Mission in Nagasaki in 1577 in a period of military and civil strife. He gained an unmatched fluency in speaking Japanese and was a lead interpreter in high level negotiations, as with Hideyoshi. He compiled essential reference books including a Japanese grammar, [[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam|Japanese-Portuguese dictionary]] with interpretative sections on Japanese life and culture, a history of the mission, and an introduction to Japanese culture.  As treasurer of the mission he handled business and worked with Portuguese shippers.<ref>[[Michael Cooper (historian)|Cooper, Michael]], \"Rodrigues in Japan, a Jesuit Missionary\", ''History Today'', April 1973, Vol. 23 Issue 4, pp 247\u2013255</ref>\n\n===Military activities===\n\nMany ''daimy\u014ds'' converted to Christianity to gain more favorable access to [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], used to make [[gunpowder]]. Between 1553 and 1620, 86 ''daimy\u014ds'' were officially baptized, and many more were sympathetic to the Christians.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Toshihiko\n  | first = Abe\n  | title = Japan's Hidden Face\n  | publisher = Bainbridgebooks/Trans-Atlantic Publications\n  | year = 1998\n  | isbn = 978-1-891696-05-3}}</ref>\n\nThe Jesuits provided various kinds of support including military support to Kirishitan ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' when they were threatened by non-Kirishitan ''daimy\u014ds''. Most notable was their support of [[Omura Sumitada]] and [[Arima Harunobu]], who fought against the anti-Catholic [[Ry\u016bz\u014dji Takanobu|Ryuzoji]] clan. \n\n[[\u014ctomo S\u014drin|\u014ctomo Sorin]] was a famous Christian daimyo, he fought alongside Portugueses in the [[Siege of Moji]]. \u014ctomo maintained an alliance with Christian Europeans throughout his military career. His wife, known to the Jesuits as [[\u014ctomo-Nata Jezebel]], was one of the precursors against Christianity. He later had to divorce her and declare war against [[Usa Jing\u016b|Usa Hachimang\u016b]] in which Jezebel was a priestess.\n\nIn the 1580s, Valignano believed in the effectiveness of military action and fortified Nagasaki and Mogi. In 1585, [[Gaspar Coelho]] asked the Spanish [[Philippines]] to send a fleet but the plan was rejected due to the shortness of its military capability.   Christians [[Protasio Arima]] and Paulo Okamoto were named as principals in an assassination plot to murder the magistrate in charge of the shogunate's most important port city of Nagasaki.\n\n==Toyotomi Hideyoshi==\nThe situation was changed when [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] reunified Japan. Once he became the ruler of Japan, Hideyoshi began to pay attention to external threats, particularly the expansion of European power in East Asia. In 1587, while trying to establish control of his new kingdom, in some parts of Kyushu, he encountered Buddhist temples that had been sacked by fanatical Catholics trying to convert the entire island.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Far East since 1500|last=Eckel|first=Paul E.|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1948|isbn=|location=New York|pages=131\u2013133}}</ref> This added to Hideyoshi's skepticism of the religion. However, the turning point for Catholic missions was the [[San Felipe incident (1596)|San Felipe incident]] in 1596, where in an attempt to recover his cargo, the Spanish captain of a shipwrecked trading vessel claimed that the missionaries were there to prepare Japan for conquest. These claims made Hideyoshi suspicious of the foreign religion.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Cooper\n  | first = Michael\n  | title = Rodrigues the Interpreter= An Early Jesuit in Japan and China\n  | publisher = Weatherhill, New York\n  | year = 1974\n  | quote = I have received information that in your kingdoms the promulgation of the law, i.e. Christianity, is a trick and deceit by which you overcome other kingdoms, he wrote in a letter to the Philippines in reply to the embassy led by [[Navarrete Fajardo]] in 1597.

Hideyoshi put Nagasaki under his direct rule to control Portuguese trade.\n\nWhen Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued the Bateren-tsuiho-rei, the Jesuits in Japan, led by Coelho, planned armed resistance. At first, they sought help from Kirishitan ''daimy\u014ds'' but the ''daimy\u014ds'' refused. Then they called for a deployment of reinforcements from their homeland and its colonies. But this plan was vetoed by Valignano. Like the Kirishitan ''daimy\u014ds'', he realized that a military campaign against Japan's powerful ruler would bring catastrophe to Catholicism in Japan. Valignano survived the crisis by laying all the blame on Coelho. In 1590, the Jesuits decided to stop intervening in the struggles between the ''daimy\u014ds'' and to disarm themselves. They only gave secret shipments of food and financial aid to Kirishitan ''[[daimy\u014d]]s''.\n\nOn February 5, 1597, twenty-six Christians \u2013 six [[Franciscan]] [[missionary|missionaries]], three Japanese [[Jesuits]] and seventeen Japanese [[laymen]] including three young boys \u2013 were executed by [[crucifixion]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. These individuals were raised on crosses and then pierced through with spears. The Martyrs of Japan were [[canonized]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] on June 8, 1862 by [[Pope Pius IX|Blessed Pius IX]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://home.newadvent.org/cathen/11755b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Sts.

On September 10, 1632, 55 Christians were martyred in Nagasaki in what became known as the Great Genna Martyrdom. At this time Catholicism was officially outlawed. The Church remained without clergy and theological teaching and practice went underground until the arrival of Western missionaries in the 19th century.\n\n==Tokugawa Ieyasu==\n\n[[Image:JapaneseDelegatesAndPopeGregory13.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The Japanese embassy of [[It\u014d Mancio]], with [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1585.]]\n\nAfter Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed power over Japan, in 1600. Like Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he disliked Christian activities in Japan but gave priority to trade with Portugal and Spain. He secured Portuguese trade in 1600. He negotiated with [[Manila]] to establish trade with the Philippines. The trade promotion made his policies toward Catholicism inconsistent. At the same time, in an attempt to wrest control of the Japan trade from the Catholic countries, Dutch and English traders advised the shogunate that Spain did indeed have territorial ambitions, and that Catholicism was Spain's principal means. In contrast, the Dutch and English promised that they would limit themselves to trading and would not conduct missionary activities in Japan.\n\n[[Image:HasekuraPrayer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] converted to [[Catholicism]] in [[Madrid]] in 1615.]]\n\nFollowing [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Toyotomi]]'s death in 1598, it seems that the Jesuits realized that the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was much stronger and more stable than Toyotomi Hideyoshi's administration, yet the mendicant orders relatively openly discussed military options. The Jesuits and the Mendicant Orders kept a lasting rivalry over the Japanese mission and attached to different imperial strategies.\n\nThe [[Tokugawa shogunate]] finally decided to ban Catholicism in 1614, and in the mid-17th century demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts.<ref name=\"Mullins\">{{cite journal\n| last = Mullins\n | first = Mark R.\n | year = 1990\n | title = Japanese Pentecostalism and the World of the Dead: a Study of Cultural Adaptation in Iesu no Mitama Kyokai\n | journal = Japanese Journal of Religious Studies\n | volume = 17\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 353\u2013374 | doi = 10.18874/jjrs.17.4.1990.353-374\n }}</ref> This marked the end of open Christianity in Japan. \nThe immediate cause of the prohibition was the [[Okamoto Daihachi incident]], a case of fraud involving Ieyasu's Catholic [[vavasor]], but there were also other reasons behind it. The shogunate was concerned about a possible invasion by the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines. In 1615, a [[Franciscan]] emissary of the Viceroy of [[New Spain]] asked the ''sh\u014dgun'' for land to build a Spanish fortress and this deepened Japan's suspicion against Catholicism and the  [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonial powers behind it. Domestically, the ban was closely related to measures against the [[Toyotomi]] clan. The statement on the \"Expulsion of all missionaries from Japan\", drafted by [[Zen]] monk Konchiin Suden (1563\u20131633) and issued in 1614 under the name of second Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (ruled 1605\u20131623), was considered the first official statement of a comprehensive control of Kirishitan.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Higashibaba\n  | first = Ikuo\n  | title = Christianity in Early Modern Japan: Kirishitan Belief and Practice\n  | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers, Incorporated\n  | quote = The Kirishitan band happened to reach Japan.

Once again, the main reason for this resistance was not the presence of a few priests but rather the self-organization of many communities. Forced to secrecy, and having a small number of clergymen working underground, the Japanese Church was able to recruit leadership from among lay members. Japanese children caused admiration among the Portuguese and seem to have participated actively in the resistance. Nagasaki remained a Christian city in the first decades of the 17th century, and during the general persecutions other confraternities were founded in Shimabara, Kinai and Franciscans in Edo.\n\n[[Image:Jesus on cross to step on.jpg|thumb|upright|Image of Christ used to reveal practicing Catholics and sympathizers.]]\n\nThe Buddhist [[ecclesiastical]] establishment was made responsible for verifying that a person was not a Christian through what became known as the \"temple guarantee system\" (terauke seido). By the 1630s, people were being required to produce a certificate of affiliation with a Buddhist temple as proof of religious orthodoxy, social acceptability, and loyalty to the regime.\n\nThe number of active Christians is estimated to have been around 200,000 in 1582.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08297a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia on Japan}}</ref> There were likely around 1,000 known martyrs during the missionary period.  Christians attach a great importance to martyrdom and persecution, and countless more people were dispossessed of their\nland and property leading to their subsequent death in poverty.\n\nThe Japanese government used [[Fumie]], pictures of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] meant to be trod upon, to reveal practicing Catholics and sympathizers. Anyone reluctant to step on the pictures was identified as Catholic and sent to Nagasaki. The policy of the Japanese government (Edo) was to turn Christians from their faith; if the Catholics refused to renounce their religion, they were [[torture]]d. Those who would not recant were typically executed on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]'s [[Mount Unzen]].\n\nThe [[Shimabara Rebellion]], led by a young Christian boy named [[Amakusa Shir\u014d|Amakusa Shir\u014d Tokisada]], took place in 1637. The Rebellion broke out over economic desperation and government oppression but later assumed a religious tone. About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. They are not considered martyrs by the [[Catholic Church]] since they took up arms for materialistic reasons. Many Japanese were deported to [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] or to the Spanish [[Philippines]]. Many [[Macanese people|Macanese]] and Japanese [[Mestizo]]s are the mixed-race descendants of the deported Japanese Catholics. Four hundred were officially deported by the government to Macau and Manila, but thousands of Japanese were pressured into moving voluntarily. About 10,000 Macanese and 3,000 Japanese were moved to Manila.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Kakure Kirishitan==\n{{Main|Kakure Kirishitan}}\n\n[[File:The Virgin Mary disguised as Kanon Japan.jpg|upright|left|thumb|The [[Virgin Mary]] disguised as [[Kannon]], Kirishitan cult, 17th century [[Japan]]. Salle des Martyrs, [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]].]]\n\n[[Image:Buddhist statue with hidden cross on back.jpg|upright|thumb|Buddhist statue with hidden cross on back, used by Christians in Japan to hide their real beliefs.]]\n\nThe Catholic remnant in Japan were driven underground and its members became known as the [[Kakure Kirishitan|\"Hidden Christians\"]]. Some priests remained in Japan illegally, including eighteen Jesuits, seven Franciscans, seven Dominicans, one Augustinian, five seculars and an unknown number of Jesuit [[irmao]] and [[dojuku]]. During the [[Edo period]], the [[Kakure Kirishitan]]s kept their faith. Biblical phrases or prayers were transferred orally from parent to child, and secret posts (Mizukata) were assigned in their underground community to baptize their children, all while regional governments continuously operated [[Fumie]] to expose Christians. Drawn from the oral histories of Japanese Catholic communities, [[Shusaku Endo]]'s acclaimed novel \"[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]\" provides detailed accounts of the persecution of Christian communities and the suppression of the Church.\n\nKakure [[Kirishitan]]s are called the \"hidden\" Christians because they continued to practice Christianity in secret. They worshipped in [[secret passage|secret rooms]] in private homes. As time went on, the figures of the [[saint]]s and the [[Virgin Mary]] were transformed into figurines that looked like the traditional statues of the [[Buddhism|Buddha]] and [[bodhisattvas]]. The prayers were adapted to sound like Buddhist chant, yet retained many untranslated words from [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[Bible]] was passed down orally, due to fears of printed works being confiscated by authorities. Because of the expulsion of the Catholic clergy in the 17th century, the Kakure Christian community relied on lay leaders to lead the services.\n\nIn some cases, the communities drifted away from Christian teachings. They lost the meaning of the prayers and their religion became a version of the [[Ancestor worship|cult of ancestors]], in which the ancestors happened to be their [[Christian martyrs]].\n\nMany secret Christians, some of whom had adopted these new ways of practicing Christianity, came out of hiding when religious freedom was [[Meiji Restoration|re-established in the mid-19th century]] and rejoined the Roman Catholic Church after renouncing their unorthodox, [[syncretism|syncretic]] practices. However, there were those who decided not to rejoin. They are known as the Hanare Kirishitan ({{nihongo2|\u96e2\u308c\u30ad\u30ea\u30b7\u30bf\u30f3}}, separated Christians).\n\n===Modern extinction of Hanare Kirishitans===\n[[Image:Maria Kannon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maria Kannon, Dehua Kiln Statue of Buddhist Kannon used for Christian worship in Japan, Nantoy\u014ds\u014d Collection, Japan.]]\n\nFollowing the legalization of Christianity and secularization of Japan, many Hanare Kirishitan lineages ended abruptly. Traditionally, boys learned the rituals and prayers from their fathers; when boys were uninterested or moved away from the homes, there would be no one left to continue the lineage.\n\nFor a while, Hanare Kirishitans were thought to have died out entirely, due to their tradition of secrecy. A group on [[Ikitsuki, Nagasaki|Ikitsuki Island]] in [[Nagasaki prefecture]], which had been overlooked by the Japanese government during the time of persecution, made their practices public in the 1980s and now perform them for audiences; however, these practices have acquired some attributes of theater, such as the telling of folktales and the use of statues and other images which most underground Christians had never created.\n\nThe anthropologist Christal Whelan uncovered the existence of genuine Hanare Kirishitans on the [[Got\u014d Islands]] where Kakure Kirishitans had once fled. There were only two surviving priests on the islands, both of whom were over 90, and they would not talk to each other. The few surviving laity had also all reached old age, and some of them no longer had any priests from their lineage and prayed alone. Although these Hanare Kirishitans had a strong tradition of secrecy, they agreed to be filmed for her documentary ''Otaiya''.<ref>http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0452.html</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery and return==\n\n[[File:Andries Beeckman - The Castle of Batavia.jpg|thumb|''The Castle of Batavia'' by Andries Beeckman, circa 1656. Japanese Christians appear in the foreground.]]\n\nJapan was opened to foreign interaction by [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] in 1853. It became possible for foreigners to live in Japan with the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States\u2013Japan)|Harris Treaty]] in 1858. Many Christian clergymen were sent from Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Churches, though proselytizing was still banned. In 1865, some of the Japanese who lived in [[Urakami]] village near [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] visited the new [[\u014cura Church]] which had been built by the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] ([[:fr:Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris|Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris]]) barely a month before. A female member of the group spoke to a French priest, [[Bernard Petitjean|Bernard Thadd\u00e9e Petitjean]], and revealed that their families had kept the Kirishitan faith. Those Kirishitan wanted to see the statue of the Virgin Mary with their own eyes, and to confirm that the priest was single and truly came from the Pope in Rome. After this interview, many Kirishitan thronged toward Petitjean. He investigated their underground organizations and discovered that they had kept the rite of baptism and the liturgical years without European priests for nearly 250 years. Petitjean's report surprised the Christian world; Pope [[Pius IX]] called it a miracle.\n\n[[File:Ebara Soroku.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ebara Soroku]], converting to Christianity in 1877. He was responsible for starting the Numazu Church. Later, Ebara served as chairman of the Tokyo [[YMCA]].]]\n\nThe [[Edo]] shogunate's edicts banning Christianity were still on the books, however, and thus the religion continued to be persecuted up to 1867, the last year of its rule. [[Robert Bruce Van Valkenburgh]], the American minister-resident in Japan, privately complained of this persecution to the Nagasaki magistrates, though little action was taken to stop it. The succeeding [[Meiji government]] initially continued in this vein and several thousand people were exiled ([[Urakami Yoban Kuzure]]). After Europe and the U.S. began to vocally criticize the persecution, the Japanese government realized that it needed to lift the ban in order to attain its interests. In 1873 the ban was lifted. Numerous exiles returned and began construction of the [[Urakami Cathedral]], which was completed in 1895.\n\nIt was later revealed that tens of thousands of Kirishitan still survived in some regions near Nagasaki. Some officially returned to the Catholic Church, while others remained apart from the Catholic Church and have stayed as Hanare Kirishitan, retaining their own traditional beliefs and their descendants asserting that they keep their ancestors' religion.<ref>Kentaro Miyazaki, \"Kakure Kirishitan  --Orasho, Figured Bass of Their Souls\", 2001, ''Nagasaki Shimbun Shinsho'' (in Japanese), {{ISBN|4-931493-40-8}}, pp.282\u2013283</ref> However, it became difficult for them to keep their community and rituals, so they have converted to [[Buddhism]] or [[Shinto]] eventually.<ref>Kentaro Miyazaki, \"Kakure Kirishitan  --Orasho, Figured Bass of Their Souls\", 2001, Nagasaki Shimbun Shinsho (in Japanese), {{ISBN|4-931493-40-8}}, pp.284\u2013286</ref> When Pope [[John Paul II]] visited Nagasaki in 1981, he baptized some young people from Kakure Kirishitan families \u2013 a rare occurrence.<ref>Kentaro Miyazaki, \"Kakure Kirishitan  --Orasho, Figured Bass of Their Souls\", 2001, ''Nagasaki Shimbun Shinsho'' (in Japanese), {{ISBN|4-931493-40-8}}, p.287</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|History|Christianity|Japan}}\n*[[Kakure Kirishitan]] (\"hidden Christian\") refers to the Japanese communities that continued to secretly practice a native form of Christianity in spite of persecution.

Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization. Although at the time of the demarcation, neither nation had any direct contact with Japan, that nation fell into the sphere of the Portuguese.\n\nThe countries disputed the attribution of Japan. Since neither could colonize it, the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan meant the exclusive right to trade with Japan. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits under [[Alessandro Valignano]] took the lead in proselytizing in Japan over the objection of the Spaniards. The fait accompli was approved in [[Pope Gregory XIII]]'s [[papal bull]] of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese diocese of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]. In 1588, the {{anchor|Diocese of Funai}}<!-- [[Diocese of Funai]] redirects here-->diocese of Funai (the [[Funai Domain]], centred on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]) was founded under Portuguese protection.\n\nIn rivalry with the Jesuits, Spanish-sponsored [[mendicant orders]] entered into Japan via [[Manila]]. While criticizing Jesuit activities, they actively lobbied the Pope. Their campaigns resulted in [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s decree of 1600, which allowed Spanish [[friars]] to enter Japan via [[Portuguese India]], and [[Pope Paul V]]'s decree of 1608, which abolished the restrictions on the route. The Portuguese accused Spanish Jesuits of working for their homeland instead of their patron. The power struggle between Jesuits and mendicant orders caused a schism within the diocese of Funai. Furthermore, mendicant orders tried in vain to establish a diocese on the [[Tohoku region]] that was to be independent from the Portuguese one.\n\nReligious rivalries between Catholics and Protestants reached Japan with the arrival of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[England|English]] traders in the early 17th century.  Although England withdrew from the operations in ten years under [[James I of England|James I]] due to lack of profitability, the Netherlands continued to trade with Japan and became the only European country that maintained trade relations with Japan until the 19th century. As trade competitors, the Protestant countries engaged in a negative campaign against Catholicism, and it subsequently affected [[shogunate]] policies toward the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal.\n\n==Francis Xavier==\n[[Image:Japanese Christian bell.jpg|upright|thumb|Japanese-Portuguese Bell Inscribed 1570, Nantoy\u014ds\u014d Collection, Japan]]\n\n[[Francis Xavier]] was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  In [[Portuguese Malacca]] in December 1547, Xavier met a Japanese man from [[Kagoshima]] named [[Anjir\u014d]]. Anjir\u014d had heard from Xavier in 1545 and had travelled from Kagoshima to Malacca with the purpose of meeting with him. Having been charged with murder, Anjir\u014d had fled Japan. He told Xavier extensively about his former life and the customs and culture of his beloved homeland. Anjir\u014d helped Xavier as a mediator and translator for the mission to Japan that now seemed much more possible. \"I asked [Anjir\u014d] whether the Japanese would become Christians if I went with him to this country, and he replied that they would not do so immediately, but would first ask me many questions and see what I knew. Above all, they would want to see whether my life corresponded with my teaching.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nXavier returned to India in January 1548. The next 15 months were occupied with various journeys and administrative measures in India. Then, due to displeasure at what he considered un-Christian life and manners on the part of the Portuguese which impeded missionary work, he left India and traveled to East Asia. He left Goa on 15 April 1549, stopped at Malacca and visited [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. He was accompanied by Anjir\u014d, two other Japanese men, the father [[Cosme de Torr\u00e8s]] and Brother Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. He had taken with him presents for the \"[[Japanese Emperor|King of Japan]]\" since he was intending to introduce himself as the [[Apostolic Nuncio]].\n\nXavier reached Japan on 27 July 1549, with Anjir\u014d and three other Jesuits, but it was not until 15 August that he went ashore at  [[Kagoshima]], the principal port of the province of [[Satsuma Province|Satsuma]] on the island of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner and was hosted by Anjir\u014d's family until October 1550. From October to December 1550, he resided in [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]]. Shortly before Christmas, he left for [[Kyoto]] but failed to meet with the Emperor. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where he was permitted to preach by the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of the province. However, lacking fluency in the Japanese language, he had to limit himself to reading aloud a Japanese translation of a [[catechism]].\n\nThe Japanese people were not easily converted; many of the people were already Buddhist or Shinto. Francis tried to combat the disposition of some of the Japanese that a God who had created everything, including evil, could not be good. The concept of Hell was also a struggle; the Japanese were bothered by the idea of their ancestors living in Hell. Despite Francis' different religion, he felt that they were good people, much like Europeans, and could be converted.<ref>Ellis, Robert Richmond. \u201cThe Best Thus Far Discovered\u201d: The Japanese in the Letters of St. Francisco Xavier. ''Hispanic Review'', Vol. 71 No. 2 (Spring 2003), pp. 155-169 University of Pennsylvania Press. 30 November 2008 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3247185 jstor]</ref><ref>Xavier, Francis. ''The Letters and Instructions of Francis Xavier''. Translated by M. Joseph Costellos, S.J. St Louis: The Institute of Jesuit Sources, 1992</ref>\n\nXavier brought with him paintings of the Madonna and the Madonna and Child. These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language. Artwork continued to play a role in Francis\u2019 teachings in Asia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nXavier was welcomed by the [[Shingon]] monks since he used the word ''[[Vairocana|Dainichi]]'' for the Christian God; attempting to adapt the concept to local traditions. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to ''Deusu'' from the Latin and Portuguese ''Deus''. The monks later realized that Xavier was preaching a rival religion and grew more aggressive towards his attempts at conversion.\n\nWhen Xavier arrived in Japan, the country was embroiled in a nationwide civil war. Neither the emperor nor the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Ashikaga]] ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' could exercise power over the nation. At first, Xavier planned to gain permission for building a mission from the emperor but was disappointed with the devastation of the imperial residence. The Jesuits approached ''daimy\u014d'' in southwestern Japan and succeeded in converting some of them. One reason for their conversion may have been the Portuguese trade in which the Jesuits acted as brokers. The Jesuits recognized this and approached local rulers with offers of trade and exotic gifts.\n\nThe Jesuits believed that it was most effective to seek to influence people in power and to pass the religion downward to the commoners. At the least, they needed to gain permission from local rulers to propagate Catholicism within their domains. Indeed, as [[feudal]] lords converted to Catholicism, the number of believers within their territories also drastically increased.{{Citation needed|reason=this is a very interesting topic and we could use some sources about this correlation|date=July 2010}} After the [[edict]] banning Christianity, there were communities that kept practicing Catholicism without any contact with the Church until missionaries were able to return much later.\n\nWhen Xavier disembarked in Kagoshima, the principal chiefs of the two branches of the Shimazu family, Sanehisa and Katsuhisa, were warring for the sovereignty of their lands. Katsuhisa adopted Takahisa Shimazu, who in 1542 was accepted as head of the clan, having previously received the Portuguese merchants on Tanegashima Island and learned about the use of firearms. Later, he met Xavier himself at the castle of Uchiujijo and permitted the conversion of his vassals.\n\nHaving a religious background, Takahisa showed himself to be benevolent and already allowed freedom of worship, but did not help the missionaries or favor their church. Failing to find a way to the centre of affairs, the court of the Emperor, Xavier soon tired and left to Yamaguchi, thus beginning the Yamaguchi period.<ref>Lopez-Gay, St Francis Xavier and the Shimazu Family, ''Bulletin of Portuguese/Japanese Studies'', Uni. Nova de Lisboa, Portugal 2003</ref> Xavier stayed in Yamaguchi for two months on his way to an abortive audience with the Emperor in Kyoto. Yamaguchi was a prosperous and refined city, and its leaders, the Ouchi family, were aware that Xavier's journey to Japan had begun after the completion of his mission in India.\n\nThey took Catholicism for some sort of new sect of Buddhism, and were curious to know of the priest's doctrine. Tolerant but shrewd, their eyes less on baptism than the Portuguese cargoes from Macau, they granted the Jesuit permission to preach. The uncompromising Xavier took to the streets of the city denouncing, among other things, infanticide, idolatry, and homosexuality (the last being widely accepted at the time). Misunderstandings were inevitable.\n\nThe Jesuits attempted to expand their activity to [[Kyoto]] and the surrounding regions. In 1559, Gaspar Vilela obtained permission from [[Ashikaga Yoshiteru]] to teach Christianity. This license was the same as those given to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temples]], so special treatment cannot be confirmed regarding the Jesuits. On the other hand, [[Emperor \u014cgimachi]] issued edicts to ban Catholicism in 1565 and 1568. The orders of the Emperor and the ''sh\u014dgun'' made little difference.\n\nChristians refer positively to [[Oda Nobunaga]], who died in the middle of the unification of Japan. He favored the Jesuit missionary [[Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is]] and generally tolerated Christianity. But overall, he undertook no remarkable policies toward Catholicism. Actually, Catholic power in his domain was trivial because he did not conquer western Japan, where the Jesuits were based.\n\nWith the passage of time, Xavier's sojourn in Japan could be considered somewhat fruitful as attested by congregations established in [[Hirado]], Yamaguchi and [[Bungo Province|Bungo]]. Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India.\n\nFor 45 years, the Jesuits were the only Christian missionaries in Asia, and then the Franciscans began proselytizing as well.\n\n==Propagation strategy==\nChristian books were published in Japanese from the 1590s on, some with more than one thousand copies and from 1601 a printing press was established under the supervision of Soin Goto Thomas, a citizen of Nagasaki with thirty Japanese working full-time at the press. Liturgical calendars were also printed after 1592 until at least 1634. Christian solidarity made also possible missionary mail delivery throughout the country until the end of the 1620s.\n\n==Early expansion==\n[[Image:JapaneseVotiveAltar.JPG|thumb|A Japanese votive altar, [[Nanban art|Nanban]] style.

Its uniqueness was emphasized by [[Alessandro Valignano]] since 1582, who promoted a deeper accommodation of Japanese culture. Japan was then the sole overseas country in which all members of those confraternities were locals, as was the case with Christian missions in Mexico, Peru, Brazil, the Philippines, or India, in spite of the presence of a colonial elite.\n\nMost Japanese Christians lived in Kyushu, but Christianization was now a regional phenomenon and had a national impact. By the end of the 16th century it was possible to find baptized people in virtually every province of Japan, many of them organized in communities. On the eve of the [[Battle of Sekigahara|Sekigahara]] battle, fifteen ''daimy\u014ds'' were baptized, and their domains stretched from Hyuga in Southeast Kyushu to Dewa in North Honsh\u016b (see Costa 2003). Hundreds of churches had been built throughout Japan.\n\nAccepted on a national scale, Christianity was also successful among different social groups from the poor to the rich, peasants, traders, sailors, warriors, or courtesans. Most of the daily activities of the Church were performed by Japanese from the beginning, giving the Japanese Church a native face, and this was one of the reasons for its success. By 1590, there were seventy native brothers in Japan, fully one half of Jesuits in Japan and fifteen percent of all Jesuits who were working in Asia.\n\nThe [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|1592 War between Japan and Korea]] also provided Westerners with a rare opportunity to visit Korea. Under orders of Gomaz, the Jesuit [[Gregorious de Cespedes]] arrived in Korea with a Japanese monk for the purposes of ministering to the Japanese troops. He stayed there for approximately 18 months, until April or May 1595, thus being on record as the first European missionary to visit the Korean peninsula but was unable to make any inroads. The 'Annual Letters of Japan' made a substantial contribution to the introduction of Korea to Europe, Francis Xavier having crossed paths with Korean envoys dispatched to Japan during 1550 and 1551.\n\nThe Japanese missions were economically self-sufficient. Nagasaki\u2019s miseric\u00f3rdias became rich and powerful institutions which every year received large donations. The brotherhood grew in numbers to over 100 by 1585 and 150 in 1609. Controlled by the elite of Nagasaki, and not by Portuguese, it had two hospitals (one for lepers) and a large church. By 1606, there already existed a feminine religious order called ''Miyako no Bikuni'' (Nuns of Kyoto) which accepted Korean converts such as Marina Pak, baptized in Nagasaki.<ref>Oliveira e Costa, Jo\u00e3o Paulo</ref> Nagasaki was called \u201cthe Rome of Japan\u201d and most of its inhabitants were Christians. By 1611, it had ten churches and was divided into eight parishes, including a specifically Korean order.\n\n==Nature of early Christian community==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}\n[[Image:ChristNetsukeIvory17thcenturyJapan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Netsuke]] depicting Christ, 17th century, Japan]]\n\nDifferent groups of laymen supported Christian life in Japanese mission, e.g., d\u014djuku, kanb\u014d, and jihiyakusha helped the clergymen in activities like the celebration of Sunday liturgy in the absence of ordained clergy, religious education, preparation of confessions, and spiritual support of the sick. By the end of the 16th century kanb\u014d and jihiyakusha had similar responsibilities and also organized funerals and baptized children with permission to baptize from Rome. The kanb\u014d were those who had left secular life but not taken formal vows, while the jihiyakusha were married and had a profession.\n\nThese groups were fundamental to the mission, and depended on both the ecclesiastical hierarchy as well as the warlords who controlled the lands where they lived. Therefore, the success of the Japanese mission cannot be explained only as the result of the action of a brilliant group of missionaries or of the commercial and political interests of a few ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and traders.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Economic activities===\nThe Jesuits in Japan had to maintain economic self-sufficiency because they could not expect stable and sufficient payment from their patron, the King of [[Portugal]], the king allowing the Jesuits to engage in trade with Japan. Such economic activity can be found in the work of [[Francis Xavier]], the pioneer of Catholic missions in Japan, who covered the cost of missionary work through merchant trading. From the 1550s to the 1570s, the Jesuits covered all necessary expenses with trade profits and bought land in [[Portuguese India|India]].\n\nTheir officially recognized commercial activity was a fixed-amount entry into the Portuguese silk trade between Macau and Nagasaki. They financed to a certain amount the trade association in Macau, which purchased raw silk in Canton and sold it in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. They did not confine their commercial activity to the official silk market but expanded into unauthorized markets. For the Macau-Nagasaki trade, they dealt in silk fabrics, gold, musk and other goods including military supplies and slavery. Sometimes, they even got involved in Spanish trade, prohibited by the kings of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and antagonized the Portuguese traders.\n\nIt was mainly procurators who brokered Portuguese trade. They resided in Macau and Nagasaki, and accepted purchase commitments by Japanese customers such as the shogunate ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' and wealthy merchants. By brokerage, the Jesuits could expect not only rebates but also favorable treatment from the authorities. For this reason, the office of procurator became an important post among the Jesuits in Japan. Although trade activities by the Jesuits ate into Portuguese trade interests, procurators continued their brokerage utilizing the authority of the Catholic Church. At the same time, Portuguese merchants required the assistance of procurators who were familiar with Japanese [[customs]], since they established no permanent trading post in Japan. Probably the most notable procurator was [[Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues (missionary)|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues]], who approached [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and even participated in the administration of Nagasaki.\n\nSuch commercial activities were contrary to the idea of honorable poverty that the priests held. But some Jesuits at this time placed the expansion of the society's influence before this ideal. Mendicant orders fiercely accused the Jesuits of being corrupt and even considered their activity as the primary reason for Japan's ban on Catholicism. Mendicant orders themselves were not necessarily uninvolved in commercial activities.\n\nJo\u00e3o Rodrigues  was a Jesuit missionary who became a fluent interpreter of Japanese life to the West. At age 16 he was assigned to the Jesuit Mission in Nagasaki in 1577 in a period of military and civil strife. He gained an unmatched fluency in speaking Japanese and was a lead interpreter in high level negotiations, as with Hideyoshi. He compiled essential reference books including a Japanese grammar, [[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam|Japanese-Portuguese dictionary]] with interpretative sections on Japanese life and culture, a history of the mission, and an introduction to Japanese culture.  As treasurer of the mission he handled business and worked with Portuguese shippers.<ref>[[Michael Cooper (historian)|Cooper, Michael]], \"Rodrigues in Japan, a Jesuit Missionary\", ''History Today'', April 1973, Vol. 23 Issue 4, pp 247\u2013255</ref>\n\n===Military activities===\n\nMany ''daimy\u014ds'' converted to Christianity to gain more favorable access to [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], used to make [[gunpowder]]. Between 1553 and 1620, 86 ''daimy\u014ds'' were officially baptized, and many more were sympathetic to the Christians.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Toshihiko\n  | first = Abe\n  | title = Japan's Hidden Face\n  | publisher = Bainbridgebooks/Trans-Atlantic Publications\n  | year = 1998\n  | isbn = 978-1-891696-05-3}}</ref>\n\nThe Jesuits provided various kinds of support including military support to Kirishitan ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' when they were threatened by non-Kirishitan ''daimy\u014ds''. Most notable was their support of [[Omura Sumitada]] and [[Arima Harunobu]], who fought against the anti-Catholic [[Ry\u016bz\u014dji Takanobu|Ryuzoji]] clan. \n\n[[\u014ctomo S\u014drin|\u014ctomo Sorin]] was a famous Christian daimyo, he fought alongside Portugueses in the [[Siege of Moji]]. \u014ctomo maintained an alliance with Christian Europeans throughout his military career. His wife, known to the Jesuits as [[\u014ctomo-Nata Jezebel]], was one of the precursors against Christianity. He later had to divorce her and declare war against [[Usa Jing\u016b|Usa Hachimang\u016b]] in which Jezebel was a priestess.\n\nIn the 1580s, Valignano believed in the effectiveness of military action and fortified Nagasaki and Mogi. In 1585, [[Gaspar Coelho]] asked the Spanish [[Philippines]] to send a fleet but the plan was rejected due to the shortness of its military capability.   Christians [[Protasio Arima]] and Paulo Okamoto were named as principals in an assassination plot to murder the magistrate in charge of the shogunate's most important port city of Nagasaki.\n\n==Toyotomi Hideyoshi==\nThe situation was changed when [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] reunified Japan. Once he became the ruler of Japan, Hideyoshi began to pay attention to external threats, particularly the expansion of European power in East Asia. In 1587, while trying to establish control of his new kingdom, in some parts of Kyushu, he encountered Buddhist temples that had been sacked by fanatical Catholics trying to convert the entire island.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Far East since 1500|last=Eckel|first=Paul E.|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1948|isbn=|location=New York|pages=131\u2013133}}</ref> This added to Hideyoshi's skepticism of the religion. However, the turning point for Catholic missions was the [[San Felipe incident (1596)|San Felipe incident]] in 1596, where in an attempt to recover his cargo, the Spanish captain of a shipwrecked trading vessel claimed that the missionaries were there to prepare Japan for conquest. These claims made Hideyoshi suspicious of the foreign religion.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Cooper\n  | first = Michael\n  | title = Rodrigues the Interpreter= An Early Jesuit in Japan and China\n  | publisher = Weatherhill, New York\n  | year = 1974\n  | quote = I have received information that in your kingdoms the promulgation of the law, i.e. Christianity, is a trick and deceit by which you overcome other kingdoms, he wrote in a letter to the Philippines in reply to the embassy led by [[Navarrete Fajardo]] in 1597.

Hideyoshi put Nagasaki under his direct rule to control Portuguese trade.\n\nWhen Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued the Bateren-tsuiho-rei, the Jesuits in Japan, led by Coelho, planned armed resistance. At first, they sought help from Kirishitan ''daimy\u014ds'' but the ''daimy\u014ds'' refused. Then they called for a deployment of reinforcements from their homeland and its colonies. But this plan was vetoed by Valignano. Like the Kirishitan ''daimy\u014ds'', he realized that a military campaign against Japan's powerful ruler would bring catastrophe to Catholicism in Japan. Valignano survived the crisis by laying all the blame on Coelho. In 1590, the Jesuits decided to stop intervening in the struggles between the ''daimy\u014ds'' and to disarm themselves. They only gave secret shipments of food and financial aid to Kirishitan ''[[daimy\u014d]]s''.\n\nOn February 5, 1597, twenty-six Christians \u2013 six [[Franciscan]] [[missionary|missionaries]], three Japanese [[Jesuits]] and seventeen Japanese [[laymen]] including three young boys \u2013 were executed by [[crucifixion]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. These individuals were raised on crosses and then pierced through with spears. The Martyrs of Japan were [[canonized]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] on June 8, 1862 by [[Pope Pius IX|Blessed Pius IX]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://home.newadvent.org/cathen/11755b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Sts.

Paul Miki and his Companions'', commemorated on February 6, February 5, the date of their death, being the feast of [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]].\n\nPersecution continued sporadically, breaking out again in 1613 and 1630. On September 10, 1632, 55 Christians were martyred in Nagasaki in what became known as the Great Genna Martyrdom. At this time Catholicism was officially outlawed. The Church remained without clergy and theological teaching and practice went underground until the arrival of Western missionaries in the 19th century.\n\n==Tokugawa Ieyasu==\n\n[[Image:JapaneseDelegatesAndPopeGregory13.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The Japanese embassy of [[It\u014d Mancio]], with [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1585.]]\n\nAfter Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] assumed power over Japan, in 1600. Like Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he disliked Christian activities in Japan but gave priority to trade with Portugal and Spain. He secured Portuguese trade in 1600. He negotiated with [[Manila]] to establish trade with the Philippines. The trade promotion made his policies toward Catholicism inconsistent. At the same time, in an attempt to wrest control of the Japan trade from the Catholic countries, Dutch and English traders advised the shogunate that Spain did indeed have territorial ambitions, and that Catholicism was Spain's principal means. In contrast, the Dutch and English promised that they would limit themselves to trading and would not conduct missionary activities in Japan.\n\n[[Image:HasekuraPrayer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] converted to [[Catholicism]] in [[Madrid]] in 1615.]]\n\nFollowing [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Toyotomi]]'s death in 1598, it seems that the Jesuits realized that the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was much stronger and more stable than Toyotomi Hideyoshi's administration, yet the mendicant orders relatively openly discussed military options. The Jesuits and the Mendicant Orders kept a lasting rivalry over the Japanese mission and attached to different imperial strategies.\n\nThe [[Tokugawa shogunate]] finally decided to ban Catholicism in 1614, and in the mid-17th century demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries and the execution of all converts.<ref name=\"Mullins\">{{cite journal\n| last = Mullins\n | first = Mark R.\n | year = 1990\n | title = Japanese Pentecostalism and the World of the Dead: a Study of Cultural Adaptation in Iesu no Mitama Kyokai\n | journal = Japanese Journal of Religious Studies\n | volume = 17\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 353\u2013374 | doi = 10.18874/jjrs.17.4.1990.353-374\n }}</ref> This marked the end of open Christianity in Japan. \nThe immediate cause of the prohibition was the [[Okamoto Daihachi incident]], a case of fraud involving Ieyasu's Catholic [[vavasor]], but there were also other reasons behind it. The shogunate was concerned about a possible invasion by the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines. In 1615, a [[Franciscan]] emissary of the Viceroy of [[New Spain]] asked the ''sh\u014dgun'' for land to build a Spanish fortress and this deepened Japan's suspicion against Catholicism and the  [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonial powers behind it. Domestically, the ban was closely related to measures against the [[Toyotomi]] clan. The statement on the \"Expulsion of all missionaries from Japan\", drafted by [[Zen]] monk Konchiin Suden (1563\u20131633) and issued in 1614 under the name of second Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (ruled 1605\u20131623), was considered the first official statement of a comprehensive control of Kirishitan.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Higashibaba\n  | first = Ikuo\n  | title = Christianity in Early Modern Japan: Kirishitan Belief and Practice\n  | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers, Incorporated\n  | quote = The Kirishitan band happened to reach Japan.

Once again, the main reason for this resistance was not the presence of a few priests but rather the self-organization of many communities. Forced to secrecy, and having a small number of clergymen working underground, the Japanese Church was able to recruit leadership from among lay members. Japanese children caused admiration among the Portuguese and seem to have participated actively in the resistance. Nagasaki remained a Christian city in the first decades of the 17th century, and during the general persecutions other confraternities were founded in Shimabara, Kinai and Franciscans in Edo.\n\n[[Image:Jesus on cross to step on.jpg|thumb|upright|Image of Christ used to reveal practicing Catholics and sympathizers.]]\n\nThe Buddhist [[ecclesiastical]] establishment was made responsible for verifying that a person was not a Christian through what became known as the \"temple guarantee system\" (terauke seido). By the 1630s, people were being required to produce a certificate of affiliation with a Buddhist temple as proof of religious orthodoxy, social acceptability, and loyalty to the regime.\n\nThe number of active Christians is estimated to have been around 200,000 in 1582.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08297a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia on Japan}}</ref> There were likely around 1,000 known martyrs during the missionary period.  Christians attach a great importance to martyrdom and persecution, and countless more people were dispossessed of their\nland and property leading to their subsequent death in poverty.\n\nThe Japanese government used [[Fumie]], pictures of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] meant to be trod upon, to reveal practicing Catholics and sympathizers. Anyone reluctant to step on the pictures was identified as Catholic and sent to Nagasaki. The policy of the Japanese government (Edo) was to turn Christians from their faith; if the Catholics refused to renounce their religion, they were [[torture]]d. Those who would not recant were typically executed on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]'s [[Mount Unzen]].\n\nThe [[Shimabara Rebellion]], led by a young Christian boy named [[Amakusa Shir\u014d|Amakusa Shir\u014d Tokisada]], took place in 1637. The Rebellion broke out over economic desperation and government oppression but later assumed a religious tone. About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. They are not considered martyrs by the [[Catholic Church]] since they took up arms for materialistic reasons. Many Japanese were deported to [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] or to the Spanish [[Philippines]]. Many [[Macanese people|Macanese]] and Japanese [[Mestizo]]s are the mixed-race descendants of the deported Japanese Catholics. Four hundred were officially deported by the government to Macau and Manila, but thousands of Japanese were pressured into moving voluntarily. About 10,000 Macanese and 3,000 Japanese were moved to Manila.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Kakure Kirishitan==\n{{Main|Kakure Kirishitan}}\n\n[[File:The Virgin Mary disguised as Kanon Japan.jpg|upright|left|thumb|The [[Virgin Mary]] disguised as [[Kannon]], Kirishitan cult, 17th century [[Japan]].

Some priests remained in Japan illegally, including eighteen Jesuits, seven Franciscans, seven Dominicans, one Augustinian, five seculars and an unknown number of Jesuit [[irmao]] and [[dojuku]]. During the [[Edo period]], the [[Kakure Kirishitan]]s kept their faith. Biblical phrases or prayers were transferred orally from parent to child, and secret posts (Mizukata) were assigned in their underground community to baptize their children, all while regional governments continuously operated [[Fumie]] to expose Christians. Drawn from the oral histories of Japanese Catholic communities, [[Shusaku Endo]]'s acclaimed novel \"[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]\" provides detailed accounts of the persecution of Christian communities and the suppression of the Church.\n\nKakure [[Kirishitan]]s are called the \"hidden\" Christians because they continued to practice Christianity in secret. They worshipped in [[secret passage|secret rooms]] in private homes. As time went on, the figures of the [[saint]]s and the [[Virgin Mary]] were transformed into figurines that looked like the traditional statues of the [[Buddhism|Buddha]] and [[bodhisattvas]]. The prayers were adapted to sound like Buddhist chant, yet retained many untranslated words from [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[Bible]] was passed down orally, due to fears of printed works being confiscated by authorities. Because of the expulsion of the Catholic clergy in the 17th century, the Kakure Christian community relied on lay leaders to lead the services.\n\nIn some cases, the communities drifted away from Christian teachings. They lost the meaning of the prayers and their religion became a version of the [[Ancestor worship|cult of ancestors]], in which the ancestors happened to be their [[Christian martyrs]].\n\nMany secret Christians, some of whom had adopted these new ways of practicing Christianity, came out of hiding when religious freedom was [[Meiji Restoration|re-established in the mid-19th century]] and rejoined the Roman Catholic Church after renouncing their unorthodox, [[syncretism|syncretic]] practices. However, there were those who decided not to rejoin. They are known as the Hanare Kirishitan ({{nihongo2|\u96e2\u308c\u30ad\u30ea\u30b7\u30bf\u30f3}}, separated Christians).\n\n===Modern extinction of Hanare Kirishitans===\n[[Image:Maria Kannon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maria Kannon, Dehua Kiln Statue of Buddhist Kannon used for Christian worship in Japan, Nantoy\u014ds\u014d Collection, Japan.]]\n\nFollowing the legalization of Christianity and secularization of Japan, many Hanare Kirishitan lineages ended abruptly. Traditionally, boys learned the rituals and prayers from their fathers; when boys were uninterested or moved away from the homes, there would be no one left to continue the lineage.\n\nFor a while, Hanare Kirishitans were thought to have died out entirely, due to their tradition of secrecy. A group on [[Ikitsuki, Nagasaki|Ikitsuki Island]] in [[Nagasaki prefecture]], which had been overlooked by the Japanese government during the time of persecution, made their practices public in the 1980s and now perform them for audiences; however, these practices have acquired some attributes of theater, such as the telling of folktales and the use of statues and other images which most underground Christians had never created.\n\nThe anthropologist Christal Whelan uncovered the existence of genuine Hanare Kirishitans on the [[Got\u014d Islands]] where Kakure Kirishitans had once fled. There were only two surviving priests on the islands, both of whom were over 90, and they would not talk to each other. The few surviving laity had also all reached old age, and some of them no longer had any priests from their lineage and prayed alone. Although these Hanare Kirishitans had a strong tradition of secrecy, they agreed to be filmed for her documentary ''Otaiya''.<ref>http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0452.html</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery and return==\n\n[[File:Andries Beeckman - The Castle of Batavia.jpg|thumb|''The Castle of Batavia'' by Andries Beeckman, circa 1656.

It became possible for foreigners to live in Japan with the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States\u2013Japan)|Harris Treaty]] in 1858. Many Christian clergymen were sent from Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox Churches, though proselytizing was still banned. In 1865, some of the Japanese who lived in [[Urakami]] village near [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] visited the new [[\u014cura Church]] which had been built by the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]] ([[:fr:Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris|Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris]]) barely a month before. A female member of the group spoke to a French priest, [[Bernard Petitjean|Bernard Thadd\u00e9e Petitjean]], and revealed that their families had kept the Kirishitan faith. Those Kirishitan wanted to see the statue of the Virgin Mary with their own eyes, and to confirm that the priest was single and truly came from the Pope in Rome. After this interview, many Kirishitan thronged toward Petitjean. He investigated their underground organizations and discovered that they had kept the rite of baptism and the liturgical years without European priests for nearly 250 years. Petitjean\u2019s report surprised the Christian world; Pope [[Pius IX]] called it a miracle.\n\n[[File:Ebara Soroku.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ebara Soroku]], converting to Christianity in 1877. He was responsible for starting the Numazu Church. Later, Ebara served as chairman of the Tokyo [[YMCA]].]]\n\nThe [[Edo]] shogunate's edicts banning Christianity were still on the books, however, and thus the religion continued to be persecuted up to 1867, the last year of its rule. [[Robert Bruce Van Valkenburgh]], the American minister-resident in Japan, privately complained of this persecution to the Nagasaki magistrates, though little action was taken to stop it. The succeeding [[Meiji government]] initially continued in this vein and several thousand people were exiled ([[Urakami Yoban Kuzure]]). After Europe and the U.S. began to vocally criticize the persecution, the Japanese government realized that it needed to lift the ban in order to attain its interests. In 1873 the ban was lifted. Numerous exiles returned and began construction of the [[Urakami Cathedral]], which was completed in 1895.\n\nIt was later revealed that tens of thousands of Kirishitan still survived in some regions near Nagasaki. Some officially returned to the Catholic Church, while others remained apart from the Catholic Church and have stayed as Hanare Kirishitan, retaining their own traditional beliefs and their descendants asserting that they keep their ancestors' religion.<ref>Kentaro Miyazaki, \"Kakure Kirishitan  --Orasho, Figured Bass of Their Souls\", 2001, ''Nagasaki Shimbun Shinsho'' (in Japanese), {{ISBN|4-931493-40-8}}, pp.282\u2013283</ref> However, it became difficult for them to keep their community and rituals, so they have converted to [[Buddhism]] or [[Shinto]] eventually.<ref>Kentaro Miyazaki, \"Kakure Kirishitan  --Orasho, Figured Bass of Their Souls\", 2001, Nagasaki Shimbun Shinsho (in Japanese), {{ISBN|4-931493-40-8}}, pp.284\u2013286</ref> When Pope [[John Paul II]] visited Nagasaki in 1981, he baptized some young people from Kakure Kirishitan families \u2013 a rare occurrence.<ref>Kentaro Miyazaki, \"Kakure Kirishitan  --Orasho, Figured Bass of Their Souls\", 2001, ''Nagasaki Shimbun Shinsho'' (in Japanese), {{ISBN|4-931493-40-8}}, p.287</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|History|Christianity|Japan}}\n*[[Kakure Kirishitan]] (\"hidden Christian\") refers to the Japanese communities that continued to secretly practice a native form of Christianity in spite of persecution.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

{"title_page": "History of Catholic education in the United States", "text_new": "The '''History of Catholic Education in The United States''' extends from the early colonial era in Louisiana and Maryland to the parochial school system set up in most parishes in the 19th century, to hundreds of colleges, all down to the present.\n\n==Colonial era==\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\nThere was a small Catholic population in the English colonies, chiefly in Maryland. It supported local schools, often under Jesuit auspices. The small Catholic Spanish communities in New Mexico and California, which joined the United States in 1848, had little in the way of organized schooling.\n\nMuch more important were schools of New Orleans, under Spanish and French control until 1803. Well-to-do families sent their children to private Catholic schools run by Ursulines and other orders of nuns. The Sisters of the Holy Family brought literacy and training in job skills to both free and enslaved black girls.<ref>Donna Porche-Frilot and Petra Munro Hendry, \"'Whatever Diversity of Shade May Appear': Catholic Women Religious Educators in Louisiana, 1727-1862,\" ''Catholic Southwest'' (2010) 21: 34-62.</ref>  The earliest continually operating school for girls in the United States is [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans)|Ursuline Academy]] in [[New Orleans]]. It was founded in 1727 by the [[Ursulines|Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula]]. The Academy graduated the first female pharmacist, and the first woman to contribute a book of literary merit. It contained the first convent. It was the first free school and first retreat center for ladies, and first classes for female African-American slaves, free women of color, and Native Americans. In the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley, Ursulines provided the first center of social welfare in the Mississippi Valley, first boarding school in Louisiana and the first school of music in New Orleans.<ref>Robenstine Clark, \"French Colonial Policy and the Education of Women and Minorities: Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth Century,\" ''History of Education Quarterly'' (1992) 32#2 pp. 193-211 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/368985 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Parochial schools==\nAs the nation was mostly Protestant in the 19th century, there was anti-Catholic sentiment related to heavy immigration from Catholic Ireland after the 1840s, and a feeling that Catholic children should be educated in public schools to become American. In the 1880s most states passed a constitutional amendment, called [[Blaine Amendments]], forbidding tax money be used to fund [[parochial schools]], which affected also Lutherans and other denominations that operated schools.  By 1890 the Irish, who controlled the Church in the U.S., had built an extensive network of parishes and parish schools (\"parochial schools\") across the urban Northeast and Midwest. The Irish and other Catholic ethnic groups looked to parochial schools not only to protect their religion, but to enhance their culture and language.<ref>Timothy Walch, ''Parish School: American Catholic Parochial Education From Colonial Times to the Present'' (2003)</ref><ref>James J. Hennesey, ''American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States'' (1983)  p 172</ref>\n\nThe main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by [[Blaine Amendments|strong opposition to any public funding]] of parochial schools.<ref>Thomas E. Buckley, \"A Mandate for Anti-Catholicism: The Blaine Amendment,\" ''America'' 27 September 2004, 18\u201321.</ref>   The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers. In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the [[National Catholic Educational Association|Catholic Educational Association]] which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 262-74</ref> \n \nIn the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior conditions compared to the public schools, and fewer well-trained teachers.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 286-91</ref><ref>James W. Sanders, ''The Education of an urban Minority: Catholics in Chicago, 1833\u20131965'' (Oxford University Press, 1977).</ref>\n\nThe number of schools and students grew apace with the taxpayer-funded public schools. In 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1.8 million pupils taught by 42,000 teachers, the great majority of whom were nuns. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation.<ref>David P. Baker, \"Schooling All the Masses: Reconsidering the Origins of American Schooling in the Postbellum Era,\" ''Sociology of Education'' (1999) 72#4 pp. 197-215 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673153 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nFor more than two generations, enrollment climbed steadily. By the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools. The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.<ref>Andrew M. Greeley, et al. ''Catholic Schools and a Declining Church'' (1976) ch 2</ref>\n\nA major transition took place in the 1970s as most of the teaching nuns left their orders. Many schools closed, others replaced the nuns with much better paid lay teachers and started charging higher tuition.<ref>Michael P. Caruso, ''When the Sisters Said Farewell: The Transition of Leadership in Catholic Elementary Schools'' (R&L Education, 2012)</ref><ref>United States Catholic Elementary and Secondary Schools, ''2009-2010: The Annual Statistical Report on Schools, Enrollment and Staffing'' (National Catholic Educational Association, 2010).</ref>\n\n===Polish Catholic parish schools===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Polish American catholic school language.jpg|thumb|right|169px|Catholic nun teaching the Polish language, Detroit. The phrase \"dzieci ida\" means \"children go\".]] -->\n\nPolish Americans arrived in large numbers, 1890\u20131914, concentrating in industrial and mining districts in the Northeast and Great Lakes areas. They often sent their children to parochial schools and encouraged their young women to become nuns and teachers.  In 1932 close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States.<ref>see [http://www.pchswi.org/archives/polish_heritage/soroka/soroka_pages_59_60.htm pp 59-60]</ref> Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college.\n\nIn Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes.<ref>Thomas I. Monzell, \"The Catholic Church and the Americanization of the Polish Immigrant,\" ''Polish American Studies'' (1969) 26#1 pp. 1-15 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20147794 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Supreme Court upholds parochial schools===\n{{Further|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\nIn 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an [[initiative]] amending [[Oregon Revised Statutes|Oregon Law]] Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act. The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law. The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"<ref>Thomas J. Shelley, \"The Oregon School Case and the National Catholic Welfare Conference.\" ''Catholic Historical Review'' (1989) 75#3 pp: 439-457. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25023087 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Blaine amendments==\n{{Main|Blaine Amendments}}\nIn 1875, Republican President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public funds for \"sectarian\" schools. He said he feared a future with \"patriotism and intelligence on one side and superstition, ambition and greed on the other\" which he identified with the Catholic Church. Grant called for public schools that would be \"unmixed with atheistic, pagan or sectarian teaching.\"<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Ulysses S. Grant, Politician'' (New York, 1935), pp.\n377-378</ref>\n\nA leading republican, Senator [[James G. Blaine]] of Maine had proposed such an amendment to the Constitution in 1874.<ref>Sister Marie Carolyn Klinkhamer, \"The Blaine Amendment of 1875: Private Motives for Political Action.\" ''Catholic Historical Review'' (1956): 15-49.</ref>  The amendment was turned down by Congress in 1875 and never became federal law. However, it would be used as a model for so-called \"Blaine Amendments\" incorporated into 34 state constitutions over the next three decades. These amendments prohibited the use of public funds to fund parochial schools and are still in effect today.<ref>Steven K.

Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason.<ref>Kathleen A. Mahoney, ''Catholic higher education in Protestant America: The Jesuits and Harvard in the age of the university'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe university was still a small operation best known for football when Rev [[Theodore Hesburgh]] took over and served as president for 35 years (1952\u201387). In that time the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6 million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million, and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.<ref>Michael O'Brien, ''Hesburgh: A Biography'' (1998); Theodore M.

It supported local schools, often under Jesuit auspices. The small Catholic Spanish communities in New Mexico and California, which joined the United States in 1848, had little in the way of organized schooling.\n\nMuch more important were schools of New Orleans, under Spanish and French control until 1803. Well-to-do families sent their children to private Catholic schools run by Ursulines and other orders of nuns. The Sisters of the Holy Family brought literacy and training in job skills to both free and enslaved black girls.<ref>Donna Porche-Frilot and Petra Munro Hendry, \"'Whatever Diversity of Shade May Appear': Catholic Women Religious Educators in Louisiana, 1727-1862,\" ''Catholic Southwest'' (2010) 21: 34-62.</ref>  The earliest continually operating school for girls in the United States is [[Ursuline Academy (New Orleans)|Ursuline Academy]] in [[New Orleans]]. It was founded in 1727 by the [[Ursulines|Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula]]. The Academy graduated the first female pharmacist, and the first woman to contribute a book of literary merit. It contained the first convent. It was the first free school and first retreat center for ladies, and first classes for female African-American slaves, free women of color, and Native Americans. In the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley, Ursulines provided the first center of social welfare in the Mississippi Valley, first boarding school in Louisiana and the first school of music in New Orleans.<ref>Robenstine Clark, \"French Colonial Policy and the Education of Women and Minorities: Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth Century,\" ''History of Education Quarterly'' (1992) 32#2 pp. 193-211 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/368985 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Parochial schools==\nAs the nation was mostly Protestant in the 19th century, there was anti-Catholic sentiment related to heavy immigration from Catholic Ireland after the 1840s, and a feeling that Catholic children should be educated in public schools to become American. In the 1880s most states passed a constitutional amendment, called [[Blaine Amendments]], forbidding tax money be used to fund [[parochial schools]], which affected also Lutherans and other denominations that operated schools.  By 1890 the Irish, who controlled the Church in the U.S., had built an extensive network of parishes and parish schools (\"parochial schools\") across the urban Northeast and Midwest. The Irish and other Catholic ethnic groups looked to parochial schools not only to protect their religion, but to enhance their culture and language.<ref>Timothy Walch, ''Parish School: American Catholic Parochial Education From Colonial Times to the Present'' (2003)</ref><ref>James J. Hennesey, ''American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States'' (1983)  p 172</ref>\n\nThe main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by [[Blaine Amendments|strong opposition to any public funding]] of parochial schools.<ref>Thomas E. Buckley, \"A Mandate for Anti-Catholicism: The Blaine Amendment,\" ''America'' 27 September 2004, 18\u201321.</ref>   The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers. In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the [[National Catholic Educational Association|Catholic Educational Association]] which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 262-74</ref> \n \nIn the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior conditions compared to the public schools, and fewer well-trained teachers.<ref>Jay P. Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) pp 286-91</ref><ref>James W. Sanders, ''The Education of an urban Minority: Catholics in Chicago, 1833\u20131965'' (Oxford University Press, 1977).</ref>\n\nThe number of schools and students grew apace with the taxpayer-funded public schools. In 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1.8 million pupils taught by 42,000 teachers, the great majority of whom were nuns. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation.<ref>David P. Baker, \"Schooling All the Masses: Reconsidering the Origins of American Schooling in the Postbellum Era,\" ''Sociology of Education'' (1999) 72#4 pp. 197-215 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673153 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nFor more than two generations, enrollment climbed steadily. By the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools. The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.<ref>Andrew M. Greeley, et al. ''Catholic Schools and a Declining Church'' (1976) ch 2</ref>\n\nA major transition took place in the 1970s as most of the teaching nuns left their orders. Many schools closed, others replaced the nuns with much better paid lay teachers and started charging higher tuition.<ref>Michael P. Caruso, ''When the Sisters Said Farewell: The Transition of Leadership in Catholic Elementary Schools'' (R&L Education, 2012)</ref><ref>United States Catholic Elementary and Secondary Schools, ''2009-2010: The Annual Statistical Report on Schools, Enrollment and Staffing'' (National Catholic Educational Association, 2010).</ref>\n\n===Polish Catholic parish schools===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Polish American catholic school language.jpg|thumb|right|169px|Catholic nun teaching the Polish language, Detroit. The phrase \"dzieci ida\" means \"children go\".]] -->\n\nPolish Americans arrived in large numbers, 1890-1914, concentrating in industrial and mining districts in the Northeast and Great Lakes areas. They often sent their children to parochial schools and encouraged their young women to become nuns and teachers.  In 1932 close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States.<ref>see [http://www.pchswi.org/archives/polish_heritage/soroka/soroka_pages_59_60.htm pp 59-60]</ref> Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college.\n\nIn Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes.<ref>Thomas I.

The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law. The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]] (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"<ref>Thomas J.

Grant]] called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public funds for \"sectarian\" schools. He said he feared a future with \"patriotism and intelligence on one side and superstition, ambition and greed on the other\" which he identified with the Catholic Church. Grant called for public schools that would be \"unmixed with atheistic, pagan or sectarian teaching.\"<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Ulysses S. Grant, Politician'' (New York, 1935), pp.\n377-378</ref>\n\nA leading republican, Senator [[James G.

However, it would be used as a model for so-called \"Blaine Amendments\" incorporated into 34 state constitutions over the next three decades. These amendments prohibited the use of public funds to fund parochial schools and are still in effect today.<ref>Steven K.

Animation]] for [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]. It is the thirteenth installment produced in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise. The series is produced by [[Chris Bailey (animator)|Chris Bailey]].\n\nThe show premiered on the [[Boomerang (TV network)#Mobile app/subscription service|Boomerang streaming service and app]] on June 27, 2019.<ref name=animationmagazine2>{{cite news|date=2018-05-23|title=Boomerang Unveils New SCOOBY-DOO AND GUESS WHO? & YABBA-DABBA DINOSAURS!

The show is rated TV-PG, making this the first ''Scooby-Doo'' series to carry that rating.\n\n==Premise==\n''Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?'' focuses on the Mystery Inc. gang as they solve mysteries while also encountering many memorable celebrities, similar in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. Guest stars that have appeared include [[Chris Paul]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Bill Nye]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] and [[Mark Hamill]], along with characters such as [[Steve Urkel]], [[Batman]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Magilla Gorilla]] and Mr. Peebles, and [[The Funky Phantom]].\n\nUnlike in The New Scooby-Doo Movies, the show is intended for a 30-minute block on TV instead of a 60-minute block and includes somewhat of a parody of the guest stars.\n\nThe tone of the show is comedic and does not include an overarching plot. The animation style is new to the Scooby-Doo franchise but is designed to look similar to how cartoons were drawn in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Scooby-Doo characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Frank Welker]] - [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] - [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] - [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]]\n* [[Kate Micucci]] - [[Velma Dinkley]]\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] - [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\")<ref name=Insta>{{cite news|date=2018-05-25|title=Matthew Lillard on Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvgDwpj5DY|work=Instagram }}</ref>\n* [[Ian James Corlett]] - [[Sherlock Holmes]] (in \"Elementary, My Dear Shaggy!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[John DiMaggio]] - [[Abraham Lincoln]] (in \"A Mystery Solving Gang Divided\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-scooby-doo-guess-who-trailer-20190620-story.html|title=New \u2018Scooby Doo\u2019 trailer turns Chris Paul, Sia and Wonder Woman into cartoons|date=June 20, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] - Himself (in \"The Fastest Food Fiend!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] - Himself (in \"Ollie Ollie In-Come Free!\")\n<!--* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] - Herself<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/788081/scooby-doo-and-guess-who-boomerang-premiere/</ref> (in \"The Nightmare Ghost of Psychic U!\")>-->\n<!--* [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] - Herself>-->\n* [[Mark Hamill]] - [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\"), Himself\n* [[Rachel Kimsey]] - [[Wonder Woman]] (in \"The Scooby of a Thousand Faces!\")<ref name=FutonCritic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/20/jinkies-new-series-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-to-world-premiere-on-boomerang-583304/20190620boomerang01/|title=Breaking News - Jinkies!

Animation]] for [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]. It is the thirteenth installment produced in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise. The series is produced by [[Chris Bailey (animator)|Chris Bailey]].\n\nThe show premiered on the [[Boomerang (TV network)#Mobile app/subscription service|Boomerang streaming service and app]] on June 27, 2019.<ref name=animationmagazine2>{{cite news|date=2018-05-23|title=Boomerang Unveils New SCOOBY-DOO AND GUESS WHO? & YABBA-DABBA DINOSAURS!

The show is rated TV-PG, making this the first ''Scooby-Doo'' series to carry that rating.\n\n==Premise==\n''Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?'' focuses on the Mystery Inc. gang as they solve mysteries while also encountering many memorable celebrities, similar in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. Guest stars that have appeared include [[Chris Paul]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Bill Nye]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] and [[Mark Hamill]], along with characters such as [[Steve Urkel]], [[Batman]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Magilla Gorilla]] and Mr. Peebles, and [[The Funky Phantom]].\n\nUnlike in The New Scooby-Doo Movies, the show is intended for a 30-minute block on TV instead of a 60-minute block and includes somewhat of a parody of the guest stars.\n\nThe tone of the show is comedic and does not include an overarching plot. The animation style is new to the Scooby-Doo franchise but is designed to look similar to how cartoons were drawn in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Scooby-Doo characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Frank Welker]] - [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] - [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] - [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]]\n* [[Kate Micucci]] - [[Velma Dinkley]]\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] - [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\")<ref name=Insta>{{cite news|date=2018-05-25|title=Matthew Lillard on Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvgDwpj5DY|work=Instagram }}</ref>\n* [[Ian James Corlett]] - [[Sherlock Holmes]] (in \"Elementary, My Dear Shaggy!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[John DiMaggio]] - [[Abraham Lincoln]] (in \"A Mystery Solving Gang Divided\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-scooby-doo-guess-who-trailer-20190620-story.html|title=New \u2018Scooby Doo\u2019 trailer turns Chris Paul, Sia and Wonder Woman into cartoons|date=June 20, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] - Himself (in \"The Fastest Food Fiend!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] - Himself (in \"Ollie Ollie In-Come Free!\")\n<!--* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] - Herself<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/788081/scooby-doo-and-guess-who-boomerang-premiere/</ref> (in \"The Nightmare Ghost of Psychic U!\")>-->\n<!--* [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] - Herself>-->\n* [[Mark Hamill]] - [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\"), Himself\n* [[Rachel Kimsey]] - [[Wonder Woman]] (in \"The Scooby of a Thousand Faces!\")<ref name=FutonCritic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/20/jinkies-new-series-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-to-world-premiere-on-boomerang-583304/20190620boomerang01/|title=Breaking News - Jinkies!
