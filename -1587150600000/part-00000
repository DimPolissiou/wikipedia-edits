Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] with a [[primordial dwarfism]] condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the [[action film]] [[Parody film|spoof]] ''Agent OO'' (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. \n\n''Agent OO's'' sequel ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) that launched dela Cruz to brief but international stardom but also made him a unique figure in [[Cinematography|cinema]]. After it's local release, first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign [[Film distributor|distributor]]. At the high profile event, ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough star. \n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. Eventually Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon. Online, some of his movies and clips of them went viral. By the 2000s, a lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

At dela Cruz's funeral Celing said that Peter paid for the casket paid and sent a minor amount of cash, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Rez Cortez, Nelson Anderson, Roland Dantes, Franco Guerrero, Rusty Santos, and Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz appalling. For dela Cruz, Nicart said the Caballes provided shelter, care, travelled the world, while under paid at $ 500 per films with a per diem. Nicart said the Caballes were wealthy and treated dela Cruz like a dog. They would be friendly to him, but would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting or when inconvenient. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes were too possessive not allowing him to grow and think for himself.<ref name=\":6\" /> Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing, he suspected that dela Cruz wasn't well compensated. Cortez knew dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, but found it strange when he saw dela Cruz arrive on set in a utility vehicle and not his private car. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' when they tracked down the couple to get their account, Peter had passed away in 2007 while Cora never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, a former actor and stuntman, had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film due to his limitations and also his inability to read a script. Prior to the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) and for the rest of dela Cruz's career Nicart trained him with the stunt company SOS Daredevils. To further dela Cruz's abilities, they gave him acting, karate, fight choreography, and stunts lessons. Nicart found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his sense of humor and physical skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nDela Cruz had several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends and dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson wanting to be prudent, said de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and a helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. Also, a man once tapped his hand on his head, provoked dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, they separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref name=\":6\" /> Catral stated she had affection for dela Cruz, as well as the only individual worthwhile  to hang out with inset, and when she stopped acting to finish her studies she only said goodbye to dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Celing said that fellow actress [[Lotis Key]] attended dela Cruz's funeral.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] with a [[primordial dwarfism]] condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the [[action film]] [[Parody film|spoof]] ''Agent OO'' (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. \n\n''Agent OO's'' sequel ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) that launched dela Cruz to brief but international stardom but also made him a unique figure in [[Cinematography|cinema]]. After it's local release, first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign [[Film distributor|distributor]]. At the high profile event, ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough star. \n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. Eventually Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

Gradually Weng Weng once again found an audience with his works being viewed by millions. Around this time director Andrew Leavold decided to make a documentary about the life of Weng Weng. The discoveries on Weng Weng led to two theatrically released documentaries. First it inspired [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010) which focuses on the history of films made in the Philippines during Weng Weng's active years where he had a segment dedicated to him among his contemporaries. The second one about his life, ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013), was directed by Leavold, who also followed it up with a book by the same name, on details that didn't make the final cut or discovered later. Both films were prominent on festival circuits and critically acclaimed.<ref>{{Citation|title=Machete Maidens Unleashed!

Dela Cruz was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The official cause is heart attack due to hypertension.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Personal ==\nCeling and Filipino actor Franco Guerrero said that dela Cruz never had any romantic relationships. Guerrero said that dela Cruz said he would brag about sexual exploit but never saw his actual girlfriends. Director Dante Pangilinan said that dela Cruz had his first kiss on the set of ''Sila... Sa bawat bangketa'' (1977) after he asked him if he could get an onscreen kiss. When he said yes, dela Cruz was both delighted and nervous. Yehlen Catral, who played the damsel-in-distress in a dela Cruz film, said she helped him introduce himself to women.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=219-239|chapter=An interview with Yehlen Catral}}</ref> According to director Eddie Nicart if dela Cruz would get free from the set, he would immediately go where there is drinks and women, and would consistently ask their whereabouts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Actors [[Rez Cortez]] and [[Roland Dantes]] also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and had adult conversations with him, but had an odd sense of humor, and thinks it is probably what led others to believe he was slow.<ref name=\":5\" />  Actor Nelson Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side to his talent.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref>\n\nProducer Peter and Cora Caballes were married when they discovered dela Cruz. During dela Cruz's prime, their account was that they adopted him ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. In 1982 they released their last film with dela Cruz. According to both Nicart and film distributor John Kater, the couple separated. Peter left Manilla and Cora ran successfully as a [[City council|city councilor]]. \n\nCeling denies Peter and Cora Caballes's account on his adoption and said they just borrowed dela Cruz when needed, as if he would go on a holiday with them. Celing describes the couple as civil when visiting, but only dealt with their mother on business issues and promised her a house. Celing added that they never provided it or fully pay his brother, they abandoned him when they had a career change, and completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed. At dela Cruz's funeral Celing said that Peter paid for the casket paid and sent a minor amount of cash, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Rez Cortez, Nelson Anderson, Roland Dantes, Franco Guerrero, Rusty Santos, and Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz appalling. For dela Cruz, Nicart said the Caballes provided shelter, care, travelled the world, while under paid at $ 500 per films with a per diem. Nicart said the Caballes were wealthy and treated dela Cruz like a dog. They would be friendly to him, but would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting or when inconvenient. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes were too possessive not allowing him to grow and think for himself.<ref name=\":6\" /> Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing, he suspected that dela Cruz wasn't well compensated. Cortez knew dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, but found it strange when he saw dela Cruz arrive on set in a utility vehicle and not his private car. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' when they tracked down the couple to get their account, Peter had passed away in 2007 while Cora never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, a former actor and stuntman, had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film due to his limitations and also his inability to read a script. Prior to the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) and for the rest of dela Cruz's career Nicart trained him with the stunt company SOS Daredevils. To further dela Cruz's abilities, they gave him acting, karate, fight choreography, and stunts lessons. Nicart found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his sense of humor and physical skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nDela Cruz had several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends and dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson wanting to be prudent, said de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and a helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. Also, a man once tapped his hand on his head, provoked dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, they separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref name=\":6\" /> Catral stated she had affection for dela Cruz, as well as the only individual worthwhile  to hang out with inset, and when she stopped acting to finish her studies she only said goodbye to dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Celing said that fellow actress [[Lotis Key]] attended dela Cruz's funeral.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

In 2010, [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' a documentary film that dealt with the Filipino movie exploitation craze of the 1970s and 1980s, paid a special homage to dela Cruz's movie career. The basis of the first film was the 2007 rough cut of Andrew Leavolds's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' released in 2013, about discovering dela Cruz's life.\n\nDela Cruz's real voice as rarely been heard outside of Philippines, since the original dubs of his films have never been available outside of his home country.\n\nDela Cruz is the first Filipino actor to have a documentary and a book written about him published in western countries.\n\nAcademic Dr. [[Tilman Baumg\u00e4rtel]] expressed discomfort watching Weng Weng films saying they are pre-modern, reminding him of the Medieval times where royalties would have a handicap, a dwarf act as a jester, and would be already funny based on that.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz's image is very controversial within Philippines' local film industry, with some auteur cineaste an academic feeling that it is an uncomfortable image of the country, especially at a time where they had no international figures.

When dela Cruz trained with him with the stuntmen's organisation SOS Daredevils, like everyone else he had to start back in Karate from white belt and gradually go to black, while teaching dela Cruz how to jump and perform stunts from tall heights.

An arrogant driver of a luxury car on the way to the top of a hill refuses to help them, but then the driver is killed from a car explosion.

|Summary         = Serena's [[Jirokichi Suzuki (Case Closed)|uncle Jirokichi]] challenges the [[Kaito Kid]] to steal a pair of jeweled shoes called the Purple Nails in the center of a city intersection. When Kid arrives, nets cover the intersection seemingly trapping him, but Kid proclaims that he can teleport, and he soon disappears and reappears on a roof top. Since one of the shoes was a fake, he and Jirokichi arrange another challenge. [[Conan Edogawa]] tries to determine how Kid is able to move so quickly. The [[Detective Boys|Junior Detective League]] and [[Dr. Agasa]] are on a road trip when their car runs out of gas. An arrogant driver of a luxury car on the way to the top of a hill refuses to help them, but then the driver is killed from a car explosion. His fiancee believes it was because he had lit up a cigarette in a gasoline-filled garage, but Conan suspects foul play. In another case, Conan and [[List of Case Closed characters#Okiya Subaru|Subaru Okiya]], a grad student who is living at Jimmy's place, try to deduce what is going on with a bunch of [[paper airplane]]s with peculiar markings that have appeared around town. They find it is a code by someone who had been abducted, and, with Rachel's help, scramble to find the person as the kidnapper had apparently committed suicide. The brother of Cafe Poirot's waitress Azusa becomes a suspect in a murder case, but Azusa reacts strangely to the news and then runs off in response to a package she received.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n |SublistOf= List of Case Closed volumes\n |VolumeNumber    = 62\n |LicensedTitle=The Kudo Identity\n |OriginalRelDate = August 11, 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skygarden.shogakukan.co.jp/skygarden/owa/solc_dtl?isbn=9784091214645|title=Detective Conan Vol 62|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n |OriginalISBN    = 978-4-09-121464-5\n |LicensedRelDate = April 11, 2017<ref>http://www.viz.com/read/manga/case-closed-vol-62/12307</ref>\n |LicensedISBN    = 978-1-4215-8685-4\n |ChapterList     = <!-- Viz titles -->\n{{numbered list|start=642\n|{{nihongo|\"False Friendship\"|\u507d\u308a\u306e\u53cb\u60c5|\"Itsuwari no Y\u016bj\u014d\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Wings of Icarus\"|\u30a4\u30ab\u30ed\u30b9\u306e\u7ffc|\"Ikarosu no Tsubasa\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Counterattack\"|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|\"Kaeshi Waza\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Lucky Chance\"|\u30b1\u30ac\u306e\u529f\u540d|\"Kega no K\u014dmy\u014d\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Village of Hatred\"|\u618e\u60aa\u306e\u6751|\"Z\u014do no Mura\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Lost Memory\"|\u5931\u308f\u308c\u305f\u8a18\u61b6|\"Ushinawareta Kioku\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Jimmy Kudo's Murder\"|\u5de5\u85e4\u65b0\u4e00\u306e\u6bba\u4eba|\"Kud\u014d Shinichi no Satsujin\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Shiragami\"|\u6b7b\u7f85\u795e\u69d8|\"Shiragami-sama\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Endless Tears\"|\u6b62\u307e\u3089\u306c\u6d99|\"Tomaranu Namida\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"True Identity\"|\u6b63\u4f53|\"Sh\u014dtai\"}}\n|{{nihongo|\"What I Really Want to Ask\"|\u30db\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u805e\u304d\u305f\u3044\u30b3\u30c8|\"Honto ni Kikitai Koto\"}}\n}}\n |Summary         = Conan helps Meguire, Richard and the detectives identify the real killer behind the murder of Azusa's brother's boss.

Before Good's work, few hydrogen ion buffers between pH 6 and 8 had been accessible to biologists, and very inappropriate, toxic, reactive and inefficient buffers had often been used. Many Good's buffers became and remain crucial tools in modern biological laboratories.\n\n==Selection criteria==\nGood sought to identify buffering compounds which met several criteria likely to be of value in biological research.\n\n#[[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]]:  Because most biological reactions take place near-neutral [[pH]] between 6 and 8, ideal buffers would have p''K''<sub>a</sub> values in this region to provide maximum buffering capacity there.\n#Solubility:  For ease in handling and because biological systems are in aqueous systems, good solubility in water was required.  Low solubility in [[nonpolarity|nonpolar]] solvents (fats, oils, and organic solvents) was also considered beneficial, as this would tend to prevent the buffer compound from accumulating in nonpolar compartments in biological systems: [[cell membrane]]s and other cell compartments.\n#Membrane impermeability:  Ideally, a buffer will not readily pass through cell membranes, this will also reduce the accumulation of buffer compound within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.\n#Minimal salt effects:  Highly ionic buffers may cause problems or complications in some biological systems.\n#Influences on dissociation:  There should be a minimum influence of buffer concentration, temperature, and ionic composition of the medium on the dissociation of the buffer.\n#Well-behaved cation interactions:  If the buffers form [[complex (chemistry)|complex]]es with [[cation]]ic [[ligand]]s, the complexes formed should remain soluble.  Ideally, at least some of the buffering compounds will not form complexes.\n#Stability:  The buffers should be chemically stable, resisting [[enzyme|enzymatic]] and non-enzymatic degradation.\n#Biochemical inertness: The buffers should not influence or participate in any biochemical reactions.\n#Optical absorbance:  Buffers should not absorb visible or [[ultraviolet]] light at wavelengths longer than 230 [[nanometer|nm]] so as not to interfere with commonly used [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] assays.\n#Ease of preparation:  Buffers should be easily prepared and purified from inexpensive materials.\n\n==List of Good's buffers==\nThe Good's buffers are presented in the table below. The table presents \u201capparent\u201d p''K''<sub>a</sub>s measured by Good's group at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and concentrations of about 100&nbsp;mM. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the buffer's pH when the concentrations of two buffering species are equal, and the buffer solution has the maximum buffering capacity. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub>, and therefore the pH, of any buffer are temperature and concentration dependent. Consequently, the pH of prepared concentrated buffer solutions will change on dilution and with temperature. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> at various concentrations and temperatures may be predicted using online calculators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Biological buffers |url=http://www.reachdevices.com/Protein/BiologicalBuffers.html |publisher=REACH Devices}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

No one buffer is truly and completely inert in biological systems. In Good's own words, \"it may be that the quest for universal biological inertness is futile.\"\nOnly three of Good's buffers do not form noticeable complexes with any metals: [[MES (buffer)|MES]], [[MOPS]] and [[PIPES]]. Piperazine-containing buffers ([[PIPES]], [[HEPES]], [[POPSO]] and [[HEPPS (molecule)|EPPS]]) can form radicals and should be avoided in studies of redox processes in biochemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1988|last1=Grady|first1=J.

Before Good's work, few hydrogen ion buffers between pH 6 and 8 had been accessible to biologists, and very inappropriate, toxic, reactive and inefficient buffers had often been used. Many Good's buffers became and remain crucial tools in modern biological laboratories.\n\n==Selection criteria==\nGood sought to identify buffering compounds which met several criteria likely to be of value in biological research.\n\n#[[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]]:  Because most biological reactions take place near-neutral [[pH]] between 6 and 8, ideal buffers would have p''K''<sub>a</sub> values in this region to provide maximum buffering capacity there.\n#Solubility:  For ease in handling and because biological systems are in aqueous systems, good solubility in water was required.  Low solubility in [[nonpolarity|nonpolar]] solvents (fats, oils, and organic solvents) was also considered beneficial, as this would tend to prevent the buffer compound from accumulating in nonpolar compartments in biological systems: [[cell membrane]]s and other cell compartments.\n#Membrane impermeability:  Ideally, a buffer will not readily pass through cell membranes, this will also reduce the accumulation of buffer compound within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.\n#Minimal salt effects:  Highly ionic buffers may cause problems or complications in some biological systems.\n#Influences on dissociation:  There should be a minimum influence of buffer concentration, temperature, and ionic composition of the medium on the dissociation of the buffer.\n#Well-behaved cation interactions:  If the buffers form [[complex (chemistry)|complex]]es with [[cation]]ic [[ligand]]s, the complexes formed should remain soluble.  Ideally, at least some of the buffering compounds will not form complexes.\n#Stability:  The buffers should be chemically stable, resisting [[enzyme|enzymatic]] and non-enzymatic degradation.\n#Biochemical inertness: The buffers should not influence or participate in any biochemical reactions.\n#Optical absorbance:  Buffers should not absorb visible or [[ultraviolet]] light at wavelengths longer than 230 [[nanometer|nm]] so as not to interfere with commonly used [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] assays.\n#Ease of preparation:  Buffers should be easily prepared and purified from inexpensive materials.\n\n==List of Good's buffers==\nThe Good's buffers are presented in the table below. The table presents \u201capparent\u201d p''K''<sub>a</sub>s measured by Good's group at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and concentrations of about 100&nbsp;mM. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the buffer's pH when the concentrations of two buffering species are equal, and the buffer solution has the maximum buffering capacity. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub>, and therefore the pH, of any buffer are temperature and concentration dependent. Consequently, the pH of prepared concentrated buffer solutions will change on dilution and with temperature. The apparent p''K''<sub>a</sub> at various concentrations and temperatures may be predicted using online calculators.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Biological buffers |url=http://www.reachdevices.com/Protein/BiologicalBuffers.html |publisher=REACH Devices}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

No one buffer is truly and completely inert in biological systems. In Good's own words, \"it may be that the quest for universal biological inertness is futile.\"\nOnly three of Good's buffers do not form noticeable complexes with any metals: [[MES (buffer)|MES]], [[MOPS]] and [[PIPES]].

The film follows the Brody children from the previous films at [[SeaWorld Orlando|SeaWorld]], a Florida marine park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young [[great white shark]] infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly attacking and killing the park's employees. Once the shark is captured, however, it becomes apparent that a second, much larger shark that also entered the park was the real culprit.\n\nThe film made use of [[3D film|3D]] during the revived interest in the technology in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]''.

A fourth film, ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'', followed in 1987.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nWhile following an unsuspecting team of water skiers, a [[great white shark]] enters [[SeaWorld Orlando]] through its closing gates. Meanwhile, Florida announces the opening of the park's new underwater tunnels. Kathryn \"Kay\" Morgan, the park's senior marine biologist, and her assistants notice that the resident dolphins are afraid of leaving their pen. Shelby Overman, a mechanic, dives into the water to repair and secure the gates. He is attacked by the shark and killed, leaving only his severed right arm. Later that night, two men sneak into the park and go underwater to steal [[coral]] they intend to [[Black Market|sell]], but both are killed by the shark in the process.\n\nThe next day, Kay and Michael Brody are informed of Overman's disappearance. They go down in a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a smaller shark. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but the shark escapes back into the park. They inform Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, and it excites his hunter friend, Phillip FitzRoyce, who states his intention to kill the shark on network television. Kay protests and suggests capturing and keeping the shark alive in captivity, to guarantee more publicity for the park. The shark is successfully captured, and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies.\n\nLater, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay realizes that the shark that killed him is the first shark's {{convert|35|foot|meters}} long mother and that it must also be inside the park. She is able to convince Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but his tether rope suddenly snaps and is then attacked and killed.\n\nHearing that the shark has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay go down to repair the underwater tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump to be shut down to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows it to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are again saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears in front of the window and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their battle with the shark.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as Mike Brody\n*[[Bess Armstrong]] as Kathryn Morgan\n*[[Simon MacCorkindale]] as Philip FitzRoyce\n*[[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Calvin Bouchard\n*[[John Putch]] as Sean Brody\n*[[Lea Thompson]] as Kelly Ann Bukowski\n*[[P.

Lerner said that his \"heart sank\" when he was sent the first script of ''Jaws 3-D'', saying, \"I can't really get involved in this\".

''Jaws''{{'s}} second sequel integrated the technology into its title, as did ''[[Amityville 3D]]''. ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' could also make dual use of the number three.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{harvnb|McGee|2001|pp=97\u20138}}</ref> The gimmick was also advertised in the tagline \"the third dimension is terror.\"<ref name=\"Saxelid\"/> As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, he thought that 3D would \"give him an edge\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/>\n\n[[File:Jaws 3 - shark explosion - 3-D effect.jpg|thumb|An example of the film's use of [[3D film|3D]]; the shark's jaws coming toward the viewer after its destruction.]]\nCinema audiences could wear disposable [[polarized glasses]] to view the film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying to the forefront of the screen, leaving a [[Doppler effect|trail]]. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the blue screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.<ref name=\"Zone\"/>\n\n''Jaws 3-D'' had two 3D consultants: the production started with [[Chris Condon]], president of StereoVision,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=American cinematographer, Volume 66 |author=American Society of Cinematographers |page=85 |publisher=ASC Holding Corp. |year=1985 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> and Stan Loth was later added to the team for the ArriVision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after a week for the ArriVision system, \"which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/> According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that \"the left and right images [in ''Jaws 3-D''] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache.\"<ref name=\"McGee\"/><ref>The Alves quote in {{harvnb|McGee|2001}} originally appeared in Thornshaw, Brian \"Joe Alves and Jaws 3D\", ''Fangoria'', 1, 29</ref> Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units.<ref name=\"hayes\">{{harvnb|Hayes|1998|pp=101\u20133}}</ref> Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35&nbsp;mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half, a technique known as \"over/under\". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarized 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation\u2009\u2060\u2014\u2009something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective \"silver\" screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for ''Jaws 3-D'', the underwater sequences were shot using an [[Arriflex]] 35\u20133 camera with Arrivision 18&nbsp;mm over/under 3D lens.<ref name=\"Ankeney\"/>\n\nThis kind of 3D effect does not work on television without special electronic hardware at the viewer's end, and so with two exceptions, the home video and broadcast TV versions of ''Jaws 3-D'' were created using just the left-eye image, and with the title changed to ''Jaws 3'' or ''Jaws III''. Because the left-eye image only takes up half the 35&nbsp;mm film frame, the picture resolution is noticeably poorer than would normally be expected of a film shot on 35&nbsp;mm.\n\nOne of the exceptions was a 1986 release of the film for the now-obsolete [[Video High Density]] (VHD) video disc system. This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarized 3D effect to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disclord.tripod.com/vhddiscworld/id1.html|title=3D Compatible Video|website=disclord.tripod.com|accessdate=January 3, 2007}}</ref> The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of ''Jaws 3-D'' released in February 2008.

The film follows the Brody children from the previous films at [[SeaWorld Orlando|SeaWorld]], a Florida marine park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young [[great white shark]] infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly attacking and killing the park's employees. Once the shark is captured, however, it becomes apparent that a second, much larger shark that also entered the park was the real culprit.\n\nThe film made use of [[3D film|3D]] during the revived interest in the technology in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]''.

Meanwhile, Florida announces the opening of the park's new underwater tunnels. Kathryn \"Kay\" Morgan, the park's senior marine biologist, and her assistants notice that the resident dolphins are afraid of leaving their pen. Shelby Overman, a mechanic, dives into the water to repair and secure the gates. He is attacked by the shark and killed, leaving only his severed right arm. Later that night, two men sneak into the park and go underwater to steal [[coral]] they intend to [[Black Market|sell]], but both are killed by the shark in the process.\n\nThe next day, Kay and Michael Brody are informed of Overman's disappearance. They go down in a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a smaller shark. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but the shark escapes back into the park. They inform Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, and it excites his hunter friend, Phillip FitzRoyce, who states his intention to kill the shark on network television. Kay protests and suggests capturing and keeping the shark alive in captivity, to guarantee more publicity for the park. The shark is successfully captured, and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies.\n\nLater, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay realizes that the shark that killed him is the first shark's {{convert|35|foot|meters}} long mother and that it must also be inside the park. She is able to convince Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but his tether rope suddenly snaps and is then attacked and killed.\n\nHearing that the shark has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay go down to repair the underwater tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump to be shut down to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows it to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are again saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears in front of the window and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their battle with the shark.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as Mike Brody\n*[[Bess Armstrong]] as Kathryn Morgan\n*[[Simon MacCorkindale]] as Philip FitzRoyce\n*[[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Calvin Bouchard\n*[[John Putch]] as Sean Brody\n*[[Lea Thompson]] as Kelly Ann Bukowski\n*[[P.

Lerner said that his \"heart sank\" when he was sent the first script of ''Jaws 3-D'', saying, \"I can't really get involved in this\". As the production already had an art director, Lerner, who didn't like the script, declined to be involved in the film.<ref name=\"Zone\"/>\n\nThe film was directed by Joe Alves, who was the [[production designer]] for the first two films and was the [[second unit director]] for ''Jaws 2''. It had been suggested that Alves co-direct the first sequel with [[Verna Fields]] when first director [[John D.

[[Richard Matheson]], who had written the script for [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'', says that he wrote a \"very interesting\" outline, although the story is credited to \"some other writer\".<ref name=\"matheson\">{{harvnb|Weaver|2006|p=318}}</ref> Universal forced Matheson to include Brody's two sons, which the writer \"thought was dumb\".

''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' could also make dual use of the number three.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{harvnb|McGee|2001|pp=97\u20138}}</ref> The gimmick was also advertised in the tagline \"the third dimension is terror.\"<ref name=\"Saxelid\"/> As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, he thought that 3D would \"give him an edge\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/>\n\n[[File:Jaws 3 - shark explosion - 3-D effect.jpg|thumb|An example of the film's use of [[3D film|3D]]; the shark's jaws coming toward the viewer after its destruction.]]\nCinema audiences could wear disposable [[polarized glasses]] to view the film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying to the forefront of the screen, leaving a [[Doppler effect|trail]]. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the blue screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.<ref name=\"Zone\"/>\n\n''Jaws 3-D'' had two 3D consultants: the production started with [[Chris Condon]], president of StereoVision,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=American cinematographer, Volume 66 |author=American Society of Cinematographers |page=85 |publisher=ASC Holding Corp. |year=1985 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> and Stan Loth was later added to the team for the ArriVision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after a week for the ArriVision system, \"which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/> According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that \"the left and right images [in ''Jaws 3-D''] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache.\"<ref name=\"McGee\"/><ref>The Alves quote in {{harvnb|McGee|2001}} originally appeared in Thornshaw, Brian \"Joe Alves and Jaws 3D\", ''Fangoria'', 1, 29</ref> Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units.<ref name=\"hayes\">{{harvnb|Hayes|1998|pp=101\u20133}}</ref> Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35&nbsp;mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half, a technique known as \"over/under\". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarized 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation\u2009\u2060\u2014\u2009something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective \"silver\" screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for ''Jaws 3-D'', the underwater sequences were shot using an [[Arriflex]] 35\u20133 camera with Arrivision 18&nbsp;mm over/under 3D lens.<ref name=\"Ankeney\"/>\n\nThis kind of 3D effect does not work on television without special electronic hardware at the viewer's end, and so with two exceptions, the home video and broadcast TV versions of ''Jaws 3-D'' were created using just the left-eye image, and with the title changed to ''Jaws 3'' or ''Jaws III''. Because the left-eye image only takes up half the 35&nbsp;mm film frame, the picture resolution is noticeably poorer than would normally be expected of a film shot on 35&nbsp;mm.\n\nOne of the exceptions was a 1986 release of the film for the now-obsolete [[Video High Density]] (VHD) video disc system. This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarized 3D effect to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disclord.tripod.com/vhddiscworld/id1.html|title=3D Compatible Video|website=disclord.tripod.com|accessdate=January 3, 2007}}</ref> The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of ''Jaws 3-D'' released in February 2008.

From 1995 to [[1997 Michigan State Spartans football team|1997]], Michigan State finished 6\u20135\u20131, 6\u20136, and 7\u20135. In comparison, MSU had finished 5\u20136, 6\u20136, and 5\u20136 (prior to NCAA forfeits) in 1992\u20131994.\n\nOn November 7, [[1998 Michigan State Spartans football team|1998]], the Spartans upset the No.{{nbsp}}1 ranked [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] 28\u201324 at [[Ohio Stadium]]. However, even after the upset and an early-season rout of then-highly ranked Notre Dame the Spartans finished 6\u20136, including three last-minute losses featuring turnovers, defensive lapses, and special-teams misplays, and failed to earn a bowl invitation.\n\nSaban led the [[1999 Michigan State Spartans football team|1999 Spartans]] to a 9\u20132 season that included wins over [[1999 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], [[1999 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], [[1999 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], and [[1999 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]]. However, the two losses were routs at the hands of [[1999 Purdue Boilermakers football team|Purdue]] and [[1999 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]]. Following the final regular-season game against Penn State, Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Saban's assistant head coach and successor, [[Bobby Williams]], then coached the Spartans to a [[Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] victory over [[1999 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], giving the Spartans an overall record of 10\u20132 for the 1999 season.

After a loss to the [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] Rebels, the Tigers finished the year with six straight wins, including a win over #2 Tennessee in the [[2001 SEC Championship Game]], and a 47\u201334 win over [[2001 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] in the [[2002 Sugar Bowl]]. It was the first outright [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship for LSU since [[1986 LSU Tigers football team|1986]], and the first time the Tigers had won the Sugar Bowl since [[1968 LSU Tigers football team|1968]].\n\nThe [[2002 LSU Tigers football team|2002]] season opened with high expectations, but a 26\u20138 loss at the hands of [[2002 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] raised serious questions about their outlook. However, the Tigers would rebound to win their next six straight, but after a mid-season injury to quarterback [[Matt Mauck]], LSU lost four of its last six games to close the season, including a 21\u201320 loss at [[2002 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]], which knocked the Tigers out of the SEC Championship Game, and forced them to share the SEC West Division title with the Razorbacks. LSU also suffered a 35\u201320 loss to Texas in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], and finished 8\u20135.\n\nThe [[2003 LSU Tigers football team|2003]] Tigers started the season with five wins, including a 17\u201310 victory in [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] over the defending SEC champion, and then-undefeated, [[2003 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]].

Other losses that season were on the road at Auburn 10\u20139, and a loss on the road to Georgia 45\u201316. At the end of the [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004 season]], Saban left LSU to coach the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n\n===Miami yeeeeee Dolphins===\n\nSaban accepted the head coaching position for the [[Miami Dolphins]] on December 25, 2004. He was the sixth coach in the franchise's history. The Nick Saban era officially kicked off with a 34\u201310 win over the [[2005 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|2005]]. From there, however, the Dolphins struggled, losing seven of their next nine games to fall to 3\u20137. The two wins came over the [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], a game that took place in [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] due to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. After a frustrating two months, however, the Dolphins would rally late in the season, as they won their final six games, including a win to end the season in [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]] over the [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. The team finished the year with a 9\u20137 record, and narrowly missed the playoffs in Saban's first season.\n\nGoing into the [[2006 Miami Dolphins season|2006]] season, the Dolphins were expected to contend for a playoff spot. The season, however, turned out to be a major disappointment. The Dolphins were considering quarterback [[Drew Brees]], who had just been released from the [[San Diego Chargers]] due to a career-threatening shoulder injury and subsequent contract dispute, but instead signed [[Daunte Culpepper]], who was still recovering from a knee injury from the previous season. Culpepper never fully recovered and was ultimately benched after the fourth game of the season, when the Dolphins lost to the [[Houston Texans]]. He was eventually put on [[injured reserve]]. After starting the season 1\u20136, however, the Dolphins got hot. They won four straight games, including wins over the [[Chicago Bears]], who were previously unbeaten and made it to the [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] that year, and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Suddenly, the Dolphins were back in the playoff hunt at 5\u20136, but a 24\u201310 loss the following week to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] all but ended their playoff hopes. The Dolphins would rebound the following week with a 21\u20130 win over the [[New England Patriots]]. The win would be the last bright spot for the Dolphins in the 2006 season. Quarterback [[Joey Harrington]] was eventually benched in favor of third-string quarterback [[Cleo Lemon]]. While the defense was very good, the offense was anemic, with the only bright spot being running back [[Ronnie Brown]], who gained over 1,000 rushing yards on the season. The Dolphins would lose their next two games to the [[Buffalo Bills]] and the [[New York Jets]] to finish 6\u201310, Saban's first losing season as a head coach.\n\nOn November 27, 2006, the [[University of Alabama]] announced the firing of head coach [[Mike Shula]].

The game was tied 28\u201328 with only a single second remaining in regulation, as Alabama and Auburn appeared headed for overtime. Extra time wasn't necessary, however, as Saban decided to attempt a 56-yard field goal instead of either running out the clock or attempting a Hail Mary from Auburn's 39-yard line. The decision proved costly, as the field goal was short but caught nine yards deep in the Auburn end zone by the Tigers' [[Chris Davis (cornerback)|Chris Davis]], who returned the failed attempt [[Kick Bama Kick|109 yards for a touchdown]] as time expired. The 28\u201334 loss knocked Alabama out of contention for the SEC Championship and dashed The Tide's hope for a national championship. Alabama finished the regular season 11\u20131 for the third consecutive year and clinched a share with Auburn of the SEC West Division title. At the end of the regular season, Alabama finished ranked No.{{nbsp}}3 in the final BCS rankings and earned an at-large bid to the [[2014 Sugar Bowl]].

It was the first outright [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship for LSU since [[1986 LSU Tigers football team|1986]], and the first time the Tigers had won the Sugar Bowl since [[1968 LSU Tigers football team|1968]].\n\nThe [[2002 LSU Tigers football team|2002]] season opened with high expectations, but a 26\u20138 loss at the hands of [[2002 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] raised serious questions about their outlook. However, the Tigers would rebound to win their next six straight, but after a mid-season injury to quarterback [[Matt Mauck]], LSU lost four of its last six games to close the season, including a 21\u201320 loss at [[2002 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]], which knocked the Tigers out of the SEC Championship Game, and forced them to share the SEC West Division title with the Razorbacks. LSU also suffered a 35\u201320 loss to Texas in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]], and finished 8\u20135.\n\nThe [[2003 LSU Tigers football team|2003]] Tigers started the season with five wins, including a 17\u201310 victory in [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] over the defending SEC champion, and then-undefeated, [[2003 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]]. LSU lost the following week to [[2003 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], 19\u20137. After the loss to Florida, LSU did not lose again in the regular season and ended its regular season with a win over the [[2003 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas Razorbacks]] to win the [[Southeastern Conference#Current members|SEC West]]. After winning the SEC West, the Tigers defeated the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta. They were ranked No. 2 in the BCS standings and advanced to play the BCS No.{{nbsp}}1 [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] in the [[Sugar Bowl]], which was the host of the [[BCS Championship Game]] in 2003.

Other losses that season were on the road at Auburn 10\u20139, and a loss on the road to Georgia 45\u201316. At the end of the [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004 season]], Saban left LSU to coach the [[Miami Dolphins]].\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\n\nSaban accepted the head coaching position for the [[Miami Dolphins]] on December 25, 2004. He was the sixth coach in the franchise's history. The Nick Saban era officially kicked off with a 34\u201310 win over the [[2005 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|2005]]. From there, however, the Dolphins struggled, losing seven of their next nine games to fall to 3\u20137. The two wins came over the [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] and the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], a game that took place in [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] due to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. After a frustrating two months, however, the Dolphins would rally late in the season, as they won their final six games, including a win to end the season in [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]] over the [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. The team finished the year with a 9\u20137 record, and narrowly missed the playoffs in Saban's first season.\n\nGoing into the [[2006 Miami Dolphins season|2006]] season, the Dolphins were expected to contend for a playoff spot. The season, however, turned out to be a major disappointment. The Dolphins were considering quarterback [[Drew Brees]], who had just been released from the [[San Diego Chargers]] due to a career-threatening shoulder injury and subsequent contract dispute, but instead signed [[Daunte Culpepper]], who was still recovering from a knee injury from the previous season. Culpepper never fully recovered and was ultimately benched after the fourth game of the season, when the Dolphins lost to the [[Houston Texans]]. He was eventually put on [[injured reserve]]. After starting the season 1\u20136, however, the Dolphins got hot. They won four straight games, including wins over the [[Chicago Bears]], who were previously unbeaten and made it to the [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] that year, and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Suddenly, the Dolphins were back in the playoff hunt at 5\u20136, but a 24\u201310 loss the following week to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] all but ended their playoff hopes. The Dolphins would rebound the following week with a 21\u20130 win over the [[New England Patriots]]. The win would be the last bright spot for the Dolphins in the 2006 season. Quarterback [[Joey Harrington]] was eventually benched in favor of third-string quarterback [[Cleo Lemon]]. While the defense was very good, the offense was anemic, with the only bright spot being running back [[Ronnie Brown]], who gained over 1,000 rushing yards on the season. The Dolphins would lose their next two games to the [[Buffalo Bills]] and the [[New York Jets]] to finish 6\u201310, Saban's first losing season as a head coach.\n\nOn November 27, 2006, the [[University of Alabama]] announced the firing of head coach [[Mike Shula]]. Saban was rumored to be at the top of Alabama's wish list, but Saban refused to discuss the job while his NFL season was still underway.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.floridafb.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11200&ATCLID=729980|title=Saban Denies Interest in the Alabama Coaching Job|agency=Associated Press|date=December 21, 2006|accessdate=December 16, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108210032/http://www.floridafb.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11200&ATCLID=729980|archivedate=January 8, 2009}}</ref> During the month of December 2006, Saban was repeatedly questioned by the media about the Alabama job, and he repeatedly denied the rumors in his weekly press conferences, stating on December 21 \"I guess I have to say it.
