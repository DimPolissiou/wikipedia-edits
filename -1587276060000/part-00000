It also angered the [[Kikuyu people]], who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of [[World War II]], this friction developed into the [[Mau Mau]] rebellion. [[Jomo Kenyatta]], Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n===Post Independence===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and [[Water scarcity|water shortages]] were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zicht op Nairobi met op de voorgrond het stadspark met tribune TMnr 20014416.jpg|thumb|Nairobi in 1973]]\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.<ref>[http://kicc.co.ke/about/ourhistory \"Our History\"], The Kenyatta International Convention Centre.</ref>\n\nThree years prior in 1972, the [[World Bank]] approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road).

Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]] and [[Meja Mwangi]] who were part of post-colonial writing.\n\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\n\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is ''[[Out of Africa]]''. The book was written by [[Karen Blixen]], whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in [[Kenya]]. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], is named after her.\n\nIn 1985, ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' was made into a film, directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. The film won 28 awards, including seven [[Academy Awards]]. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's [[Karen Blixen Museum (Kenya)|Karen Blixen Museum]].\n\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]], Kenya's foremost writer.\n\nNairobi has been the set of several other [[Cinema of the United States|American]] and [[British Film Industry|British]] films. The most recent of these was ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the [[Kibera]] slum.\n\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is [[Lupita Nyong'o]]. Lupita received an Oscar award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|best supporting actress]] in her role as Patsy in the film ''[[12 Years a Slave]]'' during the ''[[86th Academy Awards]]'' at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\n\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinemas]] in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series ''[[Sense8]]'' which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in [[The Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB).\n\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film ''[[Eye in the Sky (2015 film)|Eye in the Sky]]'', which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series ''[[Money Heist]]''.\n\n===Food===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to ''[[nyama choma]]'' which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as [[KFC]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Hardee's]] and [[Burger King]] which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, [[Galittos]], [[Steers]], [[PizzaMojo]], [[Spur Steak Ranches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing?lite |title=Fast food finds fans in sub-Sahara Africa, where obesity problem is growing \u2013 World News |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, [[Nairobi Java House]] and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\n\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.  Nairobi's restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eatout.co.ke/nairobi-restaurant-week |title=Nairobi Restaurant Week 2016 |last=Kenya |first=EatOut |website=eatout.co.ke |access-date=10 April 2016}}</ref> NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.\n\n===Music===\n\nNairobi is the centre of Kenya's music scene. [[Benga music|Benga]] is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of [[jazz]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]] music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\n\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the [[African Great Lakes]]. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of [[soukous]] music. This genre was originally developed in [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. After the political climate in the region [[Congo Crisis|deteriorated]], many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi. Artists such as [[Super Mazembe|Orchestra Super Mazembe]] moved from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] to Nairobi and found great success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orchestra Super Mazembe |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |accessdate=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231064112/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/orchestra_super_mazembe_28113 |archivedate=31 December 2007}}</ref> [[Virgin records]] became aware of the popularity of the genre and signed recording contracts with several [[soukous]] artists.\n\nMore recently, Nairobi has become the centre of the [[Kenyan hip hop]] scene, with Kalamashaka, Gidi Gidi Majimaji being the pioneers of urban music in Kenyan. The genre has become very popular amongst local youth, and domestic musicians have become some of the most popular in the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Successful artists based in Nairobi include [[Jua Cali]], [[Nonini]], Camp Mulla, Juliani, Eric Wainaina, Suzanna Owinyo and [[David Mathenge|Nameless]]. Popular Record labels include [[Ogopa DJs]], Grand Pa Records, Main Switch, Red Black and Green Republik, [[Calif Records]] and Bornblack Music Group.\n\nMany foreign musicians who tour Africa perform in Nairobi.

The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. Currently it is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\n*[[Strathmore University]] started in 1961 as an [[Advanced Level (UK)]] Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\n* [[United States International University|United States International University \u2013 Nairobi]] was originally a branch of the [[United States International University]], but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\n* In 2005, The [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi]] was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\n[[File:Catholic University of Eastern Africa - garden.jpg|thumb|[[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]]]]\n* The [[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]] located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989.

Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor|LAPPSET]] project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\n\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to [[Kisumu]].\n\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\n\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\n\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the [[President of Kenya]] Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge.

In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-[[jet aircraft|jet]] airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from [[Southampton]] to [[Cape Town]] in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by [[flying boat]]s between Britain and [[Kisumu]] and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n====Matatu====\n[[File:A matatu.jpg|thumb|A matatu]]\n{{main|Matatu}}\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\n[[Matatu]], which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport.<ref>{{cite web|last=United Nations Offices Nairobi Interns |title=How to get around Nairobi |publisher=interns.unon.org |url=http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075002/http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2007 |accessdate=5 July 2007 }}</ref> They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite [[association football|football]] team or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist. More recently, some have even painted [[Barack Obama]]'s face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\n\nHowever, in 2004, a [[Seat belt legislation|law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts]] and [[speed governor]]s and to be painted with a yellow stripe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crackdown hits Kenyan commuters|publisher=BBC|date=2 February 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|accessdate=3 July 2006 }}</ref> At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n====Buses====\n[[File:Nairobi Public Transport.jpg|thumb|Public transport in Nairobi]]\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\n\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n====Trains====\nNairobi was founded as a [[railway town]], and the main headquarters of [[Kenya Railways|Kenya Railways (KR)]] is still situated at [[Nairobi railway station]], which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from [[Mombasa]] to [[Kampala]]. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and [[Kisumu]]. A number of morning and evening commuter [[Nairobi rail service|trains]] connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\n\nThe new [[Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway]] connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The [[Nairobi Terminus]] is located at [[Syokimau]], some 20&nbsp;km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Museam hill interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Museum hill interchange, where Uhuru highway links to forest road which is an extension of the Thika superhighway. Nairobi's tall skyscrapers can be seen on the background.]]\n[[File:The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD]]\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. [[Ongata Rongai]], Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by [[Thika Road]], Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\n\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), [[Eldoret]], [[Kisumu]], [[Nakuru]], [[Naivasha]], and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\n\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n[[File:Eastern Bypass, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|Eastern Bypass, Nairobi]]\n\n====Private car population projection for Nairobi====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It also angered the [[Kikuyu people]], who wanted the land returned to them. After the end of [[World War II]], this friction developed into the [[Mau Mau]] rebellion. [[Jomo Kenyatta]], Kenya's future president, was jailed for his involvement even though there was no evidence linking him to the rebellion. The pressure exerted from the locals onto the British resulted in Kenyan independence in 1963, with Nairobi as the capital of the new republic.\n\n===Post Independence===\nAfter independence, Nairobi grew rapidly and this growth put pressure on the city's infrastructure. Power cuts and [[Water scarcity|water shortages]] were a common occurrence, though in the past few years better city planning has helped to put some of these problems in check.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zicht op Nairobi met op de voorgrond het stadspark met tribune TMnr 20014416.jpg|thumb|Nairobi in 1973]]\n\nOn 11 September 1973, the [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik N\u00f8stvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. The construction was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower, and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring on 11 September and being presided over by Kenya's founding father President Kenyatta. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.<ref>[http://kicc.co.ke/about/ourhistory \"Our History\"], The Kenyatta International Convention Centre.</ref>\n\nThree years prior in 1972, the [[World Bank]] approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road).

The city's colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.\n\nMost lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants', Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, [[Dandora]], [[Kariobangi]], [[Kayole]], [[Embakasi]], and [[Huruma]]. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as 'Diaspora' to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area.

Uhuru (''Freedom'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President [[Daniel arap Moi]], who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the [[Kenya African National Union]], situated in the park.<ref>{{cite web|last=The Standard |title=Kenyans must have a sustained campaign against land grabbing |publisher=eastandard.net |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=4451&date=30/10/2004 |accessdate=25 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113092330/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news_s.php?articleid=4451&date=30%2F10%2F2004 |archivedate=13 January 2015 }}</ref> However, the park was saved following a campaign by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]].\n\nCentral Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for [[Jomo Kenyatta]], the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president's first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include [[Jeevanjee Gardens]], City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.\n\nThe colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning.

This suggests a current (2011) growth rate of 3.5% (the CIA estimate of 4.5% cited above would have been true in 2005). According to this curve, the population of the city will be below 4 million in 2015, and will reach 5&nbsp;million in 2025.\n\nGiven this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 40% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighborhoods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oyugi|first=Maurice Onyango|last2=K\u2019Akumu|first2=Owiti A.|title=Land use management challenges for the city of Nairobi|journal=Urban Forum|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=94\u2013113|doi=10.1007/BF02681232|issn=1015-3802|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[Kenya National Theatre]], and the [[Kenya National Archives]].

Nairobi's publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya's authors, including [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]] and [[Meja Mwangi]] who were part of post-colonial writing.\n\nMany film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.\n\nPerhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is ''[[Out of Africa]]''. The book was written by [[Karen Blixen]], whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in [[Kenya]]. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], is named after her.\n\nIn 1985, ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' was made into a film, directed by [[Sydney Pollack]]. The film won 28 awards, including seven [[Academy Awards]]. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi's [[Karen Blixen Museum (Kenya)|Karen Blixen Museum]].\n\nNairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]], Kenya's foremost writer.\n\nNairobi has been the set of several other [[Cinema of the United States|American]] and [[British Film Industry|British]] films. The most recent of these was ''[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]'' (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the [[Kibera]] slum.\n\nAmong the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is [[Lupita Nyong'o]]. Lupita received an Oscar award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|best supporting actress]] in her role as Patsy in the film ''[[12 Years a Slave]]'' during the ''[[86th Academy Awards]]'' at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang' Nyong'o.\n\nMost new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi's cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinemas]] in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series ''[[Sense8]]'' which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in [[The Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB).\n\nIn 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film ''[[Eye in the Sky (2015 film)|Eye in the Sky]]'', which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.\n\nIn 2017, the name \"Nairobi\" was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series ''[[Money Heist]]''.\n\n===Food===\nIn Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants and, besides being home to ''[[nyama choma]]'' which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as [[KFC]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Hardee's]] and [[Burger King]] which are popular, and the longer established South African chains, [[Galittos]], [[Steers]], [[PizzaMojo]], [[Spur Steak Ranches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing?lite |title=Fast food finds fans in sub-Sahara Africa, where obesity problem is growing \u2013 World News |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants, mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe, [[Nairobi Java House]] and Dormans have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K'osewe's in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.\n\nNairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January\u2013February.

[[Benga music|Benga]] is a Kenyan genre which was developed in Nairobi. The style is a fusion of [[jazz]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]] music forms. Mugithi is another popular genre in Kenya, with its origins in the central parts of the country. A majority of music videos of leading local musicians are also filmed in the city.\n\nIn the 1970s, Nairobi became the prominent centre for music in the [[African Great Lakes]]. During this period, Nairobi was established as a hub of [[soukous]] music. This genre was originally developed in [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]]. After the political climate in the region [[Congo Crisis|deteriorated]], many Congolese artists relocated to Nairobi.

The university has approximately 84,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|title=University of Nairobi Factfile \u2013 UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI|publisher=|access-date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035948/http://uonbi.ac.ke/node/4315|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n** [[South Eastern Kenya University]] is a constituent college of the University of Nairobi.<ref>[https://www.seku.ac.ke South Eastern Kenya University]</ref>\n* [[Kenyatta University]] is situated {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Nairobi on the Nairobi road Thika dual carriageway on {{convert|1100|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land. The university was chartered in 1985, offering mainly education-related courses, but has since diversified, offering medicine, environmental studies, engineering, law, business, statistics, agriculture, and economics. It has a student body of about 32,000, the bulk of whom (17,000) are in the main (Kahawa Sukari) campus. Currently it is one of the fastest-growing public universities.\n*[[Strathmore University]] started in 1961 as an [[Advanced Level (UK)]] Sixth Form College offering Science and Arts subjects. The college started to admit accountancy students in March 1966, and thus became a university. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate, Nairobi.\n* [[United States International University|United States International University \u2013 Nairobi]] was originally a branch of the [[United States International University]], but became a fully autonomous university in 2005. It was first established in 1969. The university has accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in the US, and the Government of Kenya. It is located in a quiet west side location of Roysambu area north-central Nairobi opposite the Safari Park Hotel.\n* In 2005, The [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi]] was upgraded to a health sciences teaching hospital, providing post graduate education in medicine and surgery including nursing education, henceforth renamed the Aga Khan University Hospital.\n[[File:Catholic University of Eastern Africa - garden.jpg|thumb|[[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]]]]\n* The [[Catholic University of Eastern Africa]] located in Langata suburb, obtained its \"Letter of Interim Authority\" in 1989. Following negotiations between the Authority of the Graduate School of Theology and the Commission for Higher Education (CHIEA), the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was established three years later, culminating in the granting of the Civil Charter to CHIEA on 3 November 1992.\n* [[Technical University of Kenya|The Technical University of Kenya]] (formerly Kenya Polytechnic) is the only [[Institute of technology|Technical University]] in the country. Established in 1961 as the Kenya Technical Institute, the University was chartered by [[Mwai Kibaki]] in 2013 to become an independent institution of higher learning (It was previously a constituent college of the University of Nairobi).  It offers highly technical degree courses in three faculties: Engineering and Built Environment, Applied Sciences and Technologies, and Social Sciences and Technologies. \n* [[KCA University]] (formerly the Kenya College of Accountancy), located in Ruaraka.\n* The Presbyterian University of East Africa (PUEA) is also another Institution of higher learning that is located in the town. It has several campuses around the town.\n[[File:Umma University.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Umma University]]]]\n* [[Pan African Christian University]] is located along Lumumba Drive, Roysambu.\n* [[East Africa Institute of Certified Studies]] (well known as ICS College) is located at Stanbank House with branches in Mombasa and Kisumu.\n* [[Compugoal College]]\n* [[Riara University]] on Mbagathi road.\n* [[Umma University]] is the first Islamic Institution of higher education in Kenya. The main campus is located in Kajiado County. Other branches are located in Thika-Makongeni off Garissa road and Nairobi's Central Business District at Jamia Towers.\n\nNumerous other universities have also opened satellite campuses in Nairobi. The Railways Training Institute established in 1956, is also a notable institution of higher learning with a campus in Nairobi.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n[[File:Syokimau Railway Station.jpg|thumb|300px|Syokimau Railway Station]]\n\nMajor plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city's traffic and the completion of [[Thika Road]] has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road's enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway. The country's head of state announced (when he opened Syokimau Rail Service) that Kenya was collaborating with other countries in the region to develop railway infrastructure to improve regional connectivity under the ambitious [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor|LAPPSET]] project which is the single largest and most expensive in the continent.\n\nKenya signed a bilateral agreement with Uganda to facilitate joint development of the Mombasa-Malaba-Kampala standard gauge railway. A branch line will also be extended to [[Kisumu]].\n\nSimilarly, Kenya signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Ethiopia for the development of Lamu-Addis Ababa standard gauge railway. Under the Lamu-South Sudan and Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project, the development of a railway component is among the priority projects.\n\nThe development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country's potential in attracting investments from all over the world.\n\nThe first phase of the standard gauge railway project was launched on 31 May 2017 by the [[President of Kenya]] Uhuru Kenyatta in a ceremony that saw thousands of Kenyans ride on the inaugural trip free of charge. The two passenger locomotives christened ''Madaraka Express'' currently operate daily trips between Nairobi and Mombasa.\n\n====Airports====\n[[File:Nairobi Arrivals Terminal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]]]]\n[[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016.

In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-[[jet aircraft|jet]] airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from [[Southampton]] to [[Cape Town]] in the 1930s & 1940s. This route was served by [[flying boat]]s between Britain and [[Kisumu]] and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.\n\n====Matatu====\n[[File:A matatu.jpg|thumb|A matatu]]\n{{main|Matatu}}\nMatatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi.\n[[Matatu]], which literally translates to \"three cents for a ride\" (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses, and the most popular form of local transport.<ref>{{cite web|last=United Nations Offices Nairobi Interns |title=How to get around Nairobi |publisher=interns.unon.org |url=http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075002/http://interns.unon.org/index%206.1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2007 |accessdate=5 July 2007 }}</ref> They generally seat fourteen to twenty-four. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu's route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers. However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite [[association football|football]] team or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist. More recently, some have even painted [[Barack Obama]]'s face on their vehicle. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.\n\nHowever, in 2004, a [[Seat belt legislation|law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts]] and [[speed governor]]s and to be painted with a yellow stripe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crackdown hits Kenyan commuters|publisher=BBC|date=2 February 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3450777.stm|accessdate=3 July 2006 }}</ref> At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. However, many of the matatu vehicles have had their speed governors disabled, which is evident by them travelling at speeds well over {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n====Buses====\n[[File:Nairobi Public Transport.jpg|thumb|Public transport in Nairobi]]\nBuses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.\n\nCompanies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.\n\n====Trains====\nNairobi was founded as a [[railway town]], and the main headquarters of [[Kenya Railways|Kenya Railways (KR)]] is still situated at [[Nairobi railway station]], which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from [[Mombasa]] to [[Kampala]]. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and [[Kisumu]]. A number of morning and evening commuter [[Nairobi rail service|trains]] connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country's third president since independence, President [[Mwai Kibaki]] on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.\n\nThe new [[Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway]] connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The [[Nairobi Terminus]] is located at [[Syokimau]], some 20&nbsp;km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Museam hill interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Museum hill interchange, where Uhuru highway links to forest road which is an extension of the Thika superhighway. Nairobi's tall skyscrapers can be seen on the background.]]\n[[File:The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|The A104 heading to Nairobi CBD]]\n\nNairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. [[Ongata Rongai]], Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by [[Thika Road]], Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.\n\nHighways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), [[Eldoret]], [[Kisumu]], [[Nakuru]], [[Naivasha]], and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).\n\nNairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new systems of roads, flyovers, and bridges would cut outrageous traffic levels caused the inability of the current infrastructure to cope with the soaring economic growth in the past few years. It is also a major component of Kenya's Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.\n\n[[File:Eastern Bypass, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|Eastern Bypass, Nairobi]]\n\n====Private car population projection for Nairobi====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Occurrences during [[prenatal development]] may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Prenatal thumb sucking is related to postnatal handedness| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.08.009|pmid=15707608|volume=43|issue=3|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=313\u2013315|year=2005 | last1 = Hepper | first1 = Peter G.}}</ref> In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson EL, Campbell JM, Michel GF | year = 2013 | title = Unimanual to bimanual: Tracking the development of handedness from 6 to 24 months | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 181\u2013188 | pmc=3615031 | doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.01.009 | pmid=23454419}}</ref>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nOne common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.\n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.\n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, \"in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001 \u2013 including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!\"<ref name=\"about\" />\n\n== In other animals ==\n[[Kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s show a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. 'True' handedness is unexpected in marsupials however, because unlike [[Placentalia|placental mammals]], they lack a [[corpus callosum]]. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (''Macropus rufus'') and the eastern gray kangaroo (''Macropus giganteus''). Red-necked (Bennett's) wallabies (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.

It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed $709 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2014]], but the second-lowest-grossing Spider-Man film to date.\n\n''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' was originally envisioned as the beginning of a shared fictional universe, which would have continued with two sequels and several spin-offs, most notably films centered on [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the [[Sinister Six]]. Due to performing below expectations, all subsequent installments were cancelled and a [[Reboot (fiction)|new iteration]] of the character, portrayed by [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), began with the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. The planned spin-offs were re-purposed for a [[Sony's Marvel Universe|timeline separate from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' continuity and the MCU]], beginning with 2018's [[Venom (2018 film)|''Venom'']], the upcoming 2020's ''[[Venom 2]]'' & 2021's ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Oscorp]] scientist Richard Parker records a video message to explain his disappearance. Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by an assassin sent to kill Richard and his wife. Richard and Mary fight off the man, but the ensuing struggle causes the plane to crash, killing both Richard and Mary, after he uploads the video.\n\nIn the present time, Richard's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as [[Spider-Man]]. He pursues and apprehends [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Later, Peter meets with his girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]] at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her late father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, [[Harry Osborn]], returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]], CEO of Oscorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new Oscorp CEO.\n\nWhile working in an Oscorp laboratory, electrical engineer [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon]] shocks himself by accident and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered [[electric eel]]s. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England if she earns a scholarship to [[Oxford University]]. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into [[Times Square]], accidentally causing a blackout, and is stopped by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to the Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist [[Dr. Kafka]]. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry becomes resentful towards Spider-Man. Oscorp vice-president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, removes him as CEO and takes control of Oscorp. Harry's assistant, [[Felicia Hardy]], informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself \"Electro,\" to get him back inside the Oscorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harry's illness, and transforms him into a [[Green Goblin|goblin-like creature]], but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health and cures his disease.\n\nPeter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the Oxford scholarship and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He catches her and professes his love for her, and they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout and Peter prepares to battle him as Spider-Man. Gwen insists on helping Spider-Man but he declines her offer of help. Fearing for Gwen\u2019s safety, Spider-Man ties her up with webs, effectively handcuffing her to a vehicle. Gwen eventually frees herself from her web restraints and follows Spider-Man. Together they restore power and overload Electro's body, killing him.\n\nThe transformed Harry, who now calls himself \"Green Goblin\", arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry. Upon seeing Gwen, he deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her and takes her to the top of a clock tower. Spider-Man defeats Harry, but his webbing breaks during the battle, and Gwen falls. Peter tries but is unable to save her. Mourning her death,  the depressed Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.\n\nFive months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, [[The Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers]], visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own [[Sinister Six|team]]. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him.\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ABOUT THE X-MEN MID CREDIT SCENE.

DeHaan, Giamatti, Jones, and Cooper were cast between December 2012 and February 2013. Filming took place in [[New York City]] from February to June 2013. The film was released in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] on May 2, 2014, in the United States with two international premieres being held between March 31 and April 10 of that year. It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed $709 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2014]], but the second-lowest-grossing Spider-Man film to date.\n\n''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' was originally envisioned as the beginning of a shared fictional universe, which would have continued with two sequels and several spin-offs, most notably films centered on [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the [[Sinister Six]]. Due to performing below expectations, all subsequent installments were cancelled and a [[Reboot (fiction)|new iteration]] of the character, portrayed by [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), began with the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. The planned spin-offs were re-purposed for a [[Sony's Marvel Universe|timeline separate from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' continuity and the MCU]], beginning with 2018's [[Venom (2018 film)|''Venom'']], the upcoming 2020's ''[[Venom 2]]'' & 2021's ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Oscorp]] scientist Richard Parker records a video message to explain his disappearance. Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by an assassin sent to kill Richard and his wife. Richard and Mary fight off the man, but the ensuing struggle causes the plane to crash, killing both Richard and Mary, after he uploads the video.\n\nIn the present time, Richard's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as [[Spider-Man]]. He pursues and apprehends [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Later, Peter meets with his girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]] at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her late father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, [[Harry Osborn]], returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, [[Norman Osborn|Norman]], CEO of Oscorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new Oscorp CEO.\n\nWhile working in an Oscorp laboratory, electrical engineer [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon]] shocks himself by accident and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered [[electric eel]]s. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England if she earns a scholarship to [[Oxford University]]. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into [[Times Square]], accidentally causing a blackout, and is stopped by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to the Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist [[Dr. Kafka]]. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry becomes resentful towards Spider-Man. Oscorp vice-president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, removes him as CEO and takes control of Oscorp. Harry's assistant, [[Felicia Hardy]], informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself \"Electro,\" to get him back inside the Oscorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harry's illness, and transforms him into a [[Green Goblin|goblin-like creature]], but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health and cures his disease.\n\nPeter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the Oxford scholarship, and is heading to the airport earlier than expected. He catches her and professes his love for her, and they agree to go to England together. Electro causes another blackout, and Peter heads off to battle him as Spider-Man. Gwen follows, and together, they restore power, and [[overcurrent|overload]] Electro's body, killing him.\n\nThe transformed Harry, who now calls himself \"Green Goblin\", arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry. Upon seeing Gwen, he deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her and takes her to the top of a clock tower. Spider-Man defeats Harry, but his webbing breaks during the battle, and Gwen falls. Peter tries but is unable to save her. Mourning her death,  the depressed Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.\n\nFive months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, [[The Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers]], visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own [[Sinister Six|team]]. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him.\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ABOUT THE X-MEN MID CREDIT SCENE.

The film stars [[Jayam Ravi]] and [[Raashi Khanna]] with [[Ponvannan]], [[Ramdoss]], [[Sampath Raj]], [[Mime Gopi]], and [[Azhagam Perumal]] in supporting roles. The score and soundtrack was composed by [[Sam C. S.]], while cinematography and editing was handled by [[Sathyan Sooryan]] and [[Anthony L. Ruben]] respectively. The film began production in December 2017 and released on 21 December 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nSubhash is an sincere and new Sub-Inspector of Police in Chennai. He resides with his father, mother, elder brother, his wife, and their twin daughters. He is all set to marry his fianc\u00e9e Anitha. He is new to his job and is assisted by Constable Ramadass and SSI Chandran. Subhash cannot stand the suffering of the public and looks for ways to better their lives, and this often lands him in trouble with his superior Inspector Muthukaruppan.\n\nOne day, Chandran and Subhash are called on to investigate the supposed suicide of a girl. On closer investigation, Subhash deduces that it was not a suicide and that she was murdered. While collecting evidence to support this, he comes across a person called Abhijit (Bharath Raj), whose cell number was active near the place. On confronting Abhijit and his friends Christy, Bhuvanesh, and Deepak, they reveal that they are all stoners from affluent families and show a video of them doing drugs, raping and murdering the girl and many other women, as well. Subhash gets enraged, beats them up, and locks them in jail. When his superior, a corrupt Joint Commissioner Saarangan IPS, asks for the proof behind his accusations, he finds out that the phone had automatically deleted all the video files just as he was trying to unlock it. The four are released due to lack of evidence and the influence of their respective fathers and Subhash is suspended. Abhijit and his friends vow revenge and soon enough, when Subhash goes home, he finds his parents and brother's family dead. Only one of his nieces, Anusha, is left alive. Meanwhile, Saarangan is bribed with a Porsche car and reports the murder of Subhash's family as a fire accident at their new house. Dejected at his powerlessness even though he is a police officer, Subhash resigns and threatens Saarangan that he will avenge his family's death and will make sure that the four guys die mercilessly at the hands of their own fathers.\n\nFirst, he kidnaps Bhuvan and locks him in a car with a mechanism that fills silane gas in it if anyone tries to open the door. Bhuvan's father, the district collector, accidentally opens the car door as he searches for his missing son, and Bhuvan is burnt alive in front of his father. Next, he kidnaps Deepak and Christy and keeps them at undisclosed locations. The police, in order to find the missing guys, try to unofficially arrest Subhash at gunpoint, but he triggers Muthukaruppan's pistol on purpose, resulting in his arrest and gaining unwanted public attention. With increasing media and political attention, Saarangan and the rich fathers are unable to carry out extreme measures of interrogation on Subhash, though he is in custody. Subhash then reveals to all of them that he kept Christy in a van and asks him to go to the airport, but Christy's father double crosses Subhash and asks him to run for help, thinking that Christy is safe when police and the public are nearby. Before Christy could do so, an auto-loaded gun in his bag starts beeping, and Christy, assumed to be a terrorist, is brutally shot and killed by the Paramilitary Force (CISF) soldiers to safeguard the public. After this, Deepak is found to be locked in a glass tank connected to harmful chemicals. Subhash and his tech friend expose him as a rapist to the public via an online gaming link, where the public can virtually try to shoot at Deepak in order to release the chemicals into the tank and eventually kill him. His father hires hackers to stop this, and when Deepak's location is found, he goes there and breaks open the tank to release him, but the chemicals instantly blow up, and he is killed. Meanwhile, Subhash also threatens Saarangan to check on his teenage daughter's safety. Saarangan panics but is relieved when she is found to be safe. Saarangan realizes his mistake and decides to support Subhash in his fight for justice to the rape and murder victims.\n\nNow that only Abhijit is left, his father Sanjay, a business tycoon, decides to release Subhash from custody and deal with him alone. Subhash tactfully kidnaps Abhijit and has him hanging on a rope. He also threatens to upload the video evidence online and expose their crimes, thereby bringing Sanjay's business empire down. He gives Sanjay an ultimatum that he could either hold on to the rope and save his son or let go and shut down the laptop instead, to save his reputation. In the end, the power-hungry Sanjay decides to save his reputation and lets go of the rope, killing Abhijit.\n\nOne year later, Subhash has become a peace-loving IPS officer, who murders criminals out of record to serve justice.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Jayam Ravi]] as S.
