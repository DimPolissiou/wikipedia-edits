The show is set in Mirador de Montepinar, a condominium located in the suburbs of [[Madrid]]. The show is an indirect successor to the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] comedy ''[[Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva]]''. The name is a pun on the verb \"avecinarse\", which means both \"become neighbour to\" and \"approach\", and is used in expression ''la que se avecina'' meaning \"the trouble that is approaching\", so it alludes both to being neighbours and the friction that exists between the characters.\n\n''La que se avecina'' debuted on Telecinco, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n|FDF]] and [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Espa\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' vs 'La que se avecina': el duelo resucita en la TDT |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/15023/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-vs-la-que-se-avecina-el-duelo-resucita-en-la-tdt/ |work=FormulaTV |date=11 May 2010 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='La que se avecina' y 'Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' tambi\u00e9n triunfan en Paramount Comedy |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/23559/la-que-se-avecina-aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-tambien-triunfan-paramount-comedy/ |work=Formula TV |date=12 February 2012 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref> The series debuted on 22 April 2007, the show began to become much more prominent in its third season, becoming one of the most widely watched shows in Spain.

On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaqu\u00edn is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the show flat on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Mait\u00e9 Figueroa Espinosa and their three children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father. The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentine and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to marry Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Mait\u00e9 takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Mait\u00e9 remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Mait\u00e9 alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Mait\u00e9, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Mait\u00e9, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is Judith and Enrique's marriage. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first nine episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Mait\u00e9, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Mait\u00e9, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and marry. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Mait\u00e9 continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job at Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after six months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Mait\u00e9 leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Mait\u00e9 and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Mait\u00e9 will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn. Mait\u00e9 writes an erotic novel based on the romances of Mirador de Montepinar. Berta will go to a spa at her bachelorette party with the girls in the building and she will meet Araceli with whom she is about to go to bed when the owner of the spa (Araceli's girlfriend) sees them. Araceli when she breaks up with her, without a house, goes to Bajo B and will make Enrique and Teresa break up. Judith tries to return with Trevor but he already expects a son with another girl. Rebeca throws her out of the house and goes with Dylan to live with Enrique. La Chusa and Ferm\u00edn break up and she refuses to leave, even though she does not pay the rent. Raquel falls in love with Diego, Fina's son, but Fina intervenes and gets Diego to think that she is crazy. Antonio sees how his son is now: a woman. It happens to be called \u00c1lvaro a Alba. Alba starts dating Leo. Antonio and Berta marry. To Mait\u00e9 they publish the book to him and it is reconciled with Amador and buys with him the Under A, where La Chusa de okupa is. Enrique, fed up with Judith, Araceli and Teresa treating him badly, leaves them with a note.\n\n===Season 9 (2016)===\nVicente is named the new president of Mirador de Montepinar. His consort Ferm\u00edn, moves with him to 2\u00baB to help him with the mandate since Vicente is not excited. However, the power of these two will be full of ups and downs. Enrique returns to the community because his party has named him mayor after the departure of Mar\u00eda Teresa. Enrique will have to learn from Crist\u00f3bal, a corrupt politician. After eight seasons, Leo dies when the parachute is not opened in a gift from Alba. Alba overcomes her depression with Teodoro, Amador's brother, with whom she marries. Teodoro refloats his father-in-law Antonio's fishmonger, but his friendship is not earned. Alba will save to do the sex change operation and then will have to wait to be able to \"consummate\" which is what Theodore is waiting impatiently. After the departure of Rebeca, Judith will not stop giving emotional thrombi. Between his ligues they are: a trainer obsessed with the sport, a homosexual Catholic, a patient with an imaginary friend, Trevor, a millionaire friend of Javi ... At the end of the season he goes to Ibiza where he falls in love and leaves the Serie. Mait\u00e9 is again what it was like: a penny with money. With La Chusa as a maid, Mait\u00e9 pays Amador a salary to keep custody of her four children, some spoiled. Start a relationship with Hector, a hipster. Amador rents 2\u00baA with Teodoro. Then he meets Yolanda \"Yoli\" a seamstress with a safe and problematic character. Yoli will bring her mother, Menchu, noisy and like her daughter, causing several problems, such as: Causing Teodoro and Alba to leave the 2nd A and leave with Antonio and Berta, not accept that Amador leaves him and try to have children with him, renting Enrique the Low B after the departure of Araceli and settling in Attic A with his mother at the end of the season. Besides, they emphasize their fights with Mait\u00e9, Alba ... The relationship between Nines and Coque will go through problems. Fermin tries to conquer Araceli until she leaves. Fine take it with Javi and Lola, who are still fighting for their love despite their debts. Bruno is a pianist who has just been abandoned by his wife. She becomes a patient of Judith and needs her help so much that she moves to the 1st B, property of the late Leo. Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... In the end, the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has, so Mait\u00e9 hires a hit man. Theodore breaks up with Alba because he did not like it when they made love. The hit man shoots Amador but he covers himself with Theodore without knowing if he lives or dies. Diego returns, the son of Fina. Diego sees at last how his mother really is and it seems that he is going to send her to a nursing home. Besides, a relationship with Raquel begins, with which it seems that he is leaving for China. It is not known if Theodore lives or if Raquel and Fina have left.\n\n===Season 10 (2017\u201318)===\nFina escapes from the nursing home where she was interned and returns to live at 2&nbsp;\u00b0C. Berta and Antonio are still married but the latter wants them to live separately and goes to live with Enrique, leaving Berta living at 1&nbsp;\u00b0C along with her daughter Alba, who is now single because she has left him with Teodoro. Both will have to carry with difficulty the business of Mariscos Recios, before the passivity of its owner to 50%, Antonio. Alba will be attracted to Enrique throughout the season and will have several encounters behind Antonio's back. After the departure of Judith, are Yoli and Menchu who buy Attic A, characters that will cause multiple problems in the building. Ferm\u00edn, who continues his relationship with Menchu, will go live with them. In addition, he will continue to serve as \"Richelieu\" of the new president, Bruno Quiroga. The latter will try to maintain an asexual relationship with Mait\u00e9, who will also have meetings with Hector, who has returned to Montepinar. Coque ends his relationship with Nines and takes vacations, leaving the community with the vacant janitor plaza. In addition, he goes to live with Enrique and Antonio at Bajo B. The latter recover the bar from the catastrophic rental contract that Enrique maintained with Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, baptizing him as Tony and Henry. Nines leaves her job and instead it will be Alba who at first helps her father in the business. Theodore and Amador are again the only tenants of the second. The latter will try to recover Yoli's love, although she passes from him; Meanwhile, he will pretend to be Fina's caregiver in front of Diego, his son, in exchange for a salary and with the objective that Diego stays calm and stops visiting his mother so much. Diego will begin a relationship with Raquel and will take her to China although eventually she returns. Mait\u00e9 will have to share with her assistant La Chusa with Bruno, who also hires her and who also gets pregnant through artificial insemination. During Coque's vacation period, Ferm\u00edn hired Clara as her fellow, who is Menchu's niece and whom she recommends to minimize an important expense such as the janitor's salary.\n\n==Cast and

The show is set in Mirador de Montepinar, a condominium located in the suburbs of [[Madrid]]. The show is an indirect successor to the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] comedy ''[[Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva]]''. The name is a pun on the verb \"avecinarse\", which means both \"become neighbour to\" and \"approach\", and is used in expression ''la que se avecina'' meaning \"the trouble that is approaching\", so it alludes both to being neighbours and the friction that exists between the characters.\n\n''La que se avecina'' debuted on Telecinco, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n|FDF]] and [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Espa\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' vs 'La que se avecina': el duelo resucita en la TDT |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/15023/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-vs-la-que-se-avecina-el-duelo-resucita-en-la-tdt/ |work=FormulaTV |date=11 May 2010 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='La que se avecina' y 'Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' tambi\u00e9n triunfan en Paramount Comedy |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/23559/la-que-se-avecina-aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-tambien-triunfan-paramount-comedy/ |work=Formula TV |date=12 February 2012 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref> The series debuted on 22 April 2007, the show began to become much more prominent in its third season, becoming one of the most widely watched shows in Spain.

On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaqu\u00edn is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the show flat on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Mait\u00e9 Figueroa Espinosa and their three children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father. The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentine and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to marry Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Mait\u00e9 takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Mait\u00e9 remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Mait\u00e9 alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Mait\u00e9, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Mait\u00e9, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is Judith and Enrique's marriage. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first nine episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Mait\u00e9, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Mait\u00e9, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and marry. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Mait\u00e9 continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job at Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after six months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Mait\u00e9 leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Mait\u00e9 and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Mait\u00e9 will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn. Mait\u00e9 writes an erotic novel based on the romances of Mirador de Montepinar. Berta will go to a spa at her bachelorette party with the girls in the building and she will meet Araceli with whom she is about to go to bed when the owner of the spa (Araceli's girlfriend) sees them. Araceli when she breaks up with her, without a house, goes to Bajo B and will make Enrique and Teresa break up. Judith tries to return with Trevor but he already expects a son with another girl. Rebeca throws her out of the house and goes with Dylan to live with Enrique. La Chusa and Ferm\u00edn break up and she refuses to leave, even though she does not pay the rent. Raquel falls in love with Diego, Fina's son, but Fina intervenes and gets Diego to think that she is crazy. Antonio sees how his son is now: a woman. It happens to be called \u00c1lvaro a Alba. Alba starts dating Leo. Antonio and Berta marry. To Mait\u00e9 they publish the book to him and it is reconciled with Amador and buys with him the Under A, where La Chusa de okupa is. Enrique, fed up with Judith, Araceli and Teresa treating him badly, leaves them with a note.\n\n===Season 9 (2016)===\nVicente is named the new president of Mirador de Montepinar. His consort Ferm\u00edn, moves with him to 2\u00baB to help him with the mandate since Vicente is not excited. However, the power of these two will be full of ups and downs. Enrique returns to the community because his party has named him mayor after the departure of Mar\u00eda Teresa. Enrique will have to learn from Crist\u00f3bal, a corrupt politician. After eight seasons, Leo dies when the parachute is not opened in a gift from Alba. Alba overcomes her depression with Teodoro, Amador's brother, with whom she marries. Teodoro refloats his father-in-law Antonio's fishmonger, but his friendship is not earned. Alba will save to do the sex change operation and then will have to wait to be able to \"consummate\" which is what Theodore is waiting impatiently. After the departure of Rebeca, Judith will not stop giving emotional thrombi. Between his ligues they are: a trainer obsessed with the sport, a homosexual Catholic, a patient with an imaginary friend, Trevor, a millionaire friend of Javi ... At the end of the season he goes to Ibiza where he falls in love and leaves the Serie. Mait\u00e9 is again what it was like: a penny with money. With La Chusa as a maid, Mait\u00e9 pays Amador a salary to keep custody of her four children, some spoiled. Start a relationship with Hector, a hipster. Amador rents 2\u00baA with Teodoro. Then he meets Yolanda \"Yoli\" a seamstress with a safe and problematic character.

She becomes a patient of Judith and needs her help so much that she moves to the 1st B, property of the late Leo. Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... In the end, the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has, so Mait\u00e9 hires a hit man. Theodore breaks up with Alba because he did not like it when they made love. The hit man shoots Amador but he covers himself with Theodore without knowing if he lives or dies.

They finished with the most losses in [[American League]] history, and came within one loss of tying the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] for the [[List of worst MLB season records|most losses in modern major league history]].\n\nThe team went 43\u2013119, which surpassed the [[1916 Philadelphia Athletics season|1916 Philadelphia Athletics]] for the most losses in American League history. But due to a shorter season in 1916, the Athletics had a worse winning percentage and seven fewer wins (36-117 record) than the 2003 Tigers.  The Tigers were outscored by 337 runs over the course of the season (928 to 591) and finished 47 games behind the [[2003 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. Blame for the dismal season was shared by both the pitching staff, which had an ERA of 5.30, and the batters, who finished with a team batting average of .240, 19 points below the American League's .259 batting average.\n\n==Season overview==\n\nReeling off yet another losing season in [[2002 Detroit Tigers season|2002]], management found themselves in a big hole: a farm system that wasn't producing, a big-league club with major deficiencies, and contracts being paid to veterans not playing to expectations; those who did produce - [[Juan Acevedo]], [[Randall Simon]], and [[Robert Fick]], did not return for 2003.  Piloting the team was first-year manager and longtime Tiger favorite, [[Alan Trammell]], who had a dilemma nearly everywhere on the roster, particularly the starting rotation.  [[Gary Knotts]], who had pitched mostly in relief in his career,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/knottga01.shtml |title=Gary Knotts Stats |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> was to be converted to a starting role; Detroit area native [[Steve Avery]] was looking to make a comeback after not pitching in two years; two untested rookies, [[Jeremy Bonderman]] - drafted straight out of high school - and [[Nate Robertson]] - acquired in a trade for [[Mark Redman]] to the [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] - also vied for their chances to make the big-league rotation.\n\nResults were nothing short of disastrous.  The Tigers lost their first nine games, won their first against [[2003 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago]] on April 12, then proceeded to drop eight in a row to fall to 1-17.  An almost non-existent offense accounted for most of the team's early season woes, batting a paltry .228 as a team in the first half.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/tgl.cgi?team=DET&t=b&year=2003 |title=2003 Detroit Tigers Batting Log |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>  To the surprise of many, their young corps of pitchers were performing better than expected and remained durable as the team struggled to score runs and the losses continued to pile up - 18 in May, 22 in June - with no reason to expect any change in fortune.\n\nBy the end of May, the Tigers were 14-39, 16.5 games out of first, and their season was all but finished. On August 30, after a 5-2 loss to the White Sox, the Tigers had lost 100 games for the second straight season; furthermore, they were gaining nationwide attention as they seemed a sure bet to break the infamous 1962 Mets' record for most losses in a season.  Looking for a spark from the farm system, players were constantly being shuffled back and forth between Detroit and nearby [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], where the team's Triple-AAA affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]] played.  Unfortunately, the Mud Hens were not well-stocked, either, compounding frustrations for a team already in complete disarray.  Meanwhile, the pitching staff, which had remained remarkably intact through the first half, finally collapsed; [[Mike Maroth]] lost 21 games, the first MLB pitcher to lose 20 games in a season since [[Brian Kingman]] lost 20 for the [[1980 Oakland Athletics season|1980 Oakland Athletics]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/20gameLosers.shtml |title=20 Game Losers |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> while Jeremy Bonderman lost 19 before Trammell mercifully pulled him from the rotation with two weeks remaining.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=bondeje01&t=p&year=2003 |title=2003 Jeremy Bonderman Pitching Game Logs |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> Tigers' starters Maroth, Bonderman and [[Nate Cornejo|Cornejo]] were the top three pitchers in losses for the 2003 season, the only time in Major League history that one team had the top three losers in a season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/2003-starter-pitching.shtml |title=2003 American League Starting Pitching |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>  [[Franklyn German]] had the most saves on the team, with five in limited opportunities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/germafr01.shtml |title=Franklyn German Stats|accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>\n\nOn September 22, the Tigers had lost ten straight and 118 on the season. Just as they appeared likely to go into the record books for futility, the Tigers roared back to life and won five of their last six games to finish 43-119. While it was one game short of the 120 losses by the 1962 Mets, it was still the most losses in American League history and one of the worst seasons for a non-expansion team in modern baseball history.  The final series of the season was particularly memorable against the division champion [[Minnesota Twins]], 48 games ahead of Detroit.  The Twins sat their starters for almost all of the series in order to keep players rested for the playoffs.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/29/sports/baseball-the-tigers-are-happy-to-avoid-making-history.html</ref>  On September 27, in their next-to-last game, the Tigers came back from an 8-0 deficit to beat the Twins, 9-8 - on a strikeout wild pitch, an appropriate finish to a team that had struggled mightily all summer long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200309270.shtml |title=Sep 27, 2003, Twins at Tigers Play by Play and Box Score |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>  The Tigers then won the season finale, 9-4, to avoid tying the record and received a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nWhile the 2003 Tigers finished with the third-most losses in major league history (behind the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 Cleveland Spiders]] and 1962 Mets), they fare slightly better based on winning percentage.  \n\nAs of 2020, the 2003 Tigers rank only as the 12th worst team in history based on winning percentage (minimum 120 games), but unlike the 2003 Tigers, most of the other teams usually described as the worst of all time were plagued by significant off-field troubles:\n* The 1899 Spiders (whose owners also owned the St. Louis Browns), the 1916 and 1919 A's (who had been plagued by finanical problems) and the 1890 Alleghenys (who had almost all of their star players jump to the [[Players' League]]) had been reduced to minor league status.  \n* The 1886 Senators and Cowboys, 1889 Colonels, 1897-98 Browns, 1904 Senators and 1935 Braves were all plagued by finanical and/or ownership issues, with the Colonels and Braves ownership failing to finish out the season.\n* The 1962 Mets were a first-year expansion team. \n\nFor this reason, the 2003 Tigers have been described as being possibly \"the worst team of all time without a good excuse.\"<ref name=\"baseballgraphs.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballgraphs.com/teams/tigers.html |title=2003 Detroit Tigers Baseball Graphs Review  |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |publisher=BaseballGraphs.com }}</ref><ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/263695/lions-and-tigers-and-bobcats-the-worst-teams-in-sports-history |title=The worst teams in NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL history |accessdate=December 26, 2017 |publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nDesignated hitter/left fielder [[Dmitri Young]] was the one member of the 2003 Tigers to have a truly good year, with a .297 batting average, 29 home runs, and .537 slugging percentage. According to Win Shares, the Tigers would have had about six fewer wins without him.<ref name=\"baseballgraphs.com\"/>\n\nOn the pitching staff, [[Jamie Walker (baseball)|Jamie Walker]] stands out as the one pitcher who had a good season.  Walker appeared in 78 games (2nd most in the AL) and had an ERA of 3.32 ([[Adjusted ERA+]] of 130).\n\nSome blamed first-year manager [[Alan Trammell]] for the team's performance.  However, the 2002 team was 55-106 under manager [[Luis Pujols]] and in short, Trammell inherited a team in shambles. The Tigers did not sign any significant new talent in 2003 and lost several key players from the 2002 team, including the team's best starter, [[Jeff Weaver]], closer [[Juan Acevedo]], second baseman [[Damion Easley]], right fielder [[Robert Fick]], and designated hitter [[Randall Simon]].  [[Dean Palmer]], who had 275 career home runs, tried to resuscitate an injury-plagued career, and could not succeed at that; his career came to an end.   Even with fellow 1984 teammates [[Kirk Gibson]] and [[Lance Parrish]] on the coaching staff, Trammell could not turn the team around in 2003.\n\nAfter the 2003 season, the Tigers acquired [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Carlos Guill\u00e9n]], [[Ugueth Urbina]], and [[Rondell White]].  With the infusion of new talent, Trammell was able to lead the start of the franchise's turnaround, as the team improved to 72-90 in 2004, a 29-game improvement over the 2003 season which was the largest single-season improvement in the American League since Baltimore's 33-game improvement from 1988 to 1989.\n\nThree years after losing 119 games, the [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] went 95-67 and made it to the [[2006 World Series]].  The 2006 pennant winners featured 10 players from the 2003 team: [[Brandon Inge]], [[Ram\u00f3n Santiago]] (who spent 2004 and 2005 with the [[Seattle Mariners]]), [[Craig Monroe]], [[Omar Infante]], [[Mike Maroth]], [[Jeremy Bonderman]], [[Nate Robertson]], [[Jamie Walker (baseball)|Jamie Walker]], [[Wilfredo Ledezma]], and [[Fernando Rodney]]. (Dmitri Young was released in September 2006 following off-field issues)\n\nThe record would not be threatened until {{mlby|2018}}, when the [[2018 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] went 47-115. A year later, [[2019 Detroit Tigers season|the Tigers themselves]] would also win just 47 games, but due to a cancelled game that reduced their season to 161 games, they only had 114 losses, meaning that Baltimore had the worst team of the entire 2010s decade.\n\n===Season standings===\n{{2003 AL Central standings|highlight=Detroit Tigers}}\n\n=== Record vs. opponents ===\n{{2003 AL Record vs. opponents|team=DET}}\n\n===Roster===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #003366; color: white; text-align: center;\" | 2003 Detroit Tigers\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #bd5d29; color: white; text-align: center;\" | '''Roster'''\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | '''Pitchers'''\n*{{MLBplayer|14|[[Matt Anderson (baseball)|Matt Anderson]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|33|[[Steve Avery]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|24|[[Adam Bernero]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|38|[[Jeremy Bonderman]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|34|[[Nate Cornejo]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|36|[[Eric Eckenstahler]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|49,62|[[Franklyn Germ\u00e1n]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|55,35|[[Gary Knotts]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|41|[[Wilfredo Ledezma]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|58|[[Shane Loux]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|46|[[Mike Maroth]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|45|[[Chris Mears]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|28|[[Danny Patterson]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|59|[[Nate Robertson]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|56|[[Fernando Rodney]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|52|[[Matt Roney]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|53|[[Brian Schmack]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|37|[[Steve Sparks (pitcher, born 1965)|Steve Sparks]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|48|[[Chris Spurling]]}}\n*{{MLBplayer|32|[[Jamie Walker (baseball)|Jamie Walker]]}}\n| width=\"25px\" | \n| valign=\"top\" | '''Catchers'''\n*{{MLBplayer|26|[[A.

They finished with the most losses in [[American League]] history, and came within one loss of tying the [[1962 New York Mets season|1962 New York Mets]] for the [[List of worst MLB season records|most losses in modern major league history]].\n\nThe team went 43\u2013119, which surpassed the [[1916 Philadelphia Athletics season|1916 Philadelphia Athletics]] for the most losses in American League history. But due to a shorter season in 1916, the Athletics had a worse winning percentage and seven fewer wins (36-117 record) than the 2003 Tigers.  The Tigers were outscored by 337 runs over the course of the season (928 to 591) and finished 47 games behind the [[2003 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. Blame for the dismal season was shared by both the pitching staff, which had an ERA of 5.30, and the batters, who finished with a team batting average of .240, 19 points below the American League's .259 batting average.\n\n==Season overview==\n\nReeling off yet another losing season in [[2002 Detroit Tigers season|2002]], management found themselves in a big hole: a farm system that wasn't producing, a big-league club with major deficiencies, and contracts being paid to veterans not playing to expectations; those who did produce - [[Juan Acevedo]], [[Randall Simon]], and [[Robert Fick]], did not return for 2003.  Piloting the team was first-year manager and longtime Tiger favorite, [[Alan Trammell]], who had a dilemma nearly everywhere on the roster, particularly the starting rotation.  [[Gary Knotts]], who had pitched mostly in relief in his career,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/knottga01.shtml |title=Gary Knotts Stats |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> was to be converted to a starting role; Detroit area native [[Steve Avery]] was looking to make a comeback after not pitching in two years; two untested rookies, [[Jeremy Bonderman]] - drafted straight out of high school - and [[Nate Robertson]] - acquired in a trade for [[Mark Redman]] to the [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] - also vied for their chances to make the big-league rotation.\n\nResults were nothing short of disastrous.  The Tigers lost their first nine games, won their first against [[2003 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago]] on April 12, then proceeded to drop eight in a row to fall to 1-17.  An almost non-existent offense accounted for most of the team's early season woes, batting a paltry .228 as a team in the first half.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/tgl.cgi?team=DET&t=b&year=2003 |title=2003 Detroit Tigers Batting Log |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>  To the surprise of many, their young corps of pitchers were performing better than expected and remained durable as the team struggled to score runs and the losses continued to pile up - 18 in May, 22 in June - with no reason to expect any change in fortune.\n\nBy the end of May, the Tigers were 14-39, 16.5 games out of first, and their season was all but finished. On August 30, after a 5-2 loss to the White Sox, the Tigers had lost 100 games for the second straight season; furthermore, they were gaining nationwide attention as they seemed a sure bet to break the infamous 1962 Mets' record for most losses in a season.  Looking for a spark from the farm system, players were constantly being shuffled back and forth between Detroit and nearby [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], where the team's Triple-AAA affiliate [[Toledo Mud Hens]] played.  Unfortunately, the Mud Hens were not well-stocked, either, compounding frustrations for a team already in complete disarray.  Meanwhile, the pitching staff, which had remained remarkably intact through the first half, finally collapsed; [[Mike Maroth]] lost 21 games, the first MLB pitcher to lose 20 games in a season since [[Brian Kingman]] lost 20 for the [[1980 Oakland Athletics season|1980 Oakland Athletics]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/20gameLosers.shtml |title=20 Game Losers |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> while Jeremy Bonderman lost 19 before Trammell mercifully pulled him from the rotation with two weeks remaining.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=bondeje01&t=p&year=2003 |title=2003 Jeremy Bonderman Pitching Game Logs |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref> Tigers' starters Maroth, Bonderman and [[Nate Cornejo|Cornejo]] were the top three pitchers in losses for the 2003 season, the only time in Major League history that one team had the top three losers in a season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/2003-starter-pitching.shtml |title=2003 American League Starting Pitching |accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>  [[Franklyn German]] had the most saves on the team, with five in limited opportunities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/germafr01.shtml |title=Franklyn German Stats|accessdate=July 4, 2019 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>\n\nOn September 22, the Tigers had lost ten straight and 118 on the season. Just as they appeared likely to go into the record books for futility, the Tigers roared back to life and won five of their last six games to finish 43-119. While it was one game short of the 120 losses by the 1962 Mets, it was still the most losses in American League history and one of the worst seasons for a non-expansion team in modern baseball history.  The final series of the season was particularly memorable against the division champion [[Minnesota Twins]], 48 games ahead of Detroit.  The Twins sat their starters for almost all of the series in order to keep players rested for the playoffs.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/29/sports/baseball-the-tigers-are-happy-to-avoid-making-history.html</ref>  On September 27, in their next-to-last game, the Tigers came back from an 8-0 deficit to beat the Twins, 9-8 - on a strikeout wild pitch, an appropriate finish to a team that had struggled mightily all summer long.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET200309270.shtml |title=Sep 27, 2003, Twins at Tigers Play by Play and Box Score |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com }}</ref>  The Tigers then won the season finale, 9-4, to avoid tying the record and received a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nWhile the 2003 Tigers finished with the third-most losses in major league history (behind the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 Cleveland Spiders]] and 1962 Mets), they fare slightly better based on winning percentage.  \n\nAs of 2020, the 2003 Tigers rank only as the 12th worst team in history based on winning percentage (minimum 120 games), but unlike the 2003 Tigers, most of the other teams usually described as the worst of all time were plagued by significant off-field troubles:\n* The 1899 Spiders (whose owners also owned the St. Louis Browns), the 1916 and 1919 A's (who had been plagued by finanical problems) and the 1890 Alleghenys (who had almost all of their star players jump to the [[Players' League]]) had been reduced to minor league status.  \n* The 1886 Senators and Cowboys, 1889 Colonels, 1897-98 Browns, 1904 Senators and 1935 Braves were all plagued by finanical and/or ownership issues, with the Colonels and Braves ownership failing to finish out the season.\n* The 1962 Mets were a first-year expansion team. \n\nFor this reason, the 2003 Tigers have been described as being possibly \"the worst team of all time without a good excuse.\"<ref name=\"baseballgraphs.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballgraphs.com/teams/tigers.html |title=2003 Detroit Tigers Baseball Graphs Review  |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |publisher=BaseballGraphs.com }}</ref><ref name=\"espn.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/263695/lions-and-tigers-and-bobcats-the-worst-teams-in-sports-history |title=The worst teams in NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL history |accessdate=December 26, 2017 |publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nDesignated hitter/left fielder [[Dmitri Young]] was the one member of the 2003 Tigers to have a truly good year, with a .297 batting average, 29 home runs, and .537 slugging percentage. According to Win Shares, the Tigers would have had about six fewer wins without him.<ref name=\"baseballgraphs.com\"/>\n\nOn the pitching staff, [[Jamie Walker (baseball)|Jamie Walker]] stands out as the one pitcher who had a good season.  Walker appeared in 78 games (2nd most in the AL) and had an ERA of 3.32 ([[Adjusted ERA+]] of 130).\n\nSome blamed first-year manager [[Alan Trammell]] for the team's performance.  However, the 2002 team was 55-106 under manager [[Luis Pujols]] and in short, Trammell inherited a team in shambles. The Tigers did not sign any significant new talent in 2003 and lost several key players from the 2002 team, including the team's best starter, [[Jeff Weaver]], closer [[Juan Acevedo]], second baseman [[Damion Easley]], right fielder [[Robert Fick]], and designated hitter [[Randall Simon]].  [[Dean Palmer]], who had 275 career home runs, tried to resuscitate an injury-plagued career, and could not succeed at that; his career came to an end.   Even with fellow 1984 teammates [[Kirk Gibson]] and [[Lance Parrish]] on the coaching staff, Trammell could not turn the team around in 2003.\n\nAfter the 2003 season, the Tigers acquired [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Carlos Guill\u00e9n]], [[Ugueth Urbina]], and [[Rondell White]].  With the infusion of new talent, Trammell was able to lead the start of the franchise's turnaround, as the team improved to 72-90 in 2004, a 29-game improvement over the 2003 season which was the largest single-season improvement in the American League since Baltimore's 33-game improvement from 1988 to 1989.\n\nThree years after losing 119 games, the [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] went 95-67 and made it to the [[2006 World Series]].

{"title_page": "Armature (computer animation)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2016}}\nAn '''armature''' is the name of the [[kinematic chain]]s used in [[computer animation]] to simulate the motions of virtual human or animal characters. In the context of animation, the [[inverse kinematics]] of the armature is the most relevant computational algorithm.\n\nThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures. [[Key frame|Keyframing]] armatures were initially developed to assist in animating digital characters without basing the movement on a live performance. The animator poses a device manually for each keyframe, while the character in the animation is set up with a mechanical structure equivalent to the armature. The device is connected to the animation software through a driver program and each move is recorded for a particular frame in time. [[Digital puppetry|Real-time]] armatures are similar, but they are puppeteered by one or more people and captured in real-time.\nInside of every puppet stop motion character is an Armature. Armature fills two main functions, It must move in a human-like manner in order to give life to character animation. The inner skeletal structure must be close to human-like as possible this includes having joint and finger flexibility. Human movements also involve spinning at the elbows, knees, shoulders and hips in order to bend down and pick up something from the ground. The second job of an armature is to not move. It is necessary that armature does not move, it must have some stiffness when positioned into place. \u201cyou don't want to be in the middle of a shoot with several minutes can pass by between each shot and have the puppets slowly drooping between one shoot and the next\u201d (Justatinyamount, 2018). In built geometric movement can extend into the hands and feet. Even facial movements are available in some armature figures. \n\u201cThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures\u201d (Wikipedia Article). Both Key framing and of wax, clay or plaster. Historically, armatures were made of chicken wire, wood and many pounds of clay, making them very heavy\u201d (Computer Animation Complete, Parent, Rick).\n\n==Real-Time Puppeteering==\nReal-time Puppeteering, simply means that the character skeleton is controlled by a human animator, by \u201csimple mapping between a hardware controller (such as a gamepad, a wiimote, a custom puppet controller, or even your body with a kinect-based system) and the character\u2019s 3D animation armature\u201d (Three Real-Time Animation Methods, Hancock, Terry). Because of the nature of Puppeteering devices there is no attempt to control \u201cNatural Motion\u201d, you just simply manipulate the Digital puppet to do what you want. It takes some skill to do this like puppeteering, \u201cYou can take advantage of the puppeteer's skills, because these guys are masters. It\u2019s just amazing seeing them put their hand in a puppet and it just comes to life\u201d (\u201cComputer Animation Complete\u201d, Parent, Rick). Digital Real-Time Armature main difference, \u201cIt is controlled or we can say it is being puppets by people and the motions are captured in real time. This type of animation is used basically for 2D or 3D figures and objects created by using some 2D and 3D animation software. This type of animation armature is used for mainly filmmaking and Television production purposes. The film made using this technique is captured in real time by making the character move and capturing its live performance for the film\u201d (Virtualschooldek.com). Motions are recorded with digital software. Software such as Blender, \u201cBlender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline\u2014modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline\u201d (https://www.blender.org). This software allows the registering of data from Digital Armatures. \n\n==Types of Armatures Build==\nAction Figures can also be converted into Armatures, for instance, TV shows such as Robot Chicken use modified forms of Armature Action Figures for their show. The most common toys for Armature are Lego\u2019s, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why they look great, they stay where you put them and you can move them around a reasonable amount\u201d (Youtube Video \u201cThe 3 main types of Armature\u201d). The only setback is their range of motion so this calls for them to be modified, so aluminium wire is inserted inside of them in order for joints to have a wider range of motion that seems organic to the character. In the \u201cLego Movie\u201d, the majority of the characters were Digital Armatures. Director Chris Miller, even used his childhood Lego Toy as the main character for the entire movie; \u201cChris Miller literally brought his broken space man toy which he had since he was a little kid \u2026 That\u2019s the level of detail and realism we wanna create (Film). Armatures was not the only method used but it was a hybrid effort of techniques in order to achieve the final product. Modifications can be done on figures such as LEGOs, such as installing wire through the character in order to have a fuller range of motion. Bringing life into toys is nothing new shows such as \u201cRobot Chicken\u201d implement, Action Figure Armatures in order for iconic doll super heroes to appear on the show. \nTwisted Wire Armature is another cost-effective method used by animators, the only problem with this type of method is that joints are not strong and will lead to a drooping figure over time. Ball and Sockets Armatures have been the traditional method in which figures have been built, with a method such as this the plates inside the puppet are easily adjustable for stiffness. Balls and sockets can often be bulky so a Hybrid method between Twisted Wire Armature and Ball and Socket Armatures are created by animators in order for characters to move fluidly throughout the body. Ball and Socket Armature Kits are available for purchase, but these figures are often expensive. Descriptions for Kits include, \u201cThe Standard Armature Kit comes complete with everything you need to make your own armature. It is easy assembled and has been designed to meet most character designs. As well as double jointed ball and socket joints\u201d (Animation Supplies Website).\n\n==How armatures work==\n\u201cPuppeteering armatures are very similar to keyframing armatures, expect the motion is captured in real time as performed by one or more puppeteers.\u201d( Parent, Rick and Computer Animation Complete) Through the use of tracking markers, sensors, hand controls, and animation software, \u201cpuppeteers\u201d are able to produce an animated performance in real time. Through a live performance conducted in real time, sensors and tracking markers attached to the performer help translate their body movements into the actions and expressions that the 3D digital armature replicates in real time. Rather than using an armature model with joints and built in sensors, this type of \u201creal time\u201d animation relies on a live performer and the movements they conduct to simulate the actions the 3D digital armature will follow. Aside from the sensors attached to the live performer used to record their body movements, face trackers are also used to record the performers facial expressions in real time as well . \u201c The most popular are the real-time optical face trackers, consisting of a camera that is placed in a structure attached to the performer\u2019s head so that it moves with the performer. The device captures the motion of small markers placed in different areas of the face.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Along with the body sensors these facial trackers allow the puppets to capture the real time expression and digitally animate it. However the application of facial tracks through real time simulations has a limit when it comes to its range of detail. \u201cUnfortunately, these are 2D devices that cannot capture certain motions such as puckering of the lips, so the data is all in one plane and not very realistic. Three-dimensional facial motion data can be captured with an optical system using two or more cameras, yielding a much better result, but not in real time.\u201d ( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Aside from the use of live performers in real time armatures, digital armatures made of joints, and sensors can also be used to simulate animated movement in real time. \u201cThe last commercially available example of a digital armature was the Monkey 2 by Digital Image Design in New York City. It was modular, so it could be assembled in different joint configurations.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) With modular capabilities embedded in the armature the puppeteers are allowed to maneuver the figure and transport its actions digitally. \u201cBoth stop-motion and real time types consist of a series of rigid modules connected by joints whose rotations are measured by potentiometers or angular sensors. The sensors are usually analog devices, but they are called digital because the resulting readings are converted to digital signals to be processed by the computer system.These armatures are typically modular in order to accommodate different character designs.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) The modular design allows for these digital armature models to simulate movements that in an animated environment resemble those of a human or animal. \u201c The first-generation Monkey had a fixed configuration, which made it unusable for any non humanoid applications.\u201d(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) A modular armature helps overcome this problem and create a solid baseline that is capable of various movements and extensions. Now depending on the package contents that come with the digital armature model itself the price may vary. \u201c The typical cost for a 39-joint Monkey 2 setup was approximately $15,000, which included all the necessary parts as well as driver software for most well known animation packages.\u201d(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) Both the live performance and digital armature real time animation methods convert to digital formats allowing the puppeteers different ways to produce and create an animated visual. Through real time armatures \u201cMotus Digital\u201d is able to bring their creations to life and implement interactive settings within their animations. Through real time armature this company creates \u201cLarry the Zombie\u201d, an interactive character that they use in their business ventures. \u201cThis year Larry will take our Real-Time technology to the next level by attending the show himself, in search of \u201cThe Next Big Thing\u201d.  He will interview panelists, share his schedule and report what\u2019s going on and do whatever it takes to find the next big thing.  Unlike Elf Hotline that takes place at the \u201cNorth Pole\u201d, Larry lives in the real world and is keen on pop culture and world events.  Although the Real-Time interviews will be conducted via Skype, Larry\u2019s character will be composited into the shot giving Larry a real presence at this years South by SouthWest.\u201d( Motus Digital) Through real time armature this company shows how creative and interactive content can be created and shared with a larger audience.\n\n==Keyframing(Stop motion)==\nStop motion animation is captured one frame at a time and when they are played back it looks like movement. It is achieved by taking a picture of each individual frame and then editing it together in whatever software you may prefer. The more fluid you want the movements to look, the more frames you would need. Stop motion works just a flipbook but in a digital format. In this analogy frames would be equivalent to the pages in a flipbook, the more pages you have the more organic the movements look. Stop motion animation can be integrated into live action films or be completely animated. Live action movies like \u201cThe Terminator\u201d(1984) and \u201cRoboCop\u201d (1987) both had stop motion sequences. \n===Tim Burton: Armature Influence===\nTim Burton, a graduate from CalArts in southern california, was well aware of the stop motion techniques available to him. CalArts, founded by Walt Disney, in 1961 was innovating computer applications of armatures and other forms of computer designs.A popular example of stop motion are Tim Burton movies, his animated ones of course. \u201cNightmare before Christmas\u201d, \u201cCorpse Bride\u201d, \u201cCoraline\u201d,etc. A lot goes into making a stop motion film with the quality of a Tim Burton one. Everything you see on screen was made by someone in the crew. The set was built, the puppets were hand made and every single frame was an individual picture taken. On a behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cFrankenweenie\u201d one of the crew members shows one of their exposure sheets which is a stop motion equivalent to a shot list. The frames are broken down in phonetics(the sound a letter makes) which means it takes multiple frames to even make one word that a character may say. The crew member has to shape the puppet's mouth so that it matches every sound made in every word that the voice actor says in the dialogue. It is also mentioned in the video that even the smallest action such as blinking requires the puppets eyelids to be replaced each time. In the behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cCoraline\u201d crew members show how movement can look so fluid in stop motion by explaining the process of rigging. Rigging in stop motion is when someone uses mechanics like winding or pulling to propel a puppet or set piece through space. For example an animator may put an object on a piece of wire and move the wire in different positions and then edit the wire out in post production.  \n\tTim Burton\u2019s love for the old age technique of stop-motion animation, which has contributed a big part to its success is due to his obsession with the simple idea that this specific technique could really bring to life ideas that otherwise would be impossible. \u201cThe animation helped viewers identify with something that could not possibly exist.\u201d Burton\u2019s need to use stop-motion animation was due to the idea that \u201cit could bring something purely imagined to vivid life in a way that 2-D animation couldn\u2019t.\u201d This was amplified through his exploration with other works of art such as James Whale\u2019s Frankenstein, which helped focus on those ideas of monsters and his need to create them in his life. There is no question that Burton did exactly that with his work in The Nightmare Before Christmas which brought this technique back into the limelight. Although Burton worked with animators like John Lasseter who made Toy Story happen with computer animation he never lost focus on stop-motion animation. This helped him create amazing films such as Corps Bride and remake of his 1984 short film Frankenweenie. To no surprise Burton\u2019s original commercial for MoMA\u2019s exhibition was made with the age-old technique of stop-motion animation to honor the amazing creator. Although Tim Burton was not the original creator of this technique he was honored in part of the series to help represent the influence that his films have had on the technique. Other creators who have come before him in the field of stop-motion animation are Harryhausen \u201cthe subject of a MoMA retrospective\u2014Ray Harryhausen: Special Effects (May 28\u2013September 1, 1981)\u201d. Harryhausen who trained under Willis O\u2019Brien \u201ccreator of effects in King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949)\u201d.\n===Wes Anderson: Armature Animation Influence===\nWes Anderson is a director who primarily makes live action films but he does have two stop motion animated movies \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d and \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d. Although these films are animated they still show Wes Anderson\u2019s signature style. In a behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d it\u2019s shown that animators used actual movement as a reference. They had real dogs on set so that they could have something to base their animation on. Also animators would film themselves walking or doing any action that they need to animate and then they would look at it when animating a human puppet. This helped them to make action look more fluid and realistic because they were using themselves as a reference. \n===History of Stop Motion===\nStop motion started in the late 1800s. The first ever Stop-motion film was released in 1898 \u201cThe Humpty Dumpty Circus\u201d created by J. Stuart Black and Albert E. Smith. It was popularized by the animator Willis O\u2019 Brien who mixed stop motion with live actors. His best known work was \u201cKing Kong\u201d(1933). In 1940 animator George Pal developed a technique called \u201creplacement animation\u201d. Instead of using clay or any other malleable material to change the puppet he created multiple wooden heads, each with a different facial expression and replaced the heads when conveying different emotions. In 1944 George Pal won an Oscar for this technique. In 1955 Art Clokey, a pioneer in claymation(stop motion with clay figures), created \u201cGumby\u201d for \u201cThe Howdy Doody Show\u201d. In 1961 he also created the children\u2019s show \u201cDavey and Goliath\u201d which was sponsored by the Lutheran Church.\n===Claymation===\nClaymation is a very popular type of Stop motion animation used by many different creators. Pioneered by Art Clokey as mentioned in the previous section, Claymation is still used by modern day animators. It was used by Tim Burton and Henry Selick in films like \u201cParaNorman\u201d \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Nightmare before Christmas\u201d. Director and animator Nick Park also used claymation in all of his \u201cChicken Run\u201d and \u201cWallace and Gromit\u201d movies. Rankin/Bass Productions Inc. also used claymation in Christmas special movies like \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\u201d(1964) and \u201cJack Frost\u201d(1979) both in which air on the network NBC. Although all of these films use clay and stop motion animation, they each have their own unique look and style. Claymation has evolved throughout the years because all creators have their own vision and clay is so malleable that it could make endless styles of characters and scenery. moving clay. In this technique pieces of clay are moulded to create characters and based on the imagination of the animator, a story is unfolded. There are oil based and water based clays available. Sometimes the clay is moulded into free forms or filled up in a wire like structure called armature. The animated characters are kept in a set and with only short movements, the whole scene is film. Famous examples of this technique being used are, Missing Link by Chris Butler , Kubo and the two strings by Travis Andrew Knight, Coraline by Charles Henry Selick, The Boxtrolls by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. \n==Other Animations techniques==\nStop motion: The illusion of movement achieved by moving a figure in tiny increments between each photographed frame\nObject-Motion: moving or animating objects, this is a form of stop motion animation that uses physical items instead of drawn objects which are not meant to be a human or recognizable character. \nPuppet Animation: moving puppets, a unique phenomenon. It's born out of the hard work of its pioneers and their followers to bring creative impulses to life by experimenting with new technologie. in cinema a great example of this technique being used is in the film King Kong (1933). The writer/director Tim Burton often uses puppet animation in his work for example, Corpse Bride (2005) which is a stop motion animated horror musical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ref>{{cite book| title=Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Video Games| last=Menache| first=Alberto| date=2000| publisher=Morgan Kaufmann| ISBN=9780124906303}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Linkage (mechanical)|Linkages]]\n* [[Skeletal animation]]\n\n==References==\nSources \nhttps://www.techopedia.com/definition/109/stop-motion-animation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUFkjD9_QPQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXqqd0ZBEMA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZcZfES8EEE\nhttps://www.thewrap.com/a-timeline-of-stop-motion-animation-history-from-a-trip-to-the-moon-to-isle-of-dogs-photos/\n\n\nMenache, Alberto.

In the context of animation, the [[inverse kinematics]] of the armature is the most relevant computational algorithm.\n\nThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures. [[Key frame|Keyframing]] armatures were initially developed to assist in animating digital characters without basing the movement on a live performance. The animator poses a device manually for each keyframe, while the character in the animation is set up with a mechanical structure equivalent to the armature. The device is connected to the animation software through a driver program and each move is recorded for a particular frame in time. [[Digital puppetry|Real-time]] armatures are similar, but they are puppeteered by one or more people and captured in real-time.\nInside of every puppet stop motion character is an Armature. Armature fills two main functions, It must move in a human-like manner in order to give life to character animation. The inner skeletal structure must be close to human-like as possible this includes having joint and finger flexibility. Human movements also involve spinning at the elbows, knees, shoulders and hips in order to bend down and pick up something from the ground. The second job of an armature is to not move. It is necessary that armature does not move, it must have some stiffness when positioned into place. \u201cyou don't want to be in the middle of a shoot with several minutes can pass by between each shot and have the puppets slowly drooping between one shoot and the next\u201d (Justatinyamount, 2018). In built geometric movement can extend into the hands and feet. Even facial movements are available in some armature figures. \n\u201cThere are two types of digital armatures: Keyframing (stop-motion) armatures and real-time (puppeteering) armatures\u201d (Wikipedia Article). Both Key framing and  methods consist of a series of connected joints and angular sensors in which they give \u201cDigital\u201d information to a computer. Armatures are described as, \u201cA structure that provides the base to the final layer of wax, clay or plaster. Historically, armatures were made of chicken wire, wood and many pounds of clay, making them very heavy\u201d (Computer Animation Complete, Parent, Rick).\n==Real-Time Puppeteering==\nReal-time Puppeteering, simply means that the character skeleton is controlled by a human animator, by \u201csimple mapping between a hardware controller (such as a gamepad, a wiimote, a custom puppet controller, or even your body with a kinect based system) and the character\u2019s 3D animation armature\u201d (Three Real-Time Animation Methods, Hancock, Terry). Because of the nature of Puppeteering devices there is no attempt to control \u201cNatural Motion\u201d, you just simply manipulate the Digital puppet to do what you want. It takes some skill to do this like puppeteering, \u201cYou can take advantage of the puppeteer's skills, because these guys are masters. It\u2019s just amazing seeing them put their hand in a puppet and it just comes to life\u201d (\u201cComputer Animation Complete\u201d, Parent, Rick). Digital Real-Time Armature main difference, \u201cIt is controlled or we can say it is being puppets by people and the motions are captured in real time. This type of animation is used basically for 2D or 3D figures and objects created by using some 2D and 3D animation software. This type of animation armature is used for mainly filmmaking and Television production purposes. The film made using this technique is captured in real time by making the character move and capturing its live performance for the film\u201d (Virtualschooldek.com). Motions are recorded with digital software. Software such as Blender, \u201cBlender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline\u2014modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline\u201d (https://www.blender.org). This software allows the registering of data from Digital Armatures. \n==Types of Armatures Build==\nAction Figures can also be converted into Armatures, for instance TV Shows such as Robot Chicken use modified forms of Armature Action Figures for their show. The most common toys for Armature are Lego\u2019s, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see why they look great, they stay where you put them and you can move them around a reasonable amount\u201d (Youtube Video \u201cThe 3 main types of Armature\u201d). The only setback is their range of motion so this calls for them to be modified, so aluminium wire is inserted inside of them in order for joints to have a wider range of motion that seems organic to the character. In the \u201cLego Movie\u201d, the majority of the characters were Digital Armatures. Director Chris Miller, even used his childhood Lego Toy as the main character for the entire movie; \u201cChris Miller literally brought his broken space man toy which he had since he was a little kid \u2026 That\u2019s the level of detail and realism we wanna create (Film). Armatures was not the only method used but it was a hybrid effort of techniques in order to achieve the final product. Modifications can be done on figures such as LEGOs, such as installing wire through the character in order to have a fuller range of motion. Bringing life into toys is nothing new shows such as \u201cRobot Chicken\u201d implement, Action Figure Armatures in order for iconic doll super heroes to appear on the show. \nTwisted Wire Armature is another cost effective method used by animators, the only problem with this type of method is that joints are not strong and will lead to a drooping figure over time. Ball and Sockets Armatures have been the traditional method in which figures have been built, with a method such as this the plates inside the puppet are easily adjustable for stiffness. Balls and sockets can often be bulky so a Hybrid method between Twisted Wire Armature and Ball and Socket Armatures are created by animators in order for characters to move fluidly throughout the body. Ball and Socket Armature Kits are available for purchase, but these figures are often expensive. Descriptions for Kits include, \u201cThe Standard Armature Kit comes complete with everything you need to make your own armature. It is easy assembled and has been designed to meet most character designs. As well as double jointed ball and socket joints\u201d (Animation Supplies Website).\n==How Armatures Work==\n\u201cPuppeteering armatures are very similar to keyframing armatures, expect the motion is captured in real time as performed by one or more puppeteers.\u201d( Parent, Rick and Computer Animation Complete) Through the use of tracking markers, sensors, hand controls, and animation software, \u201cpuppeteers\u201d are able to produce an animated performance in real time. Through a live performance conducted in real time, sensors and tracking markers attached to the performer help translate their body movements into the actions and expressions that the 3D digital armature replicates in real time. Rather than using an armature model with joints and built in sensors, this type of \u201creal time\u201d animation relies on a live performer and the movements they conduct to simulate the actions the 3D digital armature will follow. Aside from the sensors attached to the live performer used to record their body movements, face trackers are also used to record the performers facial expressions in real time as well . \u201c The most popular are the real-time optical face trackers, consisting of a camera that is placed in a structure attached to the performer\u2019s head so that it moves with the performer. The device captures the motion of small markers placed in different areas of the face.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Along with the body sensors these facial trackers allow the puppets to capture the real time expression and digitally animate it. However the application of facial tracks through real time simulations has a limit when it comes to its range of detail. \u201cUnfortunately, these are 2D devices that cannot capture certain motions such as puckering of the lips, so the data is all in one plane and not very realistic. Three-dimensional facial motion data can be captured with an optical system using two or more cameras, yielding a much better result, but not in real time.\u201d ( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto). Aside from the use of live performers in real time armatures, digital armatures made of joints, and sensors can also be used to simulate animated movement in real time. \u201cThe last commercially available example of a digital armature was the Monkey 2 by Digital Image Design in New York City. It was modular, so it could be assembled in different joint configurations.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) With modular capabilities embedded in the armature the puppeteers are allowed to maneuver the figure and transport it\u2019s actions digitally. \u201cBoth stop-motion and real time types consist of a series of rigid modules connected by joints whose rotations are measured by potentiometers or angular sensors. The sensors are usually analog devices, but they are called digital because the resulting readings are converted to digital signals to be processed by the computer system.These armatures are typically modular in order to accommodate different character designs.\u201d( Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) The modular design allows for these digital armature models to simulate movements that in an animated environment resemble those of a human or animal. \u201c The first-generation Monkey had a fixed configuration, which made it unusable for any non humanoid applications.\u201d(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) A modular armature helps overcome this problem and create a solid baseline that is capable of various movements and extensions. Now depending on the package contents that come with the digital armature model itself the price may vary. \u201c The typical cost for a 39-joint Monkey 2 setup was approximately $15,000, which included all the necessary parts as well as driver software for most well known animation packages.\u201d(Understanding Motion Capture for Computer Animation and Menache, Alberto) Both the live performance and digital armature real time animation methods convert to digital formats allowing the puppeteers different ways to produce and create an animated visual. Through real time armatures \u201cMotus Digital\u201d is able to bring their creations to life and implement interactive settings within their animations. Through real time armature this company creates \u201cLarry the Zombie\u201d, an interactive character that they use in their business ventures. \u201cThis year Larry will take our Real-Time technology to the next level by attending the show himself, in search of \u201cThe Next Big Thing\u201d.  He will interview panelists, share his schedule and report what\u2019s going on and do whatever it takes to find the next big thing.  Unlike Elf Hotline that takes place at the \u201cNorth Pole\u201d, Larry lives in the real world and is keen on pop culture and world events.  Although the Real-Time interviews will be conducted via Skype, Larry\u2019s character will be composited into the shot giving Larry a real presence at this years South by SouthWest.\u201d( Motus Digital) Through real time armature this company shows how creative and interactive content can be created and shared with a larger audience.\n==Keyframing(Stop motion)==\nStop motion animation is captured one frame at a time and when they are played back it looks like movement. It is achieved by taking a picture of each individual frame and then editing it together in whatever software you may prefer. The more fluid you want the movements to look, the more frames you would need. Stop motion works just a flipbook but in a digital format. In this analogy frames would be equivalent to the pages in a flipbook, the more pages you have the more organic the movements look. Stop motion animation can be integrated into live action films or be completely animated. Live action movies like \u201cThe Terminator\u201d(1984) and \u201cRoboCop\u201d (1987) both had stop motion sequences. \n===Tim Burton: Armature Influence===\nTim Burton, a graduate from CalArts in southern california, was well aware of the stop motion techniques available to him. CalArts, founded by Walt Disney, in 1961 was innovating computer applications of armatures and other forms of computer designs.A popular example of stop motion are Tim Burton movies, his animated ones of course. \u201cNightmare before Christmas\u201d, \u201cCorpse Bride\u201d, \u201cCoraline\u201d,etc. A lot goes into making a stop motion film with the quality of a Tim Burton one. Everything you see on screen was made by someone in the crew. The set was built, the puppets were hand made and every single frame was an individual picture taken. On a behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cFrankenweenie\u201d one of the crew members shows one of their exposure sheets which is a stop motion equivalent to a shot list. The frames are broken down in phonetics(the sound a letter makes) which means it takes multiple frames to even make one word that a character may say. The crew member has to shape the puppet's mouth so that it matches every sound made in every word that the voice actor says in the dialogue. It is also mentioned in the video that even the smallest action such as blinking requires the puppets eyelids to be replaced each time. In the behind the scenes video for the movie \u201cCoraline\u201d crew members show how movement can look so fluid in stop motion by explaining the process of rigging. Rigging in stop motion is when someone uses mechanics like winding or pulling to propel a puppet or set piece through space. For example an animator may put an object on a piece of wire and move the wire in different positions and then edit the wire out in post production.  \n\tTim Burton\u2019s love for the old age technique of stop-motion animation, which has contributed a big part to its success is due to his obsession with the simple idea that this specific technique could really bring to life ideas that otherwise would be impossible. \u201cThe animation helped viewers identify with something that could not possibly exist.\u201d Burton\u2019s need to use stop-motion animation was due to the idea that \u201cit could bring something purely imagined to vivid life in a way that 2-D animation couldn\u2019t.\u201d This was amplified through his exploration with other works of art such as James Whale\u2019s Frankenstein, which helped focus on those ideas of monsters and his need to create them in his life.
