In Vancouver, Oberlander became interested in the modern art movement led by [[B.C. Binning]] and Ned Pratt, which combined art and architecture to address the connections between urbanism and surrounding natural settings. In 1999\u20132000, she contributed her expertise to the Vancouver Art Gallery's Out of This Century exhibition, guiding patrons through the selection of visual art pieces that were chosen from the gallery's permanent collection (by Oberlander and five other Vancouverites) to reflect and represent the city's art scene through the decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|title = Architecture meets art in new exhibit|date = 1999-12-27|accessdate = 2015-03-08|website = North Shore News|publisher = |last = Christensen|first = Layne|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031129180138/http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|archivedate = 2003-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of Oberlander's career were dedicated to designing landscapes for low-income housing projects and playgrounds, the most famous of which is the Canadian Government Pavilion, Children's Creative Centre & play area for [[Expo 67]] in Montreal.<ref name=\"Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Archive\">[https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/218037/cornelia-hahn-oberlander-fonds Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Fonds] Retrieved 2020-04-14.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oberlander|first=Cornelia Hahn|year=1966|title=Space for Creative Play|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/98626676/Space-for-Creative-Play?ad_group=&campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&content=10079&irgwc=1&keyword=ft750noi&medium=affiliate&source=impactradius|journal=Journal of Canadian Landscape Architects|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Her first playground, for a 1951 public housing project for architect [[Louis Kahn]], included a vegetable garden and a fruit tree.

Before beginning a project she researches it thoroughly to ensure that her innovative schemes will also be practical and long-lasting.  Oberlander always approaches a project from an environmental standpoint, stating in her Convocation Address for the acceptance of an honorary degree from [[Simon Fraser University]]:\n \n<blockquote>I dream of Green Cities with Green Buildings where rural and urban activities live in harmony.[...] \"Achieving a fit\" between the built form and the land has been my dictum. This can only be done if all our design-related professions collaborate and thereby demonstrate co-operatively their relevance in meeting the enormous developmental challenges facing our increasingly crowded urban regions.<ref>[https://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/hdrspeeches/ SFU honorary degree recipients' convocation addresses]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHer concern for the environment and for people in general is further exemplified by her involvement with the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] on Mount Scopus. Oberlander and her husband, Peter, visited Israel for a congress with the International Federation of Landscape Architects in 1962. According to the ''Jewish Independent'', the Oberlanders were in Israel to study irrigation systems but they \"fell more deeply in love with the land and its people.\"<ref name=\"Jewish\">{{Cite web|url = http://jewishbulletin.ca/Archives/Feb04/archives04Feb13-01.html|title = Honors for Oberlanders|date = February 13, 2004|accessdate = |website = Jewish Independent|publisher = |last = Berger|first = Kyle|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060203071144/http://jewishbulletin.ca/Archives/Feb04/archives04Feb13-01.html|archivedate = 2006-02-03}}</ref> The Oberlanders engaged in and spearheaded many activities to benefit the university from 1979 on, including: setting up a Canadian Studies Program, bringing boxes of Canadian textbooks to Israel for donation to the university, developing a botanical garden, working with a team of planners to assist the community of Ashkalon in accommodating settlers from North Africa and Georgia, and advocating the restoration of historic buildings on the campus.

In Vancouver, Oberlander became interested in the modern art movement led by [[B.C. Binning]] and Ned Pratt, which combined art and architecture to address the connections between urbanism and surrounding natural settings. In 1999\u20132000, she contributed her expertise to the Vancouver Art Gallery's Out of This Century exhibition, guiding patrons through the selection of visual art pieces that were chosen from the gallery's permanent collection (by Oberlander and five other Vancouverites) to reflect and represent the city's art scene through the decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|title = Architecture meets art in new exhibit|date = 1999-12-27|accessdate = 2015-03-08|website = North Shore News|publisher = |last = Christensen|first = Layne|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031129180138/http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|archivedate = 2003-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of Oberlander's career were dedicated to designing landscapes for low-income housing projects and playgrounds, the most famous of which is the Canadian Government Pavilion, Children's Creative Centre & play area for [[Expo 67]] in Montreal.<ref name=\"Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Archive\">[http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/453-cornelia-hahn-oberlander-archive Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181232/http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/453-cornelia-hahn-oberlander-archive |date=2016-03-03 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oberlander|first=Cornelia Hahn|year=1966|title=Space for Creative Play|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/98626676/Space-for-Creative-Play?ad_group=&campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&content=10079&irgwc=1&keyword=ft750noi&medium=affiliate&source=impactradius|journal=Journal of Canadian Landscape Architects|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Her first playground, for a 1951 public housing project for architect [[Louis Kahn]], included a vegetable garden and a fruit tree.

That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.<ref>{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43\u201386}}</ref>\n\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\",<ref>{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}</ref> once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].\n\n===Mertonian norms===\n{{Main|Mertonian norms}}\nDuring 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five \"norms\" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:\n* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.\n* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.\n* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.\n* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.\n* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.<ref name=\"Paradigms Lost\">{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. |authorlink=John Casti |name-list-format=vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 51\u201352] |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 }}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to acknowledge problems===\nDuring 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.<ref>{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}</ref> During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.<ref>{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}</ref> The 2018 book ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe (book)|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology.

The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].\n\n[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\"/> First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations.

But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.<br /><br />\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.<ref name=Imre-Lakatos/>|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}\n\nThe boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.<ref name=\"Cover_Curd_1998\"/><ref>{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219\u2013225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}\n</ref> The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history.

To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.<ref name=Newbold>{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324\u201330 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}</ref>|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|\"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory\" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.<ref>e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3\u20135 ff}}</ref> These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results.

That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other.<ref>{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43\u201386}}</ref>\n\nAnother example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. Whatever test one thinks can be devised, there is a reason why it does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; \"Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?\". He states that \"your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true\",<ref>{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}</ref> once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].\n\n===Mertonian norms===\n{{Main|Mertonian norms}}\nDuring 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five \"norms\" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:\n* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.\n* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.\n* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.\n* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.\n* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.<ref name=\"Paradigms Lost\">{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. |authorlink=John Casti |name-list-format=vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 51\u201352] |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/paradigmslost00jlca/page/51 }}</ref>\n\n===Refusal to acknowledge problems===\nDuring 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.<ref>{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}</ref> During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of \"belief fields\" and \"research fields\" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.<ref>{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}</ref> The 2018 book ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe (book)|The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'' lists hostility to criticism as one of the major features of pseudoscience.<ref>Novella, Steven, et al.

It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.<ref name=\"Popper\"/>\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main|Demarcation problem}}\n\nKarl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]] (such as the philosophical question of what [[existence]] means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the [[Empiricism|empirical method]], which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\">{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl |name-list-format= vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1963 |title= Conjectures and Refutations |url= http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |ref= harv |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171013124349/http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |archivedate= 13 October 2017 }}</ref> He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.\n\nTo demonstrate this point, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: \"that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness. In contrast, Popper<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted \"light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, \"If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted.\"<ref name=\"Popper, Karl 1963\"/> Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].\n\n[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\"/> First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.<ref name=\"Thagard 1978 astrology\">{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience.

But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.<br /><br />\nThus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it.

The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence.

A candidate with this property, the ''pairwise champion'' or ''beats-all winner'', is formally called the ''Condorcet winner''.<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003550000071 Condorcet efficiency: A preference for indifference \"The Condorcet winner in an election is the candidate who would be able to defeat all other candidates in a series of pairwise elections.\"</ref>\n\nA Condorcet winner might not always exist in a particular election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can possibly be cyclic \u2014 that is, it is possible (but very rare) that each candidate has an opponent that defeats them in a two-candidate contest. <ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30022874?seq=1 Condorcet's Paradox and Anonymous Preference Profiles \"Condorcet's paradox [6] of simple majority voting occurs in a voting situation [...] if for every alternative there is a second alternative which more voters prefer to the first alternative than conversely.\" </ref>(This is similar to the game [[rock paper scissors]], where each hand shape wins against only one opponent and loses to another). The possibility of such cyclic preferences in a group of voters is known as the [[Condorcet paradox]]. However, there always exists a smallest group of candidates preferred by more voters than any others, known as the [[Smith set]], which is guaranteed to only have the Condorcet winner in it when one exists; some voting methods which guarantee the election of the Condorcet winner don't always elect a candidate from the Smith set. Voting methods that do so are said to be \"Smith-efficient\". <ref> http://pj.freefaculty.org/Papers/Ukraine/PJ3_VotingSystemsEssay.pdf Voting Systems \"Formally, the Smith set is defined as the smaller of two sets:\n1. The set of all alternatives, X.\n2. A subset A \u2282 X such that each member of A can defeat every member of X that is\n36\nnot in A, which we call B=X \u2212 A.\"</ref>Smith-efficient Condorcet methods only differ when picking a winner when there is no Condorcet winner on which member of the Smith set they pick, with most agreeing when there are 3 or fewer candidates in the Smith set. For example, Schulze and Ranked pairs always give the same results when the Smith set has 3 candidates with no pairwise ties between them (because these methods pass [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives|ISDA]], so all candidates not in the Smith set can be eliminated, and then for Schulze, dropping the weakest defeat yields only one pairwise victory, while with Ranked Pairs, once the first two strongest defeats are locked in, the weakest can't, since it'd create a cycle). The Condorcet winner is also usually but not necessarily the [[Utility|utilitarian]] winner (the one which maximizes [[Social welfare function|social welfare]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pivato|first=Marcus|date=2015-08-01|title=Condorcet meets Bentham|url= |journal=Journal of Mathematical Economics|volume=59|pages=58\u201365|doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2015.04.006|quote=Indeed, it is easy to construct examples where the Condorcet winner does not maximize social welfare [...however...] in a large population satisfying certain statistical regularities, not only is the Condorcet winner almost guaranteed to exist, but it is almost guaranteed to also be the utilitarian social choice.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lehtinen|first=Aki|date=2007-08-01|title=The Welfare Consequences of Strategic Voting in Two Commonly Used Parliamentary Agendas|journal=Theory and Decision|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1\u201340|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9028-4|issn=0040-5833|quote=If the CW is not the same alternative as the utilitarian winner (UW), the latter ought to be selected according to the utilitarian welfare criterion|citeseerx=10.1.1.727.3928}}</ref> \n\nCondorcet voting methods are named for the 18th-century French [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], who championed such voting systems.

A voter's ranking is often called their ''order of preference,'' although it may not match their sincere order of preference since voters are free to rank in any order they choose and may have strategic reasons to misrepresent preferences. The votes can be tallied in many ways to find a winner. Some - the Condorcet methods - will elect the Condorcet winner if there is one. They can also elect a winner when there is no Condorcet winner, and different Condorcet-compliant methods may elect different winners in the case of a cycle - Condorcet methods differ on which other criteria they satisfy.\n\nThe procedure given in [[Robert's Rules of Order]] for voting on motions and amendments is also a Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by expressing their orders of preference.<ref> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01789561 Did Jefferson or Madison understand Condorcet's theory of social choice? \"Binary procedures of the Jefferson/Robert variety will select the Condorcet winner if one exists\"</ref> There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is between two of the alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing survives to be paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is analogous to a single-winner tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert's Rules. But this method cannot reveal a [[voting paradox]] in which there is no Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an early loser over the eventual winner. A considerable portion of the literature on social choice theory is about the properties of this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments to administer; however, these shortcomings could be overcome by asking voters to select preference order from a predetermined list of preference orders. For example where there are candidates A, B and C, there are six orders of preference, so voters could be asked to choose which of the six they wish to vote for. Counting would then be simply a matter of counting how votes were cast for each order of preference. The results could then be applied to a simple spreadsheet which revealed the Condorcet winner. If there were four candidates (options) then there would be 24 orders of preference; if there were five candidates then there would be 120 orders of preference and so on.\n\n==Summary==\nIn a contest between candidates A and B run using the preferential-vote form of Condorcet method, if more voters mark their ballots that they prefer candidate A over candidate B than the number of voters who mark their ballots to the contrary, then Candidate B is not (supposed to be) elected.\n\nHowever, because of the possibility of the [[Condorcet paradox]], it is possible, but unlikely,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Voting paradoxes and group coherence : the condorcet efficiency of voting rules|last=Gehrlein, William V.|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=Lepelley, Dominique.|isbn=9783642031076|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=695387286|quote=empirical studies ... indicate that some of the most common paradoxes are relatively unlikely to be observed in actual elections. ... it is easily concluded that Condorcet\u2019s Paradox should very rarely be observed in any real elections on a small number of candidates with large electorates, as long as voters\u2019 preferences reflect any reasonable degree of group mutual coherence}}</ref> that this objective cannot be realized in a specific election. This is sometimes called a ''Condorcet cycle'' or just ''cycle'' and can be thought of as [[rock paper scissors|Candidate Rock beating Candidate Scissors, Candidate Scissors beating Candidate Paper, and Candidate Paper beating Candidate Rock]]. It is only in how the various Condorcet methods resolve such a cycle that they effectively differ (though most elections do not have cycles; see [[Condorcet paradox#Likelihood of the paradox]] for estimates). If there is no cycle, all Condorcet methods elect the same candidate and are operationally equivalent.\n\n*Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference (top-to-bottom, or best-to-worst, or 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The voter may be allowed to rank candidates as equals, to express indifference between them. To save time, candidates omitted by a voter may be treated as if the voter ranked them at the bottom.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n*For each pairing of candidates (as in a [[round-robin tournament]]) count how many votes rank each candidate over the other candidate. Thus each pairing will have two totals: the size of its majority and the size of its minority.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nFor most Condorcet methods, those counts usually suffice to determine the complete order of finish. They always suffice to determine whether there is a Condorcet winner. Additional information may be needed in the event of ties. Ties can be pairings that have no majority, or they can be majorities that are the same size; these ties will be rare when there are many voters. Some Condorcet methods may have other kinds of ties; for example, it would not be rare for two or more candidates to win the same number of pairings, when there is no Condorcet winner.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Definition==\nA Condorcet method is a voting system that will always elect the Condorcet winner (if there is one); this is the candidate whom voters prefer to each other candidate, when compared to them one at a time. This candidate can be found (if they exist; see next paragraph) by conducting a series of pairwise comparisons, using the procedure given in Robert's Rules of Order, described above. For ''N'' candidates, this requires ''N'' - 1 pairwise hypothetical elections. For example, with 5 candidates there are 4 pairwise comparisons to be made, since after each comparison, a candidate is eliminated, and after 4 eliminations, only one of the original 5 candidates will remain. \n\nTo confirm that a Condorcet winner exists in a given election, first do the above procedure, declare the final remaining candidate the procedure's winner, \"un-eliminate\" all eliminated candidates, and then do at most an additional ''N'' - 2 pairwise comparisons between the procedure's winner and any candidates they haven't been compared against yet. If the procedure's winner doesn't win all pairwise matchups, then no Condorcet winner exists in the election. \n\nNote that computing the entire pairwise matrix requires \u00bd''N''(''N''\u22121) pairwise comparisons for ''N'' candidates. \n\nThe family of Condorcet methods is also referred to collectively as Condorcet's method. A voting system that always elects the Condorcet winner when there is one is described by electoral scientists as a system that satisfies the Condorcet criterion.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn certain circumstances, an election has no Condorcet winner. This occurs as a result of a kind of tie known as a ''majority rule cycle'', described by [[Voting paradox|Condorcet's paradox]]. The manner in which a winner is then chosen varies from one Condorcet method to another. Some Condorcet methods involve the basic procedure described below, coupled with a Condorcet completion method, which is used to find a winner when there is no Condorcet winner. Other Condorcet methods involve an entirely different system of counting, but are classified as Condorcet methods because they will still elect the Condorcet winner if there is one.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIt is important to note that not all single winner, [[ranked voting systems]] are Condorcet methods. For example, [[instant-runoff voting]] and the [[Borda count]] are not Condorcet methods.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Basic procedure==\n\n===Voting===\n\nIn a Condorcet election the voter ranks the list of candidates in order of preference. So, for example, the voter gives a \"1\" to their first preference, a \"2\" to their second preference, and so on. In this respect it is the same as an election held under non-Condorcet methods such as [[instant-runoff voting]] or the [[single transferable vote]]. Some Condorcet methods allow voters to rank more than one candidate equally, so that, for example, the voter might express two first preferences rather than just one.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} It is possible to instead allow voters to rate the candidates on a scale, similar to [[Score voting]].\n\nUsually, when a voter does not give a full list of preferences they are assumed, for the purpose of the count, to prefer the candidates they have ranked over all other candidates. Some Condorcet elections permit [[write-in candidate]]s but, because this can be difficult to implement, software designed for conducting Condorcet elections often does not allow this option.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Finding the winner===\n\nThe count is conducted by pitting every candidate against every other candidate in a series of hypothetical one-on-one contests. The winner of each pairing is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. Unless they tie, there is always a majority when there are only two choices. The candidate preferred by each voter is taken to be the one in the pair that the voter ranks (or rates) higher on their ballot paper. For example, if Alice is paired against Bob it is necessary to count both the number of voters who have ranked Alice higher than Bob, and the number who have ranked Bob higher than Alice. If Alice is preferred by more voters then she is the winner of that pairing. When all possible pairings of candidates have been considered, if one candidate beats every other candidate in these contests then they are declared the Condorcet winner. As noted above, if there is no Condorcet winner a further method must be used to find the winner of the election, and this mechanism varies from one Condorcet method to another.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In any Condorcet method that passes [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives]], it can help to identify the [[Smith set]] from the head-to-head matchups (by looking for a smallest group of candidates who beat all candidates not in the group), and eliminate all candidates not in the set before doing the procedure.\n\n===Pairwise counting and matrices===\n\nCondorcet methods use pairwise counting. For each possible pair of candidates, one pairwise count indicates how many voters prefer one of the paired candidates over the other candidate, and another pairwise count indicates how many voters have the opposite preference. The counts for all possible pairs of candidates summarize all the preferences of all the voters.\n\nPairwise counts are often displayed in a ''pairwise comparison matrix''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2U8jd2AJkEC&lpg=PA6&pg=PA6|title=Democracy defended|last=Mackie, Gerry.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0511062648|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=6|oclc=252507400}}</ref> or ''outranking matrix''<ref>{{Citation|last=Nurmi|first=Hannu|chapter=On the Relevance of Theoretical Results to Voting System Choice|date=2012|pages=255\u2013274|editor-last=Felsenthal|editor-first=Dan S.|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-20441-8_10|isbn=9783642204401|editor2-last=Machover|editor2-first=Mosh\u00e9|title=Electoral Systems|series=Studies in Choice and Welfare|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f8cb5311f6e040e674c6fd80f17382a0e4bc5ed8}}</ref> such as those below.

Each ballot can be transformed into this style of matrix, and then added to all other ballot matrices using [[matrix addition]]. The sum of all ballots in an election is called the sum matrix.\n\nSuppose that in the imaginary election there are two other voters. Their preferences are (D, A, C, B) and (A, C, B, D). Added to the first voter, these ballots would give the following sum matrix:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:13em;margin:auto;text-align:center\"\n! {{diagonal split header|Runner|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opponent}} !! A !! B !! C !! D\n|-\n! A\n|| \u2014\n|| 2 || 2 || 2\n|-\n! B\n|| 1 || \u2014 || 1 || 2\n|-\n! C\n|| 1 || 2 || \u2014 || 2\n|-\n! D\n|| 1 || 1 || 1 || \u2014\n|}\n\nWhen the sum matrix is found, the contest between each pair of candidates is considered. The number of votes for runner over opponent (runner,opponent) is compared with the number of votes for opponent over runner (opponent,runner) to find the Condorcet winner. In the sum matrix above, A is the Condorcet winner because A beats every other candidate. When there is no Condorcet winner Condorcet completion methods, such as Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, use the information contained in the sum matrix to choose a winner.\n\nCells marked '\u2014' in the matrices above have a numerical value of '0', but a dash is used since candidates are never preferred to themselves. The first matrix, that represents a single ballot, is inversely symmetric: (runner,opponent) is \u00ac(opponent,runner). Or (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = 1. The sum matrix has this property: (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = N for N voters, if all runners were fully ranked by each voter.\n\n==Example: Voting on the location of Tennessee's capital==\n{{Tenn voting example}}\n\nTo find the Condorcet winner every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of imaginary one-on-one contests. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. When results for every possible pairing have been found they are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pair !! Winner\n|-\n| Memphis (42%) vs. Nashville (58%)|| Nashville\n|-\n| Memphis (42%) vs. Chattanooga (58%)|| Chattanooga\n|-\n| Memphis (42%) vs. Knoxville (58%)|| Knoxville\n|-\n| Nashville (68%) vs. Chattanooga (32%)|| Nashville\n|-\n| Nashville (68%) vs. Knoxville (32%)||Nashville\n|-\n| Chattanooga (83%) vs. Knoxville (17%)|| Chattanooga\n|}\n\nThe results can also be shown in the form of a matrix:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #ccffcc\" | Nashville [N]\n|3 Wins \u2193\n|-\n!2nd\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #ddddff\" | Chattanooga [C]\n|1 Loss \u2192\n\u2193 2 Wins\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [N] 68%<br>[C] 32%\n|-\n!3rd\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffeedd\" | Knoxville [K]\n|2 Losses \u2192\n\u2193 1 Win\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [C] 83% <br>[K] 17%\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [N] 68% <br>[K] 32%\n|-\n!4th\n! style=\"background: #ffdddd\" | Memphis [M]\n|3 Losses \u2192\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [K] 58% <br>[M] 42%\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [C] 58% <br>[M] 42%\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [N] 58% <br>[M] 42%\n|}\n\n* \n*\n*\n\nAs can be seen from both of the tables above, Nashville beats every other candidate. This means that Nashville is the Condorcet winner. Nashville will thus win an election held under any possible Condorcet method.\n\nWhile any Condorcet method will elect Nashville as the winner, if instead an election based on the same votes were held using [[first-past-the-post]] or [[instant-runoff voting]], these systems would select Memphis<ref>The largest bloc ([[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]) of first place votes is 42% for Memphis; no other rankings are considered. So even though 58%\u2014a true majority\u2014would be inconvenienced by having the capital at the most remote location, Memphis wins.</ref> and Knoxville<ref>Chattanooga (15%) is eliminated in the first round; votes transfer to Knoxville. Nashville (26%) eliminated in the second around; votes transfer to Knoxville. Knoxville wins with 58%.</ref> respectively. This would occur despite the fact that most people would have preferred Nashville to either of those \"winners\". Condorcet methods make these preferences obvious rather than ignoring or discarding them.\n\nOn the other hand, note that in this example Chattanooga also defeats Knoxville and Memphis when paired against those cities. If we changed the basis for defining preference and determined that Memphis voters preferred Chattanooga as a second choice rather than as a third choice, Chattanooga would be the Condorcet winner even though finishing in last place in a first-past-the-post election.\n\nAn alternative way of thinking about this example if a [[Smith set|Smith-efficient]] Condorcet method that passes [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives|ISDA]] is used to determine the winner is that 58% of the voters, a [[Mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]], ranked Memphis last and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville above Memphis, ruling Memphis out. At that point, the voters who preferred Memphis as their 1st choice could only help to choose a winner among Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, and because they all preferred Nashville as their 1st choice among those three, Nashville would've had a 68% majority of 1st choices among the remaining candidates and won because Condorcet passes the [[majority criterion]].\n\n==Circular ambiguities==\n\nAs noted above, sometimes an election has no Condorcet winner because there is no candidate who is preferred by voters to all other candidates. When this occurs the situation is known as a 'majority rule cycle', 'circular ambiguity', 'circular tie', 'Condorcet paradox', or simply a 'cycle'. This situation emerges when, once all votes have been tallied, the preferences of voters with respect to some candidates form a circle in which every candidate is beaten by at least one other candidate. For example, if there are three candidates, [[Rock-paper-scissors|Candidate Rock, Candidate Scissors, and Candidate Paper]], there will be no Condorcet winner if voters prefer Candidate Rock over Candidate Scissors and Scissors over Paper, but also Candidate Paper over Rock. Depending on the context in which elections are held, circular ambiguities may or may not be common, but there is no known case of a governmental election with ranked-choice voting in which a circular ambiguity is evident from the record of ranked ballots. Nonetheless an ambiguity is always possible, and so every Condorcet method should be capable of determining a winner when this contingency occurs. A mechanism for resolving an ambiguity is known as ambiguity resolution, cycle resolution method, or ''Condorcet completion method''.\n\nCircular ambiguities arise as a result of the [[voting paradox]]\u2014the result of an election can be intransitive (forming a cycle) even though all individual voters expressed a transitive preference. In a Condorcet election it is impossible for the preferences of a single voter to be cyclical, because a voter must rank all candidates in order, from top-choice to bottom-choice, and can only rank each candidate once, but the paradox of voting means that it is still possible for a circular ambiguity in voter tallies to emerge.\n\nThe idealized notion of a [[political spectrum]] is often used to describe political candidates and policies. Where this kind of spectrum exists, and voters prefer candidates who are closest to their own position on the spectrum, there is a Condorcet winner ([[Single peaked preferences|Black's Single-Peakedness Theorem]]).\n\nIn Condorcet methods, as in most electoral systems, there is also the possibility of an ordinary tie. This occurs when two or more candidates tie with each other but defeat every other candidate. As in other systems this can be resolved by a random method such as the drawing of lots. Ties can also be settled through other methods like seeing which of the tied winners had the most first choice votes, but this and some other non-random methods may re-introduce a degree of tactical voting, especially if voters know the race will be close.\n\nThe method used to resolve circular ambiguities is the main difference between the various Condorcet methods. Some cycle resolution methods are Smith-efficient, meaning that they pass the [[Smith criterion]]. This guarantees that when there is a cycle (and no pairwise ties), only the candidates in the cycle can win, and that if there is a [[mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]], one of their preferred candidates will win. There are countless ways in which this can be done, but every Condorcet method involves ignoring the majorities expressed by voters in at least some pairwise matchings.\n\nCondorcet methods fit within two categories:\n\n* '''Two-method systems''', which use a separate method to handle cases in which there is no Condorcet winner\n* '''One-method systems''', which use a single method that, without any special handling, always identifies the winner to be the Condorcet winner\n\nMany one-method systems and some two-method systems will give the same result as each other if there are fewer than 4 candidates in the circular tie, and all voters separately rank at least two of those candidates. These include Smith-Minimax (Minimax but done only after all candidates not in the Smith set are eliminated), Ranked Pairs, and Schulze.\n\n==Two-method systems==\n\nOne family of Condorcet methods consists of systems that first conduct a series of pairwise comparisons and then, if there is no Condorcet winner, fall back to an entirely different, non-Condorcet method to determine a winner. The simplest such fall-back methods involve entirely disregarding the results of the pairwise comparisons. For example, the Black method chooses the Condorcet winner if it exists, but uses the [[Borda count]] instead if there is an ambiguity (the method is named for [[Duncan Black]]).\n\nA more sophisticated two-stage process is, in the event of an ambiguity, to use a separate voting system to find the winner but to restrict this second stage to a certain subset of candidates found by scrutinizing the results of the pairwise comparisons. Sets used for this purpose are defined so that they will always contain only the Condorcet winner if there is one, and will always, in any case, contain at least one candidate. Such sets include the\n\n* '''[[Smith set]]''': The smallest non-empty set of candidates in a particular election such that every candidate in the set can beat all candidates outside the set. It is easily shown that there is only one possible Smith set for each election.\n* '''[[Schwartz set]]''': This is the innermost unbeaten set, and is usually the same as the Smith set. It is defined as the union of all possible sets of candidates such that for every set:\n*#Every candidate inside the set is pairwise unbeatable by any other candidate outside the set (i.e., ties are allowed).\n*#No proper (smaller) subset of the set fulfills the first property.\n* '''[[Landau set]]''' (or '''uncovered set''' or '''Fishburn set'''): the set of candidates, such that each member, for every other candidate (including those inside the set), either beats this candidate or beats a third candidate that itself beats the candidate that is unbeaten by the member.\n\nOne possible method is to apply [[instant-runoff voting]] to the candidates of the Smith set. This method has been described as 'Smith/IRV'. It's also possible to do \"Smith//Approval\" by allowing voters to rank candidates, and indicate which candidates they approve, such that the candidate in the Smith set approved by the most voters wins.\n\n==Single-method systems==\n\nSome Condorcet methods use a single procedure that inherently meets the Condorcet criteria and, without any extra procedure, also resolves circular ambiguities when they arise. In other words, these methods do not involve separate procedures for different situations. Typically these methods base their calculations on pairwise counts. These methods include:\n\n*'''[[Copeland's method]]''': This simple method involves electing the candidate who wins the most pairwise matchings. However, it often produces a tie.\n*'''[[Kemeny\u2013Young method]]''': This method ranks all the choices from most popular and second-most popular down to least popular.\n* '''[[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]]''': Also called ''Simpson'', ''Simpson\u2013Kramer'', and ''Simple Condorcet'', this method chooses the candidate whose worst pairwise defeat is better than that of all other candidates. A refinement of this method involves restricting it to choosing a winner from among the Smith set; this has been called ''Smith/Minimax''.\n* '''[[Nanson's method]]''' and '''[[Baldwin's method]]''' combine Borda Count with an instant runoff procedure.\n* '''[[Dodgson's method]]''' extends the Condorcet method by swapping candidates until a Condorcet winner is found. The winner is the candidate which requires the minimum number of swaps.\n* '''[[Ranked pairs]]''' breaks each cycle in the pairwise preference graph by dropping the weakest majority in the cycle, thereby yielding a complete ranking of the candidates. This method is also known as ''Tideman'', after its inventor [[Nicolaus Tideman]].\n*'''[[Schulze method]]''' iteratively drops the weakest majority in the pairwise preference graph until the winner becomes well defined. This method is also known as ''Schwartz sequential dropping'' (SSD), ''cloneproof Schwartz sequential dropping'' (CSSD), ''beatpath method'', ''beatpath winner'', ''path voting'' and ''path winner''.\n*'''[[Tideman alternative method]]''' restricts to the [[Smith set|Smith]] or [[Schwartz set|Schwartz]] set and, if more than one candidate remains, eliminates the candidate with the fewest votes and repeats the process. It is similar to Smith/IRV, except that it finds the Smith set before each round of IRV.\n*'''Smith//Score''' elects the candidate with the most points in the Smith Set. It requires either that voters vote on rated ballots (such as in [[Score voting]] or [[STAR voting]]), with the pairwise comparisons between candidates being done based on which candidate is '''scored''' higher than the other, or that they vote on ranked ballots that allow for indication of \"approval\" for each candidate i.e. a voter who ranks A>B>C and sets their approval threshold (the lowest rank at which they'd approve the candidates at that rank and any candidates ranked higher than that rank) at the 2nd rank would give A and B 1 point each (similar to [[Approval voting]]).\n\nRanked Pairs and Schulze are procedurally in some sense opposite approaches (although they very frequently give the same results):\n* Ranked Pairs (and its variants) starts with the strongest defeats and uses as much information as it can without creating ambiguity.\n* Schulze repeatedly removes the weakest defeat until ambiguity is removed.\n\nMinimax could be considered as more \"blunt\" than either of these approaches, as instead of removing defeats it can be seen as immediately removing candidates by looking at the strongest defeats (although their victories are still considered for subsequent candidate eliminations). One way to think of it in terms of removing defeats is that Minimax removes each candidate's weakest defeats until some group of candidates with only pairwise ties between them have no defeats left, at which point the group ties to win.<ref>https://www.rangevoting.org/SchulzeExplan.html Schulze's beatpath voting method \"MinMax method: Eliminate successively the weakest pairwise defeat until there is a candidate whose defeats have all been eliminated.\"</ref>\n\n===Kemeny\u2013Young method===\n{{Main|Kemeny\u2013Young method}}\nThe Kemeny\u2013Young method considers every possible sequence of choices in terms of which choice might be most popular, which choice might be second-most popular, and so on down to which choice might be least popular. Each such sequence is associated with a Kemeny score that is equal to the sum of the [[Condorcet method#Pairwise counting and matrices|pairwise counts]] that apply to the specified sequence. The sequence with the highest score is identified as the overall ranking, from most popular to least popular.\n\nWhen the pairwise counts are arranged in a matrix in which the choices appear in sequence from most popular (top and left) to least popular (bottom and right), the winning Kemeny score equals the sum of the counts in the upper-right, triangular half of the matrix (shown here in bold on a green background).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n! ...over '''Nashville'''\n! ...over '''Chattanooga'''\n! ...over '''Knoxville'''\n! ...over '''Memphis'''\n|-\n! Prefer '''Nashville'''...\n| \u2014\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''68'''\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''68'''\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''58'''\n|-\n!

Prefer '''Memphis'''...\n| 42\n| 42\n| 42\n| \u2014\n|}\n\nIn this example, the Kemeny Score of the sequence Nashville > Chattanooga > Knoxville > Memphis would be 393.\n\nCalculating every Kemeny score requires considerable computation time in cases that involve more than a few choices. However, fast calculation methods based on [[integer programming]] allow a computation time in seconds for some cases with as many as 40 choices.\n\n===Ranked pairs===\n{{Main|Ranked pairs}}\n\nThe order of finish is constructed a piece at a time by considering the (pairwise) majorities one at a time, from largest majority to smallest majority. For each majority, their higher-ranked candidate is placed ahead of their lower-ranked candidate in the (partially constructed) order of finish, except when their lower-ranked candidate has already been placed ahead of their higher-ranked candidate.\n\nFor example, suppose the voters' orders of preference are such that 75% rank B over C, 65% rank A over B, and 60% rank C over A. (The three majorities are a [[rock paper scissors]] cycle.) Ranked pairs begins with the largest majority, who rank B over C, and places B ahead of C in the order of finish. Then it considers the second largest majority, who rank A over B, and places A ahead of B in the order of finish. At this point, it has been established that A finishes ahead of B and B finishes ahead of C, which implies A also finishes ahead of C. So when ranked pairs considers the third largest majority, who rank C over A, their lower-ranked candidate A has already been placed ahead of their higher-ranked candidate C, so C is not placed ahead of A. The order of finish is \"A, B, C\" and A is the winner.\n\nAn equivalent definition is to find the order of finish that minimizes the size of the largest reversed majority. (In the 'lexicographical order' sense. If the largest majority reversed in two orders of finish is the same, the two orders of finish are compared by their second largest reversed majorities, etc. See [[Lexicographical order|the discussion of MinMax, MinLexMax and Ranked Pairs in the 'Motivation and uses' section of the Lexicographical Order article]]). (In the example, the order of finish \"A, B, C\" reverses the 60% who rank C over A. Any other order of finish would reverse a larger majority.) This definition is useful for simplifying some of the proofs of Ranked Pairs' properties, but the \"constructive\" definition executes much faster (small polynomial time).\n\n===Schulze method===\n{{Main|Schulze method}}\n\nThe [[Schulze method]] resolves votes as follows:\n\n:At each stage, we proceed as follows:\n\n:# For each pair of undropped candidates X and Y: If there is a directed path of undropped links from candidate X to candidate Y, then we write \"X \u2192 Y\"; otherwise we write \"not X \u2192 Y\".\n:# For each pair of undropped candidates V and W: If \"V \u2192 W\" and \"not W \u2192 V\", then candidate W is dropped and all links, that start or end in candidate W, are dropped.\n:# The weakest undropped link is dropped. If several undropped links tie as weakest, all of them are dropped.\n\n:The procedure ends when all links have been dropped. The winners are the undropped candidates.\n\nIn other words, this procedure repeatedly throws away the weakest pairwise defeat within the top set, until finally the number of votes left over produce an unambiguous decision.\n\n===Defeat strength===\nSome pairwise methods\u2014including minimax, Ranked Pairs, and the Schulze method\u2014resolve circular ambiguities based on the relative strength of the defeats. There are different ways to measure the strength of each defeat, and these include considering \"winning votes\" and \"margins\":\n\n*'''Winning votes''': The number of votes on the winning side of a defeat.\n*'''Margins''': The number of votes on the winning side of the defeat, minus the number of votes on the losing side of the defeat.\n\nIf voters do not rank their preferences for all of the candidates, these two approaches can yield different results. Consider, for example, the following election:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!45 voters\n!11 voters\n!15 voters\n!29 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|\n|\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|}\n\nThe pairwise defeats are as follows:\n\n*B beats A, 55 to 45 (55 winning votes, a margin of 10 votes)\n*A beats C, 45 to 44 (45 winning votes, a margin of 1 vote)\n*C beats B, 29 to 26 (29 winning votes, a margin of 3 votes)\n\nUsing the winning votes definition of defeat strength, the defeat of B by C is the weakest, and the defeat of A by B is the strongest. Using the margins definition of defeat strength, the defeat of C by A is the weakest, and the defeat of A by B is the strongest.\n\nUsing winning votes as the definition of defeat strength, candidate B would win under minimax, Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, but, using margins as the definition of defeat strength, candidate C would win in the same methods.\n\nIf all voters give complete rankings of the candidates, then winning votes and margins will always produce the same result. The difference between them can only come into play when some voters declare equal preferences amongst candidates, as occurs implicitly if they do not rank all candidates, as in the example above.\n\nThe choice between margins and winning votes is the subject of scholarly debate. Because all Condorcet methods always choose the Condorcet winner when one exists, the difference between methods only appears when cyclic ambiguity resolution is required. The argument for using winning votes follows from this: Because cycle resolution involves disenfranchising a selection of votes, then the selection should disenfranchise the fewest possible number of votes. When margins are used, the difference between the number of two candidates' votes may be small, but the number of votes may be very large\u2014or not. Only methods employing winning votes satisfy [[plurality criterion|Woodall's plurality criterion]].\n\nAn argument in favour of using margins is the fact that the result of a pairwise comparison is decided by the presence of more votes for one side than the other and thus that it follows naturally to assess the strength of a comparison by this \"surplus\" for the winning side. Otherwise, changing only a few votes from the winner to the loser could cause a sudden large change from a large score for one side to a large score for the other. In other words, one could consider losing votes being in fact disenfranchised when it comes to ambiguity resolution with winning votes. Also, using winning votes, a vote containing ties (possibly implicitly in the case of an incompletely ranked ballot) doesn't have the same effect as a number of equally weighted votes with total weight equaling one vote, such that the ties are broken in every possible way (a violation of [http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/ISSUE3/P5.HTM Woodall's symmetric-completion criterion]), as opposed to margins.\n\nUnder winning votes, if two more of the \"B\" voters decided to vote \"BC\", the A->C arm of the cycle would be overturned and Condorcet would pick C instead of B. This is an example of \"Unburying\" or \"Later does harm\". The margin method would pick C anyway.\n\nUnder the margin method, if three more \"BC\" voters decided to \"bury\" C by just voting \"B\", the A->C arm of the cycle would be strengthened and the resolution strategies would end up breaking the C->B arm and giving the win to B. This is an example of \"Burying\". The winning votes method would pick B anyway.\n\n==Related terms==\nOther terms related to the Condorcet method are:\n;Condorcet loser: the candidate who is less preferred than every other candidate in a pairwise matchup (preferred by fewer voters than any other candidate).\n;Weak Condorcet winner: a candidate who beats or ties with every other candidate in a pairwise matchup (preferred by at least as many voters as any other candidate). There can be more than one weak Condorcet winner.<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-014-0180-4 Weak Condorcet winner(s) revisited \"A weak Condorcet winner (WCW) is an alternative, y, that no majority of voters rank below any other alternative, z, but is not a SCW [Condorcet winner].\"</ref>\n;Weak Condorcet loser: a candidate who is defeated by or ties with every other candidate in a pairwise matchup. Similarly, there can be more than one weak Condorcet loser.\n\n==Condorcet ranking methods==\nSome Condorcet methods produce not just a single winner, but a ranking of all candidates from first to last place. A '''Condorcet ranking''' is a list of candidates with the property that the Condorcet winner (if one exists) comes first and the Condorcet loser (if one exists) comes last, and this holds recursively for the candidates ranked between them.\n\nMethods that satisfy this property include:\n* [[Copeland's method]]\n* [[Kemeny\u2013Young method]]\n* [[Ranked pairs]]\n* [[Schulze method]]\n\nThough there won't always be a Condorcet winner or Condorcet loser, there is always a Smith set and \"Smith loser set\" (smallest group of candidates who lose to all candidates not in the set in head-to-head elections). Some voting methods produce rankings that sort all candidates in the Smith set above all others, and all candidates in the Smith loser set below all others, with this holding recursively for all candidates ranked between them. Because the Smith set and Smith loser set are equivalent to the Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser when they exist, methods that always produce Smith set rankings also always produce Condorcet rankings.\n\n==Comparison with instant runoff and first-past-the-post (plurality)==\n\nMany proponents of [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV) are attracted by the belief that if their first choice does not win, their vote will be given to their second choice; if their second choice does not win, their vote will be given to their third choice, etc. This sounds perfect, but it is not true for every voter with IRV. If someone voted for a strong candidate, and their 2nd and 3rd choices are eliminated before their first choice is eliminated, IRV gives their vote to their 4th choice candidate, not their 2nd choice. [[Condorcet voting]] takes all rankings into account simultaneously, but at the expense of violating the [[later-no-harm criterion]] and the [[later-no-help criterion]]. With IRV, indicating a second choice will never affect your first choice. With Condorcet voting, it is possible that indicating a second choice will cause your first choice to lose.\n\n[[Plurality voting]] is simple, and theoretically provides incentives for voters to compromise for centrist candidates rather than throw away their votes on candidates who can't win. Opponents to plurality voting point out that voters often vote for the lesser of evils because they heard on the news that those two are the only two with a chance of winning, not necessarily because those two are the two natural compromises. This gives the media significant election powers. And if voters do compromise according to the media, the post election counts will prove the media right for next time. Condorcet runs each candidate against the other head to head, so that voters elect the candidate who would win the most sincere runoffs, instead of the one they thought they had to vote for.\n\nThere are circumstances, as in the examples above, when both [[instant-runoff voting]] and the '[[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]]' plurality system will fail to pick the Condorcet winner. (In fact, FPTP can elect the Condorcet loser and IRV can elect the second-worst candidate, who would lose to every candidate except the Condorcet loser.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Nanson|first=E. J.|date=1882|title=Methods of election|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsproc1719roya/page/207|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria|volume=19|pages=207\u2013208|quote=although Ware's method cannot return the worst, it may return the next worst.|via=}}</ref>) In cases where there is a Condorcet Winner, and where IRV does not choose it, a majority would by definition prefer the Condorcet Winner to the IRV winner. Proponents of the Condorcet criterion see it as a principal issue in selecting an electoral system. They see the Condorcet criterion as a natural extension of [[majority rule]]. Condorcet methods tend to encourage the selection of centrist candidates who appeal to the [[median]] voter. Here is an example that is designed to support IRV at the expense of Condorcet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!499 voters\n!3 voters\n!498 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|3. A\n|}\n\nB is preferred by a 501\u2013499 majority to A, and by a 502\u2013498 majority to C. So, according to the Condorcet criterion, B should win, despite the fact that very few voters rank B in first place. By contrast, IRV elects C and plurality elects A. The goal of a ranked voting system is for voters to be able to vote sincerely and trust the system to protect their intent. Plurality voting forces voters to do all their tactics before they vote, so that the system does not need to figure out their intent.\n\nThe significance of this scenario, of two parties with strong support, and the one with weak support being the Condorcet winner, may be misleading, though, as it is a common mode in plurality voting systems (see [[Duverger's law]]), but much less likely to occur in Condorcet or IRV elections, which unlike Plurality voting, punish candidates who alienate a significant block of voters.\n\nHere is an example that is designed to support Condorcet at the expense of IRV:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!33 voters\n!16 voters\n!16 voters\n!35 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. A\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|3. A\n|}\n\nB would win against either A or C by more than a 65\u201335 margin in a one-on-one election, but IRV eliminates B first, leaving a contest between the more \"polar\" candidates, A and C. Proponents of plurality voting state that their system is simpler than any other and more easily understood.\n\nAll three systems are susceptible to [[tactical voting]], but the types of tactics used and the frequency of strategic incentive differ in each method.\n\n==Potential for tactical voting==\n{{See also|Tactical voting#Condorcet}}\nLike all voting methods,<ref>Satterthwaite, Mark. \"Strategy-proofness and Arrow's conditions: Existence and correspondence theorems for voting procedures and social welfare functions\".</ref> Condorcet methods are vulnerable to [[Tactical voting|compromising]]. That is, voters can help avoid the election of a less-preferred candidate by insincerely raising the position of a more-preferred candidate on their ballot. However, Condorcet methods are only vulnerable to compromising when there is a [[Condorcet cycle|majority rule cycle]], or when one can be created.\n\nMany Condorcet methods are at least somewhat vulnerable to [[Tactical voting|burying]]. That is, voters can help a more-preferred candidate by insincerely lowering the position of a less-preferred candidate on their ballot.\n\nExample with the [[Schulze method]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!46 voters\n!44 voters\n!10 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. A\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|}\n* B is the sincere Condorcet winner. But since A has the most votes and almost has a majority, with A and B forming a [[mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]] of 90% of the voters, A can win by publicly instructing A voters to bury B with C (see * below), using B-top voters' 2nd choice support to win the election. If B, after hearing the public instructions, reciprocates by burying A with C, C will be elected, and this threat may be enough to keep A from pushing for his tactic. B's other possible recourse would be to attack A's ethics in proposing the tactic and call for all voters to vote sincerely. This is an example of the [[Chicken_(game)|chicken dilemma]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!46 voters\n!44 voters\n!10 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. C*\n|2. A\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. B*\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|}\n* B beats A by 8 as before, and A beats C by 82 as before, but ''now'' C beats B by 12, forming a [[Smith set]] greater than one. Even the [[Schulze method]] elects A: The path strength of A beats B is the lesser of 82 and 12, so 12. The path strength of B beats A is only 8, which is less than 12, so A wins. B voters are powerless to do anything about the public announcement by A, and C voters just hope B reciprocates, or maybe consider compromise voting for B if they dislike A enough.\n\nSupporters of Condorcet methods which exhibit this potential problem could rebut this concern by pointing out that pre-election polls are most necessary with [[plurality voting]], and that voters, armed with ranked choice voting, could lie to pre-election pollsters, making it impossible for Candidate A to know whether or how to bury. It is also nearly impossible to predict ahead of time how many supporters of A would actually follow the instructions, and how many would be alienated by such an obvious attempt to manipulate the system.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!33 voters\n!16 voters\n!16 voters\n!35 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. A\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|3. A\n|}\n* In the above example, if C voters bury B with A, A will be elected instead of B. Since C voters prefer B to A, only they would be hurt by attempting the burying. Except for the first example where one candidate has the most votes and has a near majority, the Schulze method is very resistant to burying.\n\n==Evaluation by criteria==\n\nScholars of electoral systems often compare them using mathematically defined [[Comparison of electoral systems|voting system criteria]]. The criteria which Condorcet methods satisfy vary from one Condorcet method to another. However, the Condorcet criterion implies the [[majority criterion]]; the Condorcet criterion is incompatible with [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (though it implies a weaker form of the criterion: when there is a Condorcet winner, losing candidates can drop out of the election without changing the result)<ref> https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02973 The Schulze Method of Voting p.351 \"The Condorcet criterion for single-winner elections (section 4.7) is important because, when there is a Condorcet winner b \u2208 A, then it is still a Condorcet winner when alternatives a1,...,an \u2208 A \\ {b} are removed. So an alternative b \u2208 A doesn\u2019t owe his property of being a Condorcet winner to the presence of some other alternatives. Therefore, when we declare a Condorcet winner b \u2208 A elected whenever a Condorcet winner exists, we know that no other alternatives a1,...,an \u2208 A \\ {b} have changed the result of the election without being elected.\"</ref>, [[later-no-harm]], the [[participation criterion]], and the [[consistency criterion]]. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"font-size:90%;line-height:1;\"\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Condorcet<br />method|Voting system<br />criterion}} !!

Organizations which currently use some variant of the Condorcet method are:\n\n* The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] used the [[Schulze method]] to elect its Board of Trustees until 2013, when it switched to a [[ratings ballot]] with Support/Neutral/Oppose ballots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections_2013/Results|title=Wikimedia Foundation elections 2013/Results \u2013 Meta|website=meta.wikimedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>\n* The [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party of Sweden]] uses the [[Schulze method]] for its primaries\n* The [[Debian]] project uses the [[Schulze method]] for internal referenda and to elect its leader\n* The [[Software in the Public Interest]] corporation uses the [[Schulze method]] for internal referenda and to elect its Board of Directors\n* The [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo Foundation]] uses the [[Schulze method]] for internal referenda and to elect its Board of Trustees and its Council\n* The [[Free State Project]] used [[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]] for choosing its target state\n* The [[United Kingdom|uk]].* hierarchy of [[Usenet]]\n* The [[Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia|Student Society of the University of British Columbia]] uses [[ranked pairs]] for its executive elections.\n* [[Kingman Hall]] and [[Hillegass Parker House]], two loosely affiliated [[student housing cooperative]]s, each use the [[Schulze method]] to elect their management teams.\n{{See also|Schulze method#Users|l1=Use of the Schulze method}}\n\n==Other considerations==\n\n* Condorcet election results show the win margins for every head to head runoff. If the Condorcet winner (A) is part of an A beats B beats C beats A [[Smith set]], supporters of Candidate C will know that Candidate C would win a [[recall election]] if candidate B is somehow kept off the ballot. If Condorcet voting is used, the rules for ballot access in recall elections may need to be evaluated to take the potential motives into consideration.\n\n* If every seat in a legislature is elected (in separate elections, by the same pool of voters \u2013 use of districts will avoid this) by the Condorcet method, the legislators would all be centrists and might all agree with each on what laws to pass. Some voters prefer to have opposites in the legislature so they can't pass laws easily. These voters might prefer the Condorcet method for electing executive offices.\n\n* If 10 candidates run for governor in a Condorcet race, ballot counters may need to count 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45 head to head runoffs to find the winner. While this is doable, it might be more practical to still use ballot access laws or primaries, defeating some of the original intent of the Condorcet method. Computers can be used to speed up the counts, though some voters fear computers can be hacked and used for ballot counting fraud. Another option would be to allow several independent scanner owners count the ballots and compare results. Volunteer hand counters could then spot check various candidates and ranks to make sure they match the subtotals reported by the scanners. It is also possible to limit the number of ranks voters can use; for example, if every voter is only allowed to rank each candidate either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, with equal rankings allowed, then only the runoffs between candidates ranked 1st and 2nd, 1st and 3rd, 1st and last, 2nd and 3rd, 2nd and last, and 3rd and last need be counted, as the runoffs between two candidates at the same rank will result in ties.\n\n* If there are no more than 5 candidates ( or a larger number of candidates is short-listed to 5) then the amount of effort counting ballots could be reduced to normal acceptable levels by asking voters to select an order of preference from a predetermined list of the possibilities. This would mean that the ballots would just require to be counted once to determine the number of votes cast for each order of preference. The results would then be entered into a simple spreadsheet which would determine the Condorcet winner.\n\n* Voters make an economic trade-off in the amount of time invested in researching and ranking candidates.  If voters rank too few candidates or [[donkey voting|rank such as to inaccurately represent their preferences]], the Condorcet candidate cannot be correctly discovered. Nominating primaries reduce the number of candidates to avoid this, and the style of nominating primary can impact whether the Condorcet candidate\u2014or at least a similar candidate\u2014remains or if all such candidates are eliminated in favor of polarized options.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n* [[Condorcet loser criterion]]\n* [[Ramon Llull]] (1232\u20131315) who, with the 2001 discovery of his lost manuscripts ''Ars notandi'', ''Ars eleccionis'', and ''Alia ars eleccionis'', was given credit for discovering the Borda count and Condorcet criterion (Llull winner) in the 13th century\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last =  Black | first =  Duncan | title = The Theory of Committees and Elections | url =  https://archive.org/details/theoryofcommitte0000blac | url-access =  registration | publisher =  Cambridge University Press | year = 1958}}\n* {{cite book | last = Farquarson | first = Robin | title = Theory of Voting | location = Oxford | year = 1969}}\n* {{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya Kumar| title = Collective Choice and Social Welfare | isbn = 978-0-8162-7765-0 | year = 1970 | publisher = Holden-Day}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- this section contains a lot of links; please try to keep it organized by the author's last name. -->\n* {{Citation | url = http://pj.freefaculty.org/Ukraine/PJ3_VotingSystemsEssay.pdf | title = Voting Systems | first = Paul E | last = Johnson | publisher = Free faculty | accessdate = 2015-06-27}}.\n* {{Citation | url = http://robla.net/1996/politics/condorcet.html | title = Condorcet's Method | first = Robert \u2018Rob\u2019 | last = Lanphier}}.<!-- Broken.

A candidate with this property, the ''pairwise champion'' or ''beats-all winner'', is formally called the ''Condorcet winner''.<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003550000071 Condorcet efficiency: A preference for indifference \"The Condorcet winner in an election is the candidate who would be able to defeat all other candidates in a series of pairwise elections.\"</ref>\n\nA Condorcet winner might not always exist in a particular election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can possibly be cyclic \u2014 that is, it is possible (but very rare) that each candidate has an opponent that defeats them in a two-candidate contest. <ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30022874?seq=1 Condorcet's Paradox and Anonymous Preference Profiles \"Condorcet's paradox [6] of simple majority voting occurs in a voting situation [...] if for every alternative there is a second alternative which more voters prefer to the first alternative than conversely.\" </ref>(This is similar to the game [[rock paper scissors]], where each hand shape wins against only one opponent and loses to another). The possibility of such cyclic preferences in a group of voters is known as the [[Condorcet paradox]]. However, there always exists a smallest group of candidates preferred by more voters than any others, known as the [[Smith set]], which is guaranteed to only have the Condorcet winner in it when one exists; some voting methods which guarantee the election of the Condorcet winner don't always elect a candidate from the Smith set. Voting methods that do so are said to be \"Smith-efficient\". <ref> http://pj.freefaculty.org/Papers/Ukraine/PJ3_VotingSystemsEssay.pdf Voting Systems \"Formally, the Smith set is defined as the smaller of two sets:\n1. The set of all alternatives, X.\n2. A subset A \u2282 X such that each member of A can defeat every member of X that is\n36\nnot in A, which we call B=X \u2212 A.\"</ref>Smith-efficient Condorcet methods only differ when picking a winner when there is no Condorcet winner on which member of the Smith set they pick, with most agreeing when there are 3 or fewer candidates in the Smith set. For example, Schulze and Ranked pairs always give the same results when the Smith set has 3 candidates with no pairwise ties between them (because these methods pass [[ISDA]], so all candidates not in the Smith set can be eliminated, and then for Schulze, dropping the weakest defeat yields only one pairwise victory, while with Ranked Pairs, once the first two strongest defeats are locked in, the weakest can't, since it'd create a cycle). The Condorcet winner is also usually but not necessarily the [[Utility|utilitarian]] winner (the one which maximizes [[Social welfare function|social welfare]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pivato|first=Marcus|date=2015-08-01|title=Condorcet meets Bentham|url= |journal=Journal of Mathematical Economics|volume=59|pages=58\u201365|doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2015.04.006|quote=Indeed, it is easy to construct examples where the Condorcet winner does not maximize social welfare [...however...] in a large population satisfying certain statistical regularities, not only is the Condorcet winner almost guaranteed to exist, but it is almost guaranteed to also be the utilitarian social choice.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lehtinen|first=Aki|date=2007-08-01|title=The Welfare Consequences of Strategic Voting in Two Commonly Used Parliamentary Agendas|journal=Theory and Decision|language=en|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1\u201340|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9028-4|issn=0040-5833|quote=If the CW is not the same alternative as the utilitarian winner (UW), the latter ought to be selected according to the utilitarian welfare criterion|citeseerx=10.1.1.727.3928}}</ref> \n\nCondorcet voting methods are named for the 18th-century French [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]] Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], who championed such voting systems.  However, [[Ramon Llull]] devised the earliest known Condorcet method in 1299.<ref>{{cite journal|author=G. H\u00e4gele and F.

A voter's ranking is often called their ''order of preference,'' although it may not match their sincere order of preference since voters are free to rank in any order they choose and may have strategic reasons to misrepresent preferences. The votes can be tallied in many ways to find a winner. Some - the Condorcet methods - will elect the Condorcet winner if there is one. They can also elect a winner when there is no Condorcet winner, and different Condorcet-compliant methods may elect different winners in the case of a cycle - Condorcet methods differ on which other criteria they satisfy.\n\nThe procedure given in [[Robert's Rules of Order]] for voting on motions and amendments is also a Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by expressing their orders of preference.<ref> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01789561 Did Jefferson or Madison understand Condorcet's theory of social choice? \"Binary procedures of the Jefferson/Robert variety will select the Condorcet winner if one exists\"</ref> There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is between two of the alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing survives to be paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is analogous to a single-winner tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert's Rules. But this method cannot reveal a [[voting paradox]] in which there is no Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an early loser over the eventual winner. A considerable portion of the literature on social choice theory is about the properties of this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments to administer; however, these shortcomings could be overcome by asking voters to select preference order from a predetermined list of preference orders. For example where there are candidates A, B and C, there are six orders of preference, so voters could be asked to choose which of the six they wish to vote for. Counting would then be simply a matter of counting how votes were cast for each order of preference. The results could then be applied to a simple spreadsheet which revealed the Condorcet winner. If there were four candidates (options) then there would be 24 orders of preference; if there were five candidates then there would be 120 orders of preference and so on.\n\n==Summary==\nIn a contest between candidates A and B run using the preferential-vote form of Condorcet method, if more voters mark their ballots that they prefer candidate A over candidate B than the number of voters who mark their ballots to the contrary, then Candidate B is not (supposed to be) elected.\n\nHowever, because of the possibility of the [[Condorcet paradox]], it is possible, but unlikely,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Voting paradoxes and group coherence : the condorcet efficiency of voting rules|last=Gehrlein, William V.|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=Lepelley, Dominique.|isbn=9783642031076|location=Berlin|pages=|oclc=695387286|quote=empirical studies ... indicate that some of the most common paradoxes are relatively unlikely to be observed in actual elections. ... it is easily concluded that Condorcet\u2019s Paradox should very rarely be observed in any real elections on a small number of candidates with large electorates, as long as voters\u2019 preferences reflect any reasonable degree of group mutual coherence}}</ref> that this objective cannot be realized in a specific election. This is sometimes called a ''Condorcet cycle'' or just ''cycle'' and can be thought of as [[rock paper scissors|Candidate Rock beating Candidate Scissors, Candidate Scissors beating Candidate Paper, and Candidate Paper beating Candidate Rock]]. It is only in how the various Condorcet methods resolve such a cycle that they effectively differ (though most elections do not have cycles; see [[Condorcet paradox#Likelihood of the paradox]] for estimates). If there is no cycle, all Condorcet methods elect the same candidate and are operationally equivalent.\n\n*Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference (top-to-bottom, or best-to-worst, or 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The voter may be allowed to rank candidates as equals, to express indifference between them. To save time, candidates omitted by a voter may be treated as if the voter ranked them at the bottom.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n*For each pairing of candidates (as in a [[round-robin tournament]]) count how many votes rank each candidate over the other candidate. Thus each pairing will have two totals: the size of its majority and the size of its minority.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nFor most Condorcet methods, those counts usually suffice to determine the complete order of finish. They always suffice to determine whether there is a Condorcet winner. Additional information may be needed in the event of ties. Ties can be pairings that have no majority, or they can be majorities that are the same size; these ties will be rare when there are many voters. Some Condorcet methods may have other kinds of ties; for example, it would not be rare for two or more candidates to win the same number of pairings, when there is no Condorcet winner.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Definition==\nA Condorcet method is a voting system that will always elect the Condorcet winner (if there is one); this is the candidate whom voters prefer to each other candidate, when compared to them one at a time. This candidate can be found (if they exist; see next paragraph) by conducting a series of pairwise comparisons, using the procedure given in Robert's Rules of Order, described above. For ''N'' candidates, this requires ''N'' - 1 pairwise hypothetical elections. For example, with 5 candidates there are 4 pairwise comparisons to be made, since after each comparison, a candidate is eliminated, and after 4 eliminations, only one of the original 5 candidates will remain. \n\nTo confirm that a Condorcet winner exists in a given election, first do the above procedure, declare the final remaining candidate the procedure's winner, \"un-eliminate\" all eliminated candidates, and then do at most an additional ''N'' - 2 pairwise comparisons between the procedure's winner and any candidates they haven't been compared against yet. If the procedure's winner doesn't win all pairwise matchups, then no Condorcet winner exists in the election. \n\nNote that computing the entire pairwise matrix requires \u00bd''N''(''N''\u22121) pairwise comparisons for ''N'' candidates. \n\nThe family of Condorcet methods is also referred to collectively as Condorcet's method. A voting system that always elects the Condorcet winner when there is one is described by electoral scientists as a system that satisfies the Condorcet criterion.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn certain circumstances, an election has no Condorcet winner. This occurs as a result of a kind of tie known as a ''majority rule cycle'', described by [[Voting paradox|Condorcet's paradox]]. The manner in which a winner is then chosen varies from one Condorcet method to another. Some Condorcet methods involve the basic procedure described below, coupled with a Condorcet completion method, which is used to find a winner when there is no Condorcet winner. Other Condorcet methods involve an entirely different system of counting, but are classified as Condorcet methods because they will still elect the Condorcet winner if there is one.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIt is important to note that not all single winner, [[ranked voting systems]] are Condorcet methods. For example, [[instant-runoff voting]] and the [[Borda count]] are not Condorcet methods.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Basic procedure==\n\n===Voting===\n\nIn a Condorcet election the voter ranks the list of candidates in order of preference. So, for example, the voter gives a \"1\" to their first preference, a \"2\" to their second preference, and so on. In this respect it is the same as an election held under non-Condorcet methods such as [[instant-runoff voting]] or the [[single transferable vote]]. Some Condorcet methods allow voters to rank more than one candidate equally, so that, for example, the voter might express two first preferences rather than just one.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} It is possible to instead allow voters to rate the candidates on a scale, similar to [[Score voting]].\n\nUsually, when a voter does not give a full list of preferences they are assumed, for the purpose of the count, to prefer the candidates they have ranked over all other candidates. Some Condorcet elections permit [[write-in candidate]]s but, because this can be difficult to implement, software designed for conducting Condorcet elections often does not allow this option.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Finding the winner===\n\nThe count is conducted by pitting every candidate against every other candidate in a series of hypothetical one-on-one contests. The winner of each pairing is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. Unless they tie, there is always a majority when there are only two choices. The candidate preferred by each voter is taken to be the one in the pair that the voter ranks (or rates) higher on their ballot paper. For example, if Alice is paired against Bob it is necessary to count both the number of voters who have ranked Alice higher than Bob, and the number who have ranked Bob higher than Alice. If Alice is preferred by more voters then she is the winner of that pairing. When all possible pairings of candidates have been considered, if one candidate beats every other candidate in these contests then they are declared the Condorcet winner. As noted above, if there is no Condorcet winner a further method must be used to find the winner of the election, and this mechanism varies from one Condorcet method to another.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In any Condorcet method that passes [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives]], it can help to identify the [[Smith set]] from the head-to-head matchups (by looking for a smallest group of candidates who beat all candidates not in the group), and eliminate all candidates not in the set before doing the procedure.\n\n===Pairwise counting and matrices===\n\nCondorcet methods use pairwise counting. For each possible pair of candidates, one pairwise count indicates how many voters prefer one of the paired candidates over the other candidate, and another pairwise count indicates how many voters have the opposite preference. The counts for all possible pairs of candidates summarize all the preferences of all the voters.\n\nPairwise counts are often displayed in a ''pairwise comparison matrix''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2U8jd2AJkEC&lpg=PA6&pg=PA6|title=Democracy defended|last=Mackie, Gerry.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0511062648|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=6|oclc=252507400}}</ref> or ''outranking matrix''<ref>{{Citation|last=Nurmi|first=Hannu|chapter=On the Relevance of Theoretical Results to Voting System Choice|date=2012|pages=255\u2013274|editor-last=Felsenthal|editor-first=Dan S.|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-20441-8_10|isbn=9783642204401|editor2-last=Machover|editor2-first=Mosh\u00e9|title=Electoral Systems|series=Studies in Choice and Welfare|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f8cb5311f6e040e674c6fd80f17382a0e4bc5ed8}}</ref> such as those below.

The first matrix below records the preferences expressed on a single ballot paper, in which the voter's preferences are (B, C, A, D); that is, the voter ranked B first, C second, A third, and D fourth. In the matrix a '1' indicates that the runner is preferred over the 'opponent', while a '0' indicates that the runner is defeated.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:13em;margin:auto;text-align:center\"\n! {{diagonal split header|Runner|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opponent}} !!

Each ballot can be transformed into this style of matrix, and then added to all other ballot matrices using [[matrix addition]]. The sum of all ballots in an election is called the sum matrix.\n\nSuppose that in the imaginary election there are two other voters. Their preferences are (D, A, C, B) and (A, C, B, D). Added to the first voter, these ballots would give the following sum matrix:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:13em;margin:auto;text-align:center\"\n! {{diagonal split header|Runner|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opponent}} !! A !! B !! C !! D\n|-\n! A\n|| \u2014\n|| 2 || 2 || 2\n|-\n! B\n|| 1 || \u2014 || 1 || 2\n|-\n! C\n|| 1 || 2 || \u2014 || 2\n|-\n! D\n|| 1 || 1 || 1 || \u2014\n|}\n\nWhen the sum matrix is found, the contest between each pair of candidates is considered. The number of votes for runner over opponent (runner,opponent) is compared with the number of votes for opponent over runner (opponent,runner) to find the Condorcet winner. In the sum matrix above, A is the Condorcet winner because A beats every other candidate. When there is no Condorcet winner Condorcet completion methods, such as Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, use the information contained in the sum matrix to choose a winner.\n\nCells marked '\u2014' in the matrices above have a numerical value of '0', but a dash is used since candidates are never preferred to themselves. The first matrix, that represents a single ballot, is inversely symmetric: (runner,opponent) is \u00ac(opponent,runner). Or (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = 1. The sum matrix has this property: (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = N for N voters, if all runners were fully ranked by each voter.\n\n==Example: Voting on the location of Tennessee's capital==\n{{Tenn voting example}}\n\nTo find the Condorcet winner every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of imaginary one-on-one contests. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. When results for every possible pairing have been found they are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pair !! Winner\n|-\n| Memphis (42%) vs. Nashville (58%)|| Nashville\n|-\n| Memphis (42%) vs. Chattanooga (58%)|| Chattanooga\n|-\n| Memphis (42%) vs. Knoxville (58%)|| Knoxville\n|-\n| Nashville (68%) vs. Chattanooga (32%)|| Nashville\n|-\n| Nashville (68%) vs. Knoxville (32%)||Nashville\n|-\n| Chattanooga (83%) vs. Knoxville (17%)|| Chattanooga\n|}\n\nThe results can also be shown in the form of a matrix:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #ccffcc\" | Nashville [N]\n|3 Wins \u2193\n|-\n!2nd\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #ddddff\" | Chattanooga [C]\n|1 Loss \u2192\n\u2193 2 Wins\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [N] 68%<br>[C] 32%\n|-\n!3rd\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffeedd\" | Knoxville [K]\n|2 Losses \u2192\n\u2193 1 Win\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [C] 83% <br>[K] 17%\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [N] 68% <br>[K] 32%\n|-\n!4th\n! style=\"background: #ffdddd\" | Memphis [M]\n|3 Losses \u2192\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [K] 58% <br>[M] 42%\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [C] 58% <br>[M] 42%\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | [N] 58% <br>[M] 42%\n|}\n\n* \n*\n*\n\nAs can be seen from both of the tables above, Nashville beats every other candidate. This means that Nashville is the Condorcet winner. Nashville will thus win an election held under any possible Condorcet method.\n\nWhile any Condorcet method will elect Nashville as the winner, if instead an election based on the same votes were held using [[first-past-the-post]] or [[instant-runoff voting]], these systems would select Memphis<ref>The largest bloc ([[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]) of first place votes is 42% for Memphis; no other rankings are considered. So even though 58%\u2014a true majority\u2014would be inconvenienced by having the capital at the most remote location, Memphis wins.</ref> and Knoxville<ref>Chattanooga (15%) is eliminated in the first round; votes transfer to Knoxville. Nashville (26%) eliminated in the second around; votes transfer to Knoxville. Knoxville wins with 58%.</ref> respectively. This would occur despite the fact that most people would have preferred Nashville to either of those \"winners\". Condorcet methods make these preferences obvious rather than ignoring or discarding them.\n\nOn the other hand, note that in this example Chattanooga also defeats Knoxville and Memphis when paired against those cities. If we changed the basis for defining preference and determined that Memphis voters preferred Chattanooga as a second choice rather than as a third choice, Chattanooga would be the Condorcet winner even though finishing in last place in a first-past-the-post election.\n\nAn alternative way of thinking about this example if a [[Smith set|Smith-efficient]] Condorcet method that passes [[Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives|ISDA]] is used to determine the winner is that 58% of the voters, a [[Mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]], ranked Memphis last and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville above Memphis, ruling Memphis out. At that point, the voters who preferred Memphis as their 1st choice could only help to choose a winner among Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, and because they all preferred Nashville as their 1st choice among those three, Nashville would've had a 68% majority of 1st choices among the remaining candidates and won because Condorcet passes the [[majority criterion]].\n\n==Circular ambiguities==\n\nAs noted above, sometimes an election has no Condorcet winner because there is no candidate who is preferred by voters to all other candidates. When this occurs the situation is known as a 'majority rule cycle', 'circular ambiguity', 'circular tie', 'Condorcet paradox', or simply a 'cycle'. This situation emerges when, once all votes have been tallied, the preferences of voters with respect to some candidates form a circle in which every candidate is beaten by at least one other candidate. For example, if there are three candidates, [[Rock-paper-scissors|Candidate Rock, Candidate Scissors, and Candidate Paper]], there will be no Condorcet winner if voters prefer Candidate Rock over Candidate Scissors and Scissors over Paper, but also Candidate Paper over Rock. Depending on the context in which elections are held, circular ambiguities may or may not be common, but there is no known case of a governmental election with ranked-choice voting in which a circular ambiguity is evident from the record of ranked ballots. Nonetheless an ambiguity is always possible, and so every Condorcet method should be capable of determining a winner when this contingency occurs. A mechanism for resolving an ambiguity is known as ambiguity resolution, cycle resolution method, or ''Condorcet completion method''.\n\nCircular ambiguities arise as a result of the [[voting paradox]]\u2014the result of an election can be intransitive (forming a cycle) even though all individual voters expressed a transitive preference. In a Condorcet election it is impossible for the preferences of a single voter to be cyclical, because a voter must rank all candidates in order, from top-choice to bottom-choice, and can only rank each candidate once, but the paradox of voting means that it is still possible for a circular ambiguity in voter tallies to emerge.\n\nThe idealized notion of a [[political spectrum]] is often used to describe political candidates and policies. Where this kind of spectrum exists, and voters prefer candidates who are closest to their own position on the spectrum, there is a Condorcet winner ([[Single peaked preferences|Black's Single-Peakedness Theorem]]).\n\nIn Condorcet methods, as in most electoral systems, there is also the possibility of an ordinary tie. This occurs when two or more candidates tie with each other but defeat every other candidate. As in other systems this can be resolved by a random method such as the drawing of lots. Ties can also be settled through other methods like seeing which of the tied winners had the most first choice votes, but this and some other non-random methods may re-introduce a degree of tactical voting, especially if voters know the race will be close.\n\nThe method used to resolve circular ambiguities is the main difference between the various Condorcet methods. Some cycle resolution methods are Smith-efficient, meaning that they pass the [[Smith criterion]]. This guarantees that when there is a cycle (and no pairwise ties), only the candidates in the cycle can win, and that if there is a [[mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]], one of their preferred candidates will win. There are countless ways in which this can be done, but every Condorcet method involves ignoring the majorities expressed by voters in at least some pairwise matchings.\n\nCondorcet methods fit within two categories:\n\n* '''Two-method systems''', which use a separate method to handle cases in which there is no Condorcet winner\n* '''One-method systems''', which use a single method that, without any special handling, always identifies the winner to be the Condorcet winner\n\nMany one-method systems and some two-method systems will give the same result as each other if there are fewer than 4 candidates in the circular tie, and all voters separately rank at least two of those candidates. These include Smith-Minimax (Minimax but done only after all candidates not in the Smith set are eliminated), Ranked Pairs, and Schulze.\n\n==Two-method systems==\n\nOne family of Condorcet methods consists of systems that first conduct a series of pairwise comparisons and then, if there is no Condorcet winner, fall back to an entirely different, non-Condorcet method to determine a winner. The simplest such fall-back methods involve entirely disregarding the results of the pairwise comparisons. For example, the Black method chooses the Condorcet winner if it exists, but uses the [[Borda count]] instead if there is an ambiguity (the method is named for [[Duncan Black]]).\n\nA more sophisticated two-stage process is, in the event of an ambiguity, to use a separate voting system to find the winner but to restrict this second stage to a certain subset of candidates found by scrutinizing the results of the pairwise comparisons. Sets used for this purpose are defined so that they will always contain only the Condorcet winner if there is one, and will always, in any case, contain at least one candidate. Such sets include the\n\n* '''[[Smith set]]''': The smallest non-empty set of candidates in a particular election such that every candidate in the set can beat all candidates outside the set. It is easily shown that there is only one possible Smith set for each election.\n* '''[[Schwartz set]]''': This is the innermost unbeaten set, and is usually the same as the Smith set. It is defined as the union of all possible sets of candidates such that for every set:\n*#Every candidate inside the set is pairwise unbeatable by any other candidate outside the set (i.e., ties are allowed).\n*#No proper (smaller) subset of the set fulfills the first property.\n* '''[[Landau set]]''' (or '''uncovered set''' or '''Fishburn set'''): the set of candidates, such that each member, for every other candidate (including those inside the set), either beats this candidate or beats a third candidate that itself beats the candidate that is unbeaten by the member.\n\nOne possible method is to apply [[instant-runoff voting]] to the candidates of the Smith set. This method has been described as 'Smith/IRV'. It's also possible to do \"Smith//Approval\" by allowing voters to rank candidates, and indicate which candidates they approve, such that the candidate in the Smith set approved by the most voters wins.\n\n==Single-method systems==\n\nSome Condorcet methods use a single procedure that inherently meets the Condorcet criteria and, without any extra procedure, also resolves circular ambiguities when they arise. In other words, these methods do not involve separate procedures for different situations. Typically these methods base their calculations on pairwise counts. These methods include:\n\n*'''[[Copeland's method]]''': This simple method involves electing the candidate who wins the most pairwise matchings. However, it often produces a tie.\n*'''[[Kemeny\u2013Young method]]''': This method ranks all the choices from most popular and second-most popular down to least popular.\n* '''[[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]]''': Also called ''Simpson'', ''Simpson\u2013Kramer'', and ''Simple Condorcet'', this method chooses the candidate whose worst pairwise defeat is better than that of all other candidates. A refinement of this method involves restricting it to choosing a winner from among the Smith set; this has been called ''Smith/Minimax''.\n* '''[[Nanson's method]]''' and '''[[Baldwin's method]]''' combine Borda Count with an instant runoff procedure.\n* '''[[Dodgson's method]]''' extends the Condorcet method by swapping candidates until a Condorcet winner is found. The winner is the candidate which requires the minimum number of swaps.\n* '''[[Ranked pairs]]''' breaks each cycle in the pairwise preference graph by dropping the weakest majority in the cycle, thereby yielding a complete ranking of the candidates. This method is also known as ''Tideman'', after its inventor [[Nicolaus Tideman]].\n*'''[[Schulze method]]''' iteratively drops the weakest majority in the pairwise preference graph until the winner becomes well defined. This method is also known as ''Schwartz sequential dropping'' (SSD), ''cloneproof Schwartz sequential dropping'' (CSSD), ''beatpath method'', ''beatpath winner'', ''path voting'' and ''path winner''.\n*'''[[Tideman alternative method]]''' restricts to the [[Smith set|Smith]] or [[Schwartz set|Schwartz]] set and, if more than one candidate remains, eliminates the candidate with the fewest votes and repeats the process. It is similar to Smith/IRV, except that it finds the Smith set before each round of IRV.\n*'''Smith//Score''' elects the candidate with the most points in the Smith Set. It requires either that voters vote on rated ballots (such as in [[Score voting]] or [[STAR voting]]), with the pairwise comparisons between candidates being done based on which candidate is '''scored''' higher than the other, or that they vote on ranked ballots that allow for indication of \"approval\" for each candidate i.e. a voter who ranks A>B>C and sets their approval threshold (the lowest rank at which they'd approve the candidates at that rank and any candidates ranked higher than that rank) at the 2nd rank would give A and B 1 point each (similar to [[Approval voting]]).\n\nRanked Pairs and Schulze are procedurally in some sense opposite approaches (although they very frequently give the same results):\n* Ranked Pairs (and its variants) starts with the strongest defeats and uses as much information as it can without creating ambiguity.\n* Schulze repeatedly removes the weakest defeat until ambiguity is removed.\n\nMinimax could be considered as more \"blunt\" than either of these approaches, as instead of removing defeats it can be seen as immediately removing candidates by looking at the strongest defeats (although their victories are still considered for subsequent candidate eliminations). One way to think of it in terms of removing defeats is that Minimax removes each candidate's weakest defeats until some group of candidates with only pairwise ties between them have no defeats left, at which point the group ties to win.<ref>https://www.rangevoting.org/SchulzeExplan.html Schulze's beatpath voting method \"MinMax method: Eliminate successively the weakest pairwise defeat until there is a candidate whose defeats have all been eliminated.\"</ref>\n\n===Kemeny\u2013Young method===\n{{Main|Kemeny\u2013Young method}}\nThe Kemeny\u2013Young method considers every possible sequence of choices in terms of which choice might be most popular, which choice might be second-most popular, and so on down to which choice might be least popular. Each such sequence is associated with a Kemeny score that is equal to the sum of the [[Condorcet method#Pairwise counting and matrices|pairwise counts]] that apply to the specified sequence. The sequence with the highest score is identified as the overall ranking, from most popular to least popular.\n\nWhen the pairwise counts are arranged in a matrix in which the choices appear in sequence from most popular (top and left) to least popular (bottom and right), the winning Kemeny score equals the sum of the counts in the upper-right, triangular half of the matrix (shown here in bold on a green background).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n! ...over '''Nashville'''\n! ...over '''Chattanooga'''\n! ...over '''Knoxville'''\n! ...over '''Memphis'''\n|-\n! Prefer '''Nashville'''...\n| \u2014\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''68'''\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''68'''\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''58'''\n|-\n!

Prefer '''Memphis'''...\n| 42\n| 42\n| 42\n| \u2014\n|}\n\nIn this example, the Kemeny Score of the sequence Nashville > Chattanooga > Knoxville > Memphis would be 393.\n\nCalculating every Kemeny score requires considerable computation time in cases that involve more than a few choices. However, fast calculation methods based on [[integer programming]] allow a computation time in seconds for some cases with as many as 40 choices.\n\n===Ranked pairs===\n{{Main|Ranked pairs}}\n\nThe order of finish is constructed a piece at a time by considering the (pairwise) majorities one at a time, from largest majority to smallest majority. For each majority, their higher-ranked candidate is placed ahead of their lower-ranked candidate in the (partially constructed) order of finish, except when their lower-ranked candidate has already been placed ahead of their higher-ranked candidate.\n\nFor example, suppose the voters' orders of preference are such that 75% rank B over C, 65% rank A over B, and 60% rank C over A. (The three majorities are a [[rock paper scissors]] cycle.) Ranked pairs begins with the largest majority, who rank B over C, and places B ahead of C in the order of finish. Then it considers the second largest majority, who rank A over B, and places A ahead of B in the order of finish. At this point, it has been established that A finishes ahead of B and B finishes ahead of C, which implies A also finishes ahead of C. So when ranked pairs considers the third largest majority, who rank C over A, their lower-ranked candidate A has already been placed ahead of their higher-ranked candidate C, so C is not placed ahead of A. The order of finish is \"A, B, C\" and A is the winner.\n\nAn equivalent definition is to find the order of finish that minimizes the size of the largest reversed majority. (In the 'lexicographical order' sense. If the largest majority reversed in two orders of finish is the same, the two orders of finish are compared by their second largest reversed majorities, etc. See [[Lexicographical order|the discussion of MinMax, MinLexMax and Ranked Pairs in the 'Motivation and uses' section of the Lexicographical Order article]]). (In the example, the order of finish \"A, B, C\" reverses the 60% who rank C over A. Any other order of finish would reverse a larger majority.) This definition is useful for simplifying some of the proofs of Ranked Pairs' properties, but the \"constructive\" definition executes much faster (small polynomial time).\n\n===Schulze method===\n{{Main|Schulze method}}\n\nThe [[Schulze method]] resolves votes as follows:\n\n:At each stage, we proceed as follows:\n\n:# For each pair of undropped candidates X and Y: If there is a directed path of undropped links from candidate X to candidate Y, then we write \"X \u2192 Y\"; otherwise we write \"not X \u2192 Y\".\n:# For each pair of undropped candidates V and W: If \"V \u2192 W\" and \"not W \u2192 V\", then candidate W is dropped and all links, that start or end in candidate W, are dropped.\n:# The weakest undropped link is dropped. If several undropped links tie as weakest, all of them are dropped.\n\n:The procedure ends when all links have been dropped. The winners are the undropped candidates.\n\nIn other words, this procedure repeatedly throws away the weakest pairwise defeat within the top set, until finally the number of votes left over produce an unambiguous decision.\n\n===Defeat strength===\nSome pairwise methods\u2014including minimax, Ranked Pairs, and the Schulze method\u2014resolve circular ambiguities based on the relative strength of the defeats. There are different ways to measure the strength of each defeat, and these include considering \"winning votes\" and \"margins\":\n\n*'''Winning votes''': The number of votes on the winning side of a defeat.\n*'''Margins''': The number of votes on the winning side of the defeat, minus the number of votes on the losing side of the defeat.\n\nIf voters do not rank their preferences for all of the candidates, these two approaches can yield different results. Consider, for example, the following election:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!45 voters\n!11 voters\n!15 voters\n!29 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|\n|\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|}\n\nThe pairwise defeats are as follows:\n\n*B beats A, 55 to 45 (55 winning votes, a margin of 10 votes)\n*A beats C, 45 to 44 (45 winning votes, a margin of 1 vote)\n*C beats B, 29 to 26 (29 winning votes, a margin of 3 votes)\n\nUsing the winning votes definition of defeat strength, the defeat of B by C is the weakest, and the defeat of A by B is the strongest. Using the margins definition of defeat strength, the defeat of C by A is the weakest, and the defeat of A by B is the strongest.\n\nUsing winning votes as the definition of defeat strength, candidate B would win under minimax, Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, but, using margins as the definition of defeat strength, candidate C would win in the same methods.\n\nIf all voters give complete rankings of the candidates, then winning votes and margins will always produce the same result. The difference between them can only come into play when some voters declare equal preferences amongst candidates, as occurs implicitly if they do not rank all candidates, as in the example above.\n\nThe choice between margins and winning votes is the subject of scholarly debate. Because all Condorcet methods always choose the Condorcet winner when one exists, the difference between methods only appears when cyclic ambiguity resolution is required. The argument for using winning votes follows from this: Because cycle resolution involves disenfranchising a selection of votes, then the selection should disenfranchise the fewest possible number of votes. When margins are used, the difference between the number of two candidates' votes may be small, but the number of votes may be very large\u2014or not. Only methods employing winning votes satisfy [[plurality criterion|Woodall's plurality criterion]].\n\nAn argument in favour of using margins is the fact that the result of a pairwise comparison is decided by the presence of more votes for one side than the other and thus that it follows naturally to assess the strength of a comparison by this \"surplus\" for the winning side. Otherwise, changing only a few votes from the winner to the loser could cause a sudden large change from a large score for one side to a large score for the other. In other words, one could consider losing votes being in fact disenfranchised when it comes to ambiguity resolution with winning votes. Also, using winning votes, a vote containing ties (possibly implicitly in the case of an incompletely ranked ballot) doesn't have the same effect as a number of equally weighted votes with total weight equaling one vote, such that the ties are broken in every possible way (a violation of [http://www.mcdougall.org.uk/VM/ISSUE3/P5.HTM Woodall's symmetric-completion criterion]), as opposed to margins.\n\nUnder winning votes, if two more of the \"B\" voters decided to vote \"BC\", the A->C arm of the cycle would be overturned and Condorcet would pick C instead of B. This is an example of \"Unburying\" or \"Later does harm\". The margin method would pick C anyway.\n\nUnder the margin method, if three more \"BC\" voters decided to \"bury\" C by just voting \"B\", the A->C arm of the cycle would be strengthened and the resolution strategies would end up breaking the C->B arm and giving the win to B. This is an example of \"Burying\". The winning votes method would pick B anyway.\n\n==Related terms==\nOther terms related to the Condorcet method are:\n;Condorcet loser: the candidate who is less preferred than every other candidate in a pairwise matchup (preferred by fewer voters than any other candidate).\n;Weak Condorcet winner: a candidate who beats or ties with every other candidate in a pairwise matchup (preferred by at least as many voters as any other candidate). There can be more than one weak Condorcet winner.<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-014-0180-4 Weak Condorcet winner(s) revisited \"A weak Condorcet winner (WCW) is an alternative, y, that no majority of voters rank below any other alternative, z, but is not a SCW [Condorcet winner].\"</ref>\n;Weak Condorcet loser: a candidate who is defeated by or ties with every other candidate in a pairwise matchup. Similarly, there can be more than one weak Condorcet loser.\n\n==Condorcet ranking methods==\nSome Condorcet methods produce not just a single winner, but a ranking of all candidates from first to last place. A '''Condorcet ranking''' is a list of candidates with the property that the Condorcet winner (if one exists) comes first and the Condorcet loser (if one exists) comes last, and this holds recursively for the candidates ranked between them.\n\nMethods that satisfy this property include:\n* [[Copeland's method]]\n* [[Kemeny\u2013Young method]]\n* [[Ranked pairs]]\n* [[Schulze method]]\n\nThough there won't always be a Condorcet winner or Condorcet loser, there is always a Smith set and \"Smith loser set\" (smallest group of candidates who lose to all candidates not in the set in head-to-head elections). Some voting methods produce rankings that sort all candidates in the Smith set above all others, and all candidates in the Smith loser set below all others, with this holding recursively for all candidates ranked between them. Because the Smith set and Smith loser set are equivalent to the Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser when they exist, methods that always produce Smith set rankings also always produce Condorcet rankings.\n\n==Comparison with instant runoff and first-past-the-post (plurality)==\n\nMany proponents of [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV) are attracted by the belief that if their first choice does not win, their vote will be given to their second choice; if their second choice does not win, their vote will be given to their third choice, etc. This sounds perfect, but it is not true for every voter with IRV. If someone voted for a strong candidate, and their 2nd and 3rd choices are eliminated before their first choice is eliminated, IRV gives their vote to their 4th choice candidate, not their 2nd choice. [[Condorcet voting]] takes all rankings into account simultaneously, but at the expense of violating the [[later-no-harm criterion]] and the [[later-no-help criterion]]. With IRV, indicating a second choice will never affect your first choice. With Condorcet voting, it is possible that indicating a second choice will cause your first choice to lose.\n\n[[Plurality voting]] is simple, and theoretically provides incentives for voters to compromise for centrist candidates rather than throw away their votes on candidates who can't win. Opponents to plurality voting point out that voters often vote for the lesser of evils because they heard on the news that those two are the only two with a chance of winning, not necessarily because those two are the two natural compromises. This gives the media significant election powers. And if voters do compromise according to the media, the post election counts will prove the media right for next time. Condorcet runs each candidate against the other head to head, so that voters elect the candidate who would win the most sincere runoffs, instead of the one they thought they had to vote for.\n\nThere are circumstances, as in the examples above, when both [[instant-runoff voting]] and the '[[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]]' plurality system will fail to pick the Condorcet winner. (In fact, FPTP can elect the Condorcet loser and IRV can elect the second-worst candidate, who would lose to every candidate except the Condorcet loser.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Nanson|first=E. J.|date=1882|title=Methods of election|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsproc1719roya/page/207|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria|volume=19|pages=207\u2013208|quote=although Ware's method cannot return the worst, it may return the next worst.|via=}}</ref>) In cases where there is a Condorcet Winner, and where IRV does not choose it, a majority would by definition prefer the Condorcet Winner to the IRV winner. Proponents of the Condorcet criterion see it as a principal issue in selecting an electoral system. They see the Condorcet criterion as a natural extension of [[majority rule]]. Condorcet methods tend to encourage the selection of centrist candidates who appeal to the [[median]] voter. Here is an example that is designed to support IRV at the expense of Condorcet:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!499 voters\n!3 voters\n!498 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|3. A\n|}\n\nB is preferred by a 501\u2013499 majority to A, and by a 502\u2013498 majority to C. So, according to the Condorcet criterion, B should win, despite the fact that very few voters rank B in first place. By contrast, IRV elects C and plurality elects A. The goal of a ranked voting system is for voters to be able to vote sincerely and trust the system to protect their intent. Plurality voting forces voters to do all their tactics before they vote, so that the system does not need to figure out their intent.\n\nThe significance of this scenario, of two parties with strong support, and the one with weak support being the Condorcet winner, may be misleading, though, as it is a common mode in plurality voting systems (see [[Duverger's law]]), but much less likely to occur in Condorcet or IRV elections, which unlike Plurality voting, punish candidates who alienate a significant block of voters.\n\nHere is an example that is designed to support Condorcet at the expense of IRV:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!33 voters\n!16 voters\n!16 voters\n!35 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. A\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|3. A\n|}\n\nB would win against either A or C by more than a 65\u201335 margin in a one-on-one election, but IRV eliminates B first, leaving a contest between the more \"polar\" candidates, A and C. Proponents of plurality voting state that their system is simpler than any other and more easily understood.\n\nAll three systems are susceptible to [[tactical voting]], but the types of tactics used and the frequency of strategic incentive differ in each method.\n\n==Potential for tactical voting==\n{{See also|Tactical voting#Condorcet}}\nLike all voting methods,<ref>Satterthwaite, Mark. \"Strategy-proofness and Arrow's conditions: Existence and correspondence theorems for voting procedures and social welfare functions\".</ref> Condorcet methods are vulnerable to [[Tactical voting|compromising]]. That is, voters can help avoid the election of a less-preferred candidate by insincerely raising the position of a more-preferred candidate on their ballot. However, Condorcet methods are only vulnerable to compromising when there is a [[Condorcet cycle|majority rule cycle]], or when one can be created.\n\nMany Condorcet methods are at least somewhat vulnerable to [[Tactical voting|burying]]. That is, voters can help a more-preferred candidate by insincerely lowering the position of a less-preferred candidate on their ballot.\n\nExample with the [[Schulze method]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!46 voters\n!44 voters\n!10 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. A\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|}\n* B is the sincere Condorcet winner. But since A has the most votes and almost has a majority, with A and B forming a [[mutual majority criterion|mutual majority]] of 90% of the voters, A can win by publicly instructing A voters to bury B with C (see * below), using B-top voters' 2nd choice support to win the election. If B, after hearing the public instructions, reciprocates by burying A with C, C will be elected, and this threat may be enough to keep A from pushing for his tactic. B's other possible recourse would be to attack A's ethics in proposing the tactic and call for all voters to vote sincerely. This is an example of the [[Chicken_(game)|chicken dilemma]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!46 voters\n!44 voters\n!10 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. C*\n|2. A\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. B*\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|}\n* B beats A by 8 as before, and A beats C by 82 as before, but ''now'' C beats B by 12, forming a [[Smith set]] greater than one. Even the [[Schulze method]] elects A: The path strength of A beats B is the lesser of 82 and 12, so 12. The path strength of B beats A is only 8, which is less than 12, so A wins. B voters are powerless to do anything about the public announcement by A, and C voters just hope B reciprocates, or maybe consider compromise voting for B if they dislike A enough.\n\nSupporters of Condorcet methods which exhibit this potential problem could rebut this concern by pointing out that pre-election polls are most necessary with [[plurality voting]], and that voters, armed with ranked choice voting, could lie to pre-election pollsters, making it impossible for Candidate A to know whether or how to bury. It is also nearly impossible to predict ahead of time how many supporters of A would actually follow the instructions, and how many would be alienated by such an obvious attempt to manipulate the system.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!33 voters\n!16 voters\n!16 voters\n!35 voters\n|-\n|1. A\n|1. B\n|1. B\n|1. C\n|-\n|2. B\n|2. A\n|2. C\n|2. B\n|-\n|3. C\n|3. C\n|3. A\n|3. A\n|}\n* In the above example, if C voters bury B with A, A will be elected instead of B. Since C voters prefer B to A, only they would be hurt by attempting the burying. Except for the first example where one candidate has the most votes and has a near majority, the Schulze method is very resistant to burying.\n\n==Evaluation by criteria==\n\nScholars of electoral systems often compare them using mathematically defined [[Comparison of electoral systems|voting system criteria]]. The criteria which Condorcet methods satisfy vary from one Condorcet method to another. However, the Condorcet criterion implies the [[majority criterion]]; the Condorcet criterion is incompatible with [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (though it implies a weaker form of the criterion: when there is a Condorcet winner, losing candidates can drop out of the election without changing the result)<ref> https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02973 The Schulze Method of Voting p.351 \"The Condorcet criterion for single-winner elections (section 4.7) is important because, when there is a Condorcet winner b \u2208 A, then it is still a Condorcet winner when alternatives a1,...,an \u2208 A \\ {b} are removed. So an alternative b \u2208 A doesn\u2019t owe his property of being a Condorcet winner to the presence of some other alternatives. Therefore, when we declare a Condorcet winner b \u2208 A elected whenever a Condorcet winner exists, we know that no other alternatives a1,...,an \u2208 A \\ {b} have changed the result of the election without being elected.\"</ref>, [[later-no-harm]], the [[participation criterion]], and the [[consistency criterion]]. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"font-size:90%;line-height:1;\"\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Condorcet<br />method|Voting system<br />criterion}} !!

Organizations which currently use some variant of the Condorcet method are:\n\n* The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] used the [[Schulze method]] to elect its Board of Trustees until 2013, when it switched to a [[ratings ballot]] with Support/Neutral/Oppose ballots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections_2013/Results|title=Wikimedia Foundation elections 2013/Results \u2013 Meta|website=meta.wikimedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>\n* The [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party of Sweden]] uses the [[Schulze method]] for its primaries\n* The [[Debian]] project uses the [[Schulze method]] for internal referenda and to elect its leader\n* The [[Software in the Public Interest]] corporation uses the [[Schulze method]] for internal referenda and to elect its Board of Directors\n* The [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo Foundation]] uses the [[Schulze method]] for internal referenda and to elect its Board of Trustees and its Council\n* The [[Free State Project]] used [[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]] for choosing its target state\n* The [[United Kingdom|uk]].* hierarchy of [[Usenet]]\n* The [[Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia|Student Society of the University of British Columbia]] uses [[ranked pairs]] for its executive elections.\n* [[Kingman Hall]] and [[Hillegass Parker House]], two loosely affiliated [[student housing cooperative]]s, each use the [[Schulze method]] to elect their management teams.\n{{See also|Schulze method#Users|l1=Use of the Schulze method}}\n\n==Other considerations==\n\n* Condorcet election results show the win margins for every head to head runoff. If the Condorcet winner (A) is part of an A beats B beats C beats A [[Smith set]], supporters of Candidate C will know that Candidate C would win a [[recall election]] if candidate B is somehow kept off the ballot. If Condorcet voting is used, the rules for ballot access in recall elections may need to be evaluated to take the potential motives into consideration.\n\n* If every seat in a legislature is elected (in separate elections, by the same pool of voters \u2013 use of districts will avoid this) by the Condorcet method, the legislators would all be centrists and might all agree with each on what laws to pass. Some voters prefer to have opposites in the legislature so they can't pass laws easily. These voters might prefer the Condorcet method for electing executive offices.\n\n* If 10 candidates run for governor in a Condorcet race, ballot counters may need to count 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45 head to head runoffs to find the winner. While this is doable, it might be more practical to still use ballot access laws or primaries, defeating some of the original intent of the Condorcet method. Computers can be used to speed up the counts, though some voters fear computers can be hacked and used for ballot counting fraud. Another option would be to allow several independent scanner owners count the ballots and compare results. Volunteer hand counters could then spot check various candidates and ranks to make sure they match the subtotals reported by the scanners. It is also possible to limit the number of ranks voters can use; for example, if every voter is only allowed to rank each candidate either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, with equal rankings allowed, then only the runoffs between candidates ranked 1st and 2nd, 1st and 3rd, 1st and last, 2nd and 3rd, 2nd and last, and 3rd and last need be counted, as the runoffs between two candidates at the same rank will result in ties.\n\n* If there are no more than 5 candidates ( or a larger number of candidates is short-listed to 5) then the amount of effort counting ballots could be reduced to normal acceptable levels by asking voters to select an order of preference from a predetermined list of the possibilities. This would mean that the ballots would just require to be counted once to determine the number of votes cast for each order of preference. The results would then be entered into a simple spreadsheet which would determine the Condorcet winner.\n\n* Voters make an economic trade-off in the amount of time invested in researching and ranking candidates.  If voters rank too few candidates or [[donkey voting|rank such as to inaccurately represent their preferences]], the Condorcet candidate cannot be correctly discovered. Nominating primaries reduce the number of candidates to avoid this, and the style of nominating primary can impact whether the Condorcet candidate\u2014or at least a similar candidate\u2014remains or if all such candidates are eliminated in favor of polarized options.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n* [[Condorcet loser criterion]]\n* [[Ramon Llull]] (1232\u20131315) who, with the 2001 discovery of his lost manuscripts ''Ars notandi'', ''Ars eleccionis'', and ''Alia ars eleccionis'', was given credit for discovering the Borda count and Condorcet criterion (Llull winner) in the 13th century\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last =  Black | first =  Duncan | title = The Theory of Committees and Elections | url =  https://archive.org/details/theoryofcommitte0000blac | url-access =  registration | publisher =  Cambridge University Press | year = 1958}}\n* {{cite book | last = Farquarson | first = Robin | title = Theory of Voting | location = Oxford | year = 1969}}\n* {{cite book | last = Sen | first = Amartya Kumar| title = Collective Choice and Social Welfare | isbn = 978-0-8162-7765-0 | year = 1970 | publisher = Holden-Day}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- this section contains a lot of links; please try to keep it organized by the author's last name. -->\n* {{Citation | url = http://pj.freefaculty.org/Ukraine/PJ3_VotingSystemsEssay.pdf | title = Voting Systems | first = Paul E | last = Johnson | publisher = Free faculty | accessdate = 2015-06-27}}.\n* {{Citation | url = http://robla.net/1996/politics/condorcet.html | title = Condorcet's Method | first = Robert \u2018Rob\u2019 | last = Lanphier}}.<!-- Broken.
