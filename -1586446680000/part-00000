He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=44}} He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due to not only its aft airstair but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump despite the proximity of the engine exhaust. It had \"single-point fueling\" capability, a then-recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=46}} In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight\u2014a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary\u2014and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=136}} Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] paramilitary units.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=43}}\n\nIn addition to planning his escape, Cooper retrieved the note and wore dark glasses, which indicated that he had a certain level of sophistication in avoiding the things that had aided the identification of the perpetrator of the best-known case of a ransom: the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, [[fence (criminal)|fence]] it at a discount or otherwise profit. Although Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of non-sequentially numbered small bills, mass publicity over the Lindbergh case had long made it public knowledge that even with 1930s technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence brought in only at the trial.<ref>{{cite web|work=Acamstoday|title=The Lindbergh Case: How Bankers Helped Solve It|url=http://www.acamstoday.org/the-lindberg-case-how-banker-helped-solve-it/}}</ref>\n\nAlthough unconscionably perilous by the high safety, training and equipment standards of [[skydiver]]s, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal is a matter of dispute. The author of an overview and comparison of [[World War II]] aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Survival Probability Analysis of the D.B.

The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.\" Furthermore, \"if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.\"<ref name = \"conclusions\" />\n\nThe Bureau was more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. \"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a [[paratrooper]],\" said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. \"We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. A Boeing 727 at flaps 15 degrees and light weight probably flies at 150 knots or 172 mph.

Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] noted that the bills had disintegrated in a \"rounded\" fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}} That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see [[#Later developments|Later developments]] above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nBut the \"free-floating\" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank \"within a couple of years\" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |title=FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 |format=PDF |access-date=April 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035908/http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see [[#Subsequent FBI disclosures|Subsequent FBI disclosures]] above).<ref name=\"conclusions\">\n[http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html ''Research Conclusions'': Cooper Research Team web site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125233029/http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html |date=November 25, 2011 }} .

He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. He did not have room in his truck to pick him up, and continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Caf\u00e9 just outside Cle&nbsp;Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the caf\u00e9 looking like a \"drowned rat\", according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the caf\u00e9. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.\n\nLaurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the caf\u00e9, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him \"Cowboy\".\n\nLaurin consulted a map to find these landmarks and began making phone calls about the \"Cowboy who had driven a dump truck.\" Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_lived_and_died_in_mi.html |title=D.B.

The article theorized that the loss of his pension created a grudge against the corporate establishment and transportation industry. It also created a sudden need for money due to that loss of pension.

Smith and Clair worked together in Newark, New Jersey, at the [[Oak Island Yard]], with Smith retiring as a [[Yardmaster]] for [[Conrail]].

Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. In early 1972, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[John N.

In Seattle, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|Post-Intelligencer]]'' made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=95}} In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the [[Supreme Court of Minnesota|Minnesota Supreme Court]] and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=184}}\n\n===Later developments===\nSubsequent analyses indicated that the original landing zone estimate was inaccurate: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed.<ref name=\"Seven1996-11-17\" /> Additional data from a variety of sources\u2014in particular [[Continental Airlines]] pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305\u2014indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=111\u2013113}} This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the [[Washougal River]].{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=114\u2013116}}\n\n===Investigation suspended===\nOn July 8, 2016, the FBI announced that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence\u2014related specifically to the parachutes or the ransom money\u2014that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at [[FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] On the FBI website, there is currently a 28-part packet full of evidence gathered over the years.

It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=46}} In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight\u2014a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary\u2014and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=136}} Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] paramilitary units.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=43}}\n\nIn addition to planning his escape, Cooper retrieved the note and wore dark glasses, which indicated that he had a certain level of sophistication in avoiding the things that had aided the identification of the perpetrator of the best-known case of a ransom: the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, [[fence (criminal)|fence]] it at a discount or otherwise profit. Although Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of non-sequentially numbered small bills, mass publicity over the Lindbergh case had long made it public knowledge that even with 1930s technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence brought in only at the trial.<ref>{{cite web|work=Acamstoday|title=The Lindbergh Case: How Bankers Helped Solve It|url=http://www.acamstoday.org/the-lindberg-case-how-banker-helped-solve-it/}}</ref>\n\nAlthough unconscionably perilous by the high safety, training and equipment standards of [[skydiver]]s, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal is a matter of dispute. The author of an overview and comparison of [[World War II]] aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Survival Probability Analysis of the D.B.

The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime.\" Furthermore, \"if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans.\"<ref name = \"conclusions\" />\n\nThe Bureau was more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. \"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a [[paratrooper]],\" said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. \"We concluded after a few years this was simply not true.

Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] noted that the bills had disintegrated in a \"rounded\" fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}} That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see [[#Later developments|Later developments]] above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nBut the \"free-floating\" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank \"within a couple of years\" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |title=FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 |format=PDF |access-date=April 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035908/http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see [[#Subsequent FBI disclosures|Subsequent FBI disclosures]] above).<ref name=\"conclusions\">\n[http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html ''Research Conclusions'': Cooper Research Team web site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125233029/http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html |date=November 25, 2011 }} .

Geologist Leonard Palmer of [[Portland State University]] found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the riverbank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}}<ref>{{cite web | title = Cash linked to 'D.B.

Cooper landed near [[Cle Elum, Washington|Cle&nbsp;Elum, Washington]].\n\nAccording to written testimony, Jeff Osiadacz, a Cle&nbsp;Elum, Washington native, was driving his dump truck near Cle&nbsp;Elum the night of November&nbsp;24, 1971, when he saw a man walking down the side of the road in the inclement weather. He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. He did not have room in his truck to pick him up, and continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Caf\u00e9 just outside Cle&nbsp;Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the caf\u00e9 looking like a \"drowned rat\", according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the caf\u00e9. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.\n\nLaurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the caf\u00e9, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him \"Cowboy\".\n\nLaurin consulted a map to find these landmarks and began making phone calls about the \"Cowboy who had driven a dump truck.\" Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_lived_and_died_in_mi.html |title=D.B.

After high school he enlisted in the Navy and volunteered for combat air crew training, citing his desire to fly. After the Navy, he worked for the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], and was impacted by the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]] bankruptcy in 1970, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history up until that time. The article theorized that the loss of his pension created a grudge against the corporate establishment and transportation industry. It also created a sudden need for money due to that loss of pension. In Smith's high school yearbook, a list of alumni killed in World War II lists an Ira Daniel Cooper, possibly the source for the hijacker's given name of \u201cDan Cooper.\u201d<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\"/> The analyst stated that Smith's Naval aviation experience would have given him knowledge of planes and parachutes, and that his railroad experience would have helped him find railroad tracks and hop on a train to escape the area after his jump.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/fresh-db-cooper-theory-emerges-years-after-infamous-hijacking|title=DB Cooper revealed?

Smith and the 1985 book ''D.B. Cooper: What Really Happened'' by [[Max Gunther]].<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\"/>\n\n''The Oregonian'' article states that particles such as aluminum spiral chips found on the clip-on tie could have come from a locomotive maintenance facility. Furthermore, it states that Smith's information about the Seattle area may have come from his close friend from the railroad, Dan Clair, who was stationed at Fort Lewis during World War II. Smith and Clair worked together in Newark, New Jersey, at the [[Oak Island Yard]], with Smith retiring as a [[Yardmaster]] for [[Conrail]]. The article also noted that a website devoted to the Lehigh Valley Railroad contained a picture of Smith, and stated that \u201cthe resemblance to the wanted-poster sketches was remarkable.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lvrr.com/jersey-city-employee/|title=Jersey City Employees|website=Lvrr.com}}</ref> The FBI responded to media requests on Smith by saying it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment about specific suspects.<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\"/>\n\n===Duane Weber===\nDuane L. Weber was a World War II Army veteran who served time in at least six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for burglary and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, \"I am Dan Cooper.\" The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found [[Max Gunther]]'s book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.<ref name=\"Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24\" />\n\nShe then recalled, in retrospect, that Weber once had a nightmare during which he talked in his sleep about jumping from a plane, leaving his fingerprints on the \"aft stairs\".<ref name=\"CrimeLibrary10\">{{cite web | title = The D.B.

Like the hijacker, Weber drank bourbon and chain smoked. Other circumstantial evidence included a 1979 trip to Seattle and the Columbia River, during which Weber took a walk alone along the river bank in the Tina Bar area; four months later Brian Ingram made his ransom cash discovery in the same area.<ref name=\"Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24\" />\n\nThe FBI eliminated Weber as an active suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane,<ref name=\"CrimeLibrary10\" /> and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him.<ref name=\"Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24\" /> Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie,<ref name=\"new\" /><ref name=\"CNN2011-08-01\" /> though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.<ref name=\"no match\" />\n\n==Copycat hijackings==\nCooper was not the first to attempt air piracy for personal gain. In early November 1971, for example, a Canadian man named Paul Joseph Cini hijacked an [[Air Canada]] DC-8 over Montana, but was overpowered by the crew when he put down his shotgun to strap on the parachute he had brought with him.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=94}}<ref>Koerner, B (June 14, 2013).

He also played in the country for [[M\u00e1laga CF|M\u00e1laga]] and [[Levante UD|Levante]], being first-choice and appearing in 151 [[La Liga]] matches over one full decade.\n\nAn [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguayan international]] for six years, Mun\u00faa represented the country at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Nacional===\nBorn in [[Montevideo]], Mun\u00faa started his career at local [[Club Nacional de Football]], where he won four [[Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Uruguyan league]] titles in a row.
