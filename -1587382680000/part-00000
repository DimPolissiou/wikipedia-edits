{"title_page": "1933 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1933 season of [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 25th. The championship was won by [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]]. This was their fifth title having previously won it in [[1913 Auckland Rugby League season|1913]], [[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]], [[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]] and [[1932 Auckland Rugby League season|1932]]. The first two titles were prior to their merger with the nearby [[North Shore Albions|Sunnyside]] club when they were known as [[North Shore Albions]], a name they later reverted to. They finished 1 point ahead of runner up [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] also won the Stormont Shield for the third time following victories in 1930 and 1931. They defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] in the final by 12 points to 7. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] had gained their place in the Stormont Shield match by winning the Roope Rooster with wins over [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] (29\u201315), [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] (10\u20130), and [[City Rovers]] in the final by 26 points to 14. This was [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond's]] third Roope Rooster title following wins in 1926 and 1927. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] were awarded the Thistle Cup for the most competition points scored in the second round.<ref name=\"auto6\">{{cite news |title=Season Trophies |page=15 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=258 |date=1933-11-01 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19331101.2.178 |access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe Challenge Round trophy (awarded to the team with the best second round competition points) was won by the much improved [[Newton Rangers]] after they beat all 5 senior opponents. The Max Jaffe Cup was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] who defeated [[Marist Saints|Marist]] comfortably by 31 to 8, and in a charity match to conclude the season [[Marist Saints|Marist]] reversed this result with a 16 to 5 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]].\n\nIn reserve and lower grade competitions [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] once again shone. The senior reserve competition was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers Reserves]] who finished with a 6 win, 2 draw, 2 loss record. While [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United Reserves]] won the reserve grade knockout competition when they defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] 5 to 4 in the final. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] once again won the Davis Shield with their lower grade teams combining for more competition points than any other club. This was their 11th win in the 13 years that it has been awarded.\n\nIt was a busy season for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative side. They played seven matches for six wins and one loss. Their sole loss came against the [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] (Waikato) side who beat them 14\u20130 at [[Carlaw Park]]. [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] had revenge in their final representative match of the season this time beating [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] by 17 points to 5. Their other wins came over [[Taranaki rugby league team|Taranaki]] (32\u201320 and 25\u201317), [[Northland rugby league team|North Auckland]] (28\u201313), [[West Coast rugby league team|West Coast]] (28\u201322), and [[Hawke's Bay rugby league team|Hawke's Bay]] (47\u201317).\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1932 Auckland Rugby League season|1932]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=25th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1933}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1934 Auckland Rugby League season|1934]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n=== Auckland Rugby League Meetings ===\nGeorge Rhodes announced his resignation of the chairmanship due to business commitments which would require him leaving [[Auckland]] regularly. He died suddenly near the end of the season and was buried at [[Waikumete Cemetery]]. His successor was Mr. G, Grey Campbell, who was a well known member of the City Council, the Transport Board, and other institutions. Rhodes had been chairman of the league for six and a half years. Mr. R. Doble said Mr. Rhodes deserved to be honoured with life membership for his many years service. This was endorsed by several members. Rhodes started out as a groundsman at [[Carlaw Park]] in 1921 before becoming the ground superintendent.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Chairman/Rugby League Head/Retirement of Mr. Rhodes/Mr. Grey Campbell Follows |page=14 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=81 |date=1933-04-06 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330406.2.145 |access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> At the league AGM it was reported that revenue for the year totalled \u00a32,573, of which \u00a31,791 came from gate receipts, \u00a3416 from ground rents, \u00a368 from advertising and \u00a345 from subscriptions. The profit was \u00a3754 9/3, with \u00a3572 1/3 distributed in grant to clubs. After other spending the total profit for the year was \u00a3182 8/. [[James Carlaw|J.

Grey Campbell said the policy of granting gate percentages to senior clubs should be retained. He said that it was up to the clubs to produce a high standard of play and the percentage to senior clubs would be an incentive.<ref name=\"auto8\">{{cite news |title=Board of Control/Club Percentages Retained/Draw for Opening Day |page=16 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=92 |date=1933-04-20 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330420.2.157 |access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\nNear the conclusion of the season the [[Auckland Rugby League]] met and Mr. Campbell said \u201cthe gate receipts to date had been in excess of those last season. Clubs had benefited considerably from the percentage granted, and most senior clubs were now in a position to assist their players next season\u201d. The intention was to carefully manage the finances of the league and \u201cto improve the stand accommodation and give players better dressing facilities\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Successful Season/Finance of Club Teams/St. George and Newton |page=16 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXX| issue=21619 |date=1933-10-11 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19331011.2.196.3 |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' printed an article \u2018reviewing\u2019 the season where they wrote of the visiting [[St George Dragons|St George]] team and the standard of play in [[Auckland]]. They also discussed the possibility of Auckland teams touring Australia.<ref>{{cite news |title=St. George Team\u2019s Visit/Interchange of Tours/Auckland Season Reviewed |page=19 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXX| issue=21625 |date=1933-10-18 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19331018.2.186.1 |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===Junior Management Meeting===\nAt the annual general meeting of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] Junior Management Committee on 21 March the annual report (in reference to the [[1932 Auckland Rugby League season|1932 season]]) was submitted. It stated that there were 1,008 registered players compared with 1,224 the previous season, and 63 teams took the field. The reason for the decline in numbers was put down to the fact that large numbers of people had left [[Auckland]] in search of work during the trying economic times. The report then went on to congratulate teams who had won various trophies in the Junior grades in the 1932 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Junior Management/Success of New Control |page=14 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=68 |date=1933-03-22 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330322.2.141 |access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Senior Competition ===\nIt was decided prior to the season that the reserve grade games would be played before their respective senior teams. This had been requested by clubs as it would help them ensure they had players available for their top side at all times. In spite of this there were no changes ultimately made at all to the scheduling with all senior matches played at [[Carlaw Park]] apart from rare exceptions. One reserve grade match was played at [[Carlaw Park]] most weekends with the other matches usually played at the nearby [[Auckland Domain]].\n\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] decided at a meeting following the first round of the Roope Rooster competition that a new competition for senior teams spread over 5 weeks would take place. With the senior competition having reverted to 6 teams 2 seasons earlier the round robin was over relatively quickly leaving more time later in the season than had previously existed. The matches were to be unique in that they would be of 40 minutes duration with no interval. Most weeks two of the games would be played prior to an inter-provincial match. In the event of a tie the team that had the best for and against record would be declared the winners and a special trophy would be awarded.\n\nIt was also decided that force downs in teams own in goal and kicks that went dead in goal would be worth points in order to speed up the games. These rules were used in an annual competition in [[Sydney]] when there were no representative games on.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite news |title=New Senior Competition/Board\u2019s Decision Approved/Saturday\u2019s Fixtures |page=17 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=181 |date=1933-08-03 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330803.2.167 |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] ultimately won this round and it was a key factor in them being given the opportunity to play against the touring [[St George Dragons|St George]] team.\n\n=== St George Tour ===\nIn September the [[St George Dragons|St George]] team from [[Sydney]] toured the upper North Island. [[St George Dragons|St George]] had finished runner up in the [[1933 NSWRFL season|1933 NSWRFL]]. Their first match was against the Auckland champion [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] team who they defeated 19\u20138. They then played a midweek match with [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] who they lost to 8\u201313 and then [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who they also lost to 11\u201325. Following this they departed on a tour of [[Rotorua]] to see the geothermal sites before playing [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] in [[Taupiri]] where they won by 17 points to 5.<ref>{{cite news |title=Win for St. George/South Auckland Beaten/Seventeen Points to Five |page=10 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=236 |date=1933-10-06 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19331006.2.135 |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> They then travelled to [[New Plymouth]] where they had a 22 points to 14 win over Taranaki.<ref>{{cite news |title=St. George Win |page=14 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=238 |date=1933-10-09 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19331009.2.182 |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> [[St George Dragons|St George]] returned to [[Auckland]] to complete their tour where they played [[Newton Rangers]] in a midweek match which they won 30 points to 23, followed by a return match with [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] on the Saturday. There had been some debate as to who the last match would be played against. [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] had had a solid season putting in some strong performances and they were arguably the most improved side in [[Auckland]]. They had also been the first club to request a match with the touring side however the strongest performing sides had all been matched up with [[St George Dragons|St George]] first and this last match of the tour was only confirmed at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news |title=St. George\u2019s Sixth Match |page=12 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=239 |date=1933-10-10 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19331010.2.117 |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> Following the match with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] the [[St George Dragons|St George]] team was entertained by the [[New Zealand Rugby League]] at a dinner.

These were, that the No. 2 ground be available for practice regardless \u201cof the weather, that the stone wall at the end of No. 2 ground beside the terraces should be covered to protect players; that the scoreboard should be raised; that people should be stopped from jumping the terrace fence at the conclusion of the main match; that the transport Board be asked to extend the penny section from the railway station to the Stanley Street stop...\u201d. It was also decided to issue tickets for the admission of unemployed to [[Carlaw Park]], with the official co-operation of the Auckland Provincial Unemployed Association.<ref>{{cite news |title=Board of Control/Motion of Condolence/Transfers and Registrations |page=15 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=97 |date=1933-04-27 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330427.2.147 |access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> After it was found that this system was being abused with the tickets being on sold it was decided to charge the unemployed but at a reduced rate of sixpence. Those trying to enter under this system had to produce their unemployment levy book containing an official stamp and a special turn-style was to be used to admit them.

It was felt that \u201cscrummaging was not satisfactory, particularly with regard to hooking and other infringements around the scrum\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |title=Meeting of Referees/Putting Ball in Scrums |page=12 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=125 |date=1933-05-30 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330530.2.128 |access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Matches on 2 June featured this new rule change and it was commentated from referees that it had so far improved play around scrums and eliminated a lot of whistle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Referees Meeting |page=13 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=131 |date=1933-06-06 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330606.2.150 |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> It was however decided at a meeting of the New Zealand Council several weeks later that the practice was to be discontinued after acting on the recommendation of the New Zealand Referees\u2019 Association. It was also noted that a player when falling on the ball in the in goal area needed to ground the ball with their hands and it was play on until this was done so. The play the ball rule was said to be being better controlled with the \u201csame command as evident in a boxing match, when a referee called \u2018break\u2019 and the contenders were bound to obey\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |title=Affairs of Referees |page=13 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=155 |date=1933-07-04 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330704.2.149 |access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref>\n\nThe League Council advised that the forward pass rule was being ruled incorrectly with players being penalised for being offside when receiving a forward pass. As the players had inadvertently got in front of the teammate passing the ball it was clarified that it should be considered a forward pass only and therefore a scrum rather than a penalty. The board approved of this interpretation and referred it to the Referees\u2019 Association.<ref>{{cite news |title=Auckland Control/Referees and the Scrums/Arrangements for Saturday |page=16 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=127 |date=1933-06-01 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330601.2.145 |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Radio Coverage of Matches ===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] decided to forward a motion of protest from [[Ted Phelan]] to the New Zealand Government regarding the ban on the 1ZR station.

The championship was won by [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]]. This was their fifth title having previously won it in [[1913 Auckland Rugby League season|1913]], [[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]], [[1928 Auckland Rugby League season|1928]] and [[1932 Auckland Rugby League season|1932]]. The first two titles were prior to their merger with the nearby [[North Shore Albions|Sunnyside]] club when they were known as [[North Shore Albions]], a name they later reverted to. They finished 1 point ahead of runner up [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] also won the Stormont Shield for the third time following victories in 1930 and 1931. They defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] in the final by 12 points to 7. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] had gained their place in the Stormont Shield match by winning the Roope Rooster with wins over [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] (29\u201315), [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] (10\u20130), and [[City Rovers]] in the final by 26 points to 14.

The Max Jaffe Cup was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] who defeated [[Marist Saints|Marist]] comfortably by 31 to 8, and in a charity match to conclude the season [[Marist Saints|Marist]] reversed this result with a 16 to 5 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]].\n\nIn reserve and lower grade competitions [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] once again shone. The senior reserve competition was won by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers Reserves]] who finished with a 6 win, 2 draw, 2 loss record. While [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United Reserves]] won the reserve grade knockout competition when they defeated [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] 5 to 4 in the final. [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] once again won the Davis Shield with their lower grade teams combining for more competition points than any other club. This was their 11th win in the 13 years that it has been awarded.\n\nIt was a busy season for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative side. They played seven matches for six wins and one loss. Their sole loss came against the [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] (Waikato) side who beat them 14\u20130 at [[Carlaw Park]].

It stated that there were 1,008 registered players compared with 1,224 the previous season, and 63 teams took the field. The reason for the decline in numbers was put down to the fact that large numbers of people had left [[Auckland]] in search of work during the trying economic times. The report then went on to congratulate teams who had won various trophies in the Junior grades in the 1932 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Junior Management/Success of New Control |page=14 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=68 |date=1933-03-22 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330322.2.141 |access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Senior Competition ===\nIt was decided prior to the season that the reserve grade games would be played before their respective senior teams. This had been requested by clubs as it would help them ensure they had players available for their top side at all times. In spite of this there were no changes ultimately made at all to the scheduling with all senior matches played at [[Carlaw Park]] apart from rare exceptions. One reserve grade match was played at [[Carlaw Park]] most weekends with the other matches usually played at the nearby [[Auckland Domain]].\n\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] decided at a meeting following the first round of the Roope Rooster competition that a new competition for senior teams spread over 5 weeks would take place. With the senior competition having reverted to 6 teams 2 seasons earlier the round robin was over relatively quickly leaving more time later in the season than had previously existed. The matches were to be unique in that they would be of 40 minutes duration with no interval. Most weeks two of the games would be played prior to an inter-provincial match. In the event of a tie the team that had the best for and against record would be declared the winners and a special trophy would be awarded.\n\nIt was also decided that force downs in teams own in goal and kicks that went dead in goal would be worth points in order to speed up the games. These rules were used in an annual competition in [[Sydney]] when there were no representative games on.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite news |title=New Senior Competition/Board\u2019s Decision Approved/Saturday\u2019s Fixtures |page=17 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=181 |date=1933-08-03 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330803.2.167 |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] ultimately won this round and it was a key factor in them being given the opportunity to play against the touring [[St George Dragons|St George]] team.\n\n=== St George Tour ===\nIn September the [[St George Dragons|St George]] team from [[Sydney]] toured the upper North Island. [[St George Dragons|St George]] had finished runner up in the [[1933 NSWRFL season|1933 NSWRFL]].

These were, that the No. 2 ground be available for practice regardless \u201cof the weather, that the stone wall at the end of No. 2 ground beside the terraces should be covered to protect players; that the scoreboard should be raised; that people should be stopped from jumping the terrace fence at the conclusion of the main match; that the transport Board be asked to extend the penny section from the railway station to the Stanley Street stop...\u201d. It was also decided to issue tickets for the admission of unemployed to [[Carlaw Park]], with the official co-operation of the Auckland Provincial Unemployed Association.<ref>{{cite news |title=Board of Control/Motion of Condolence/Transfers and Registrations |page=15 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=97 |date=1933-04-27 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330427.2.147 |access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> After it was found that this system was being abused with the tickets being on sold it was decided to charge the unemployed but at a reduced rate of sixpence. Those trying to enter under this system had to produce their unemployment levy book containing an official stamp and a special turn-style was to be used to admit them.

It was felt that \u201cscrummaging was not satisfactory, particularly with regard to hooking and other infringements around the scrum\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |title=Meeting of Referees/Putting Ball in Scrums |page=12 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=125 |date=1933-05-30 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330530.2.128 |access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Matches on 2 June featured this new rule change and it was commentated from referees that it had so far improved play around scrums and eliminated a lot of whistle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Referees Meeting |page=13 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=131 |date=1933-06-06 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330606.2.150 |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> It was however decided at a meeting of the New Zealand Council several weeks later that the practice was to be discontinued after acting on the recommendation of the New Zealand Referees\u2019 Association. It was also noted that a player when falling on the ball in the in goal area needed to ground the ball with their hands and it was play on until this was done so. The play the ball rule was said to be being better controlled with the \u201csame command as evident in a boxing match, when a referee called \u2018break\u2019 and the contenders were bound to obey\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |title=Affairs of Referees |page=13 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=155 |date=1933-07-04 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330704.2.149 |access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref>\n\nThe League Council advised that the forward pass rule was being ruled incorrectly with players being penalised for being offside when receiving a forward pass. As the players had inadvertently got in front of the teammate passing the ball it was clarified that it should be considered a forward pass only and therefore a scrum rather than a penalty. The board approved of this interpretation and referred it to the Referees\u2019 Association.<ref>{{cite news |title=Auckland Control/Referees and the Scrums/Arrangements for Saturday |page=16 |work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LXIV| issue=127 |date=1933-06-01 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19330601.2.145 |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Radio Coverage of Matches ===\nThe [[Auckland Rugby League]] decided to forward a motion of protest from [[Ted Phelan]] to the New Zealand Government regarding the ban on the 1ZR station.

Under the government's \"''Gypsy and Traveller Sites Grant''\", designated sites for Travellers' use are provided by councils, and funds are made available to local authorities for the construction of new sites and maintenance and extension of existing sites.\n\nHowever, Travellers make frequent use of other, non-authorised sites.  These include public \"[[common land]]\" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was [[Dale Farm]] in Essex. The Travellers claim that there is an under-provision of authorised sites. The Gypsy Council estimates an under-provision amounts to insufficient sites for 3,500 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4213875.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Councils 'must find Gypsy sites'|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2005-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThe passing of the [[Caravan Sites Act 1968]], for some time, safeguarded their right to a site, but the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] repealed part II of the 1968 act, removing the duty on local authorities in the UK to provide sites for Travellers and giving them the power to close down existing sites.

These include public \"[[common land]]\" and private plots such as large fields and other privately owned land. A famous example was [[Dale Farm]] in Essex.

Borgia spent his early career as a professor of law at the University of Lleida; he later served as a diplomat for the [[kings of Aragon]]. He became a tutor for [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso V]]'s illegitimate son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]. After arranging a reconciliation between Alfonso and [[Pope Martin V]], Borgia was made Bishop of Valencia. In 1444, [[Pope Eugene IV]] named him a cardinal, and Borgia became a member of the Roman Curia. During the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], Callixtus initiated the custom that bells be rung at midday to remind the faithful to pray for the crusaders. The tradition of the noon bell still exists in some congregations. He was also responsible for the retrial of [[Joan of Arc]] that saw her vindicated. He appointed two [[cardinal nephew|nephews as cardinals]], one of whom became [[Pope Alexander VI]].\n\n==Family==\nAlfonso de Borgia was born in La Torreta in 1378. La Torreta was at the time in the [[Se\u00f1or\u00edo de Torre de Canals]] (but is now a neighborhood of [[Canals, Valencia|Canals]] in [[Valencia]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://palomatorrijos.blogspot.hk/2013/06/anna-y-canals-valencia.html |title=Anna y Canals.

His early career was spent as a professor of [[law]] at the University of Lleida. Around 1411, he attended a sermon by [[Vincent Ferrer]]. Afterward, the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] said to the future pope: \"My son, you one day will be called to be the ornament of your house and of your country. You will be invested with the highest dignity that can fall to the lot of man. After my death, I shall be the object of your special honour.

Because of this he went to Barcelona as a representative of his diocese in a synod. Borgia cared strongly for the reestablishment of the unity of the church and his influence with the Aragonese monarch was the factor that allowed for the conclusion of the accord between the king and the new pope. \n\nIn 1418 he was named as the rector of San Nicolas of Valencia. He was also the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lerida from 1420 to 1423. In 1424 he resigned his position and dedicated his service to the Aragonese king. In 1424 he was named as the apostolic administrator of the see of Mallorca. It was at that time that the king desired that he be made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]; [[Pope Martin V]] refused the request. During the [[Great Western Schism]] he supported [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] and was also the driving force behind [[Antipope Clement VIII]]'s submission to [[Pope Martin V]] in 1429.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard P. |last=McBrien |title=Lives of the Popes: The pontiffs from St Peter to John Paul II |location=San Francisco |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2000 |page=[https://archive.org/details/livesofpopes00mcbr/page/260 260] |isbn=978-0060653040 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofpopes00mcbr/page/260 }}</ref> He then served as a diplomat to the Kings of [[Aragon]], especially during the [[Council of Basel]] (1431\u20131439).\n\n==Episcopate and cardinalate==\n[[File:BORJA ALFONSO.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal Borgia]]\nBorgia was appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|Bishop of Valencia]] by [[Pope Martin V]] on 20 August 1429 and was [[episcopal consecration|consecrated]] on 31 August 1429.

He was elevated as the [[Santi Quattro Coronati|Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quattro Coronati]]. He took up his official residence in [[Rome]] and was a member of the [[Roman Curia]]. He participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1447|papal conclave of 1447]] that saw the election of [[Pope Nicholas V]]. He was known for an austere and charitable life.\n\nBorgia's [[coat of arms]] after he was consecrated featured a grazing ox. As pope it remained the same.\n\n==Pontificate==\nBorgia was elected [[pope]] at an advanced age as a \"compromise candidate\" in the [[Papal conclave, 1455|conclave of 8 April 1455]]. He took the pontifical name Callixtus III.<ref name=MacCaffrey/> He was [[papal coronation|crowned]] on 20 April 1455 by Cardinal [[Protodeacon]] [[Prospero Colonna (cardinal)|Prospero Colonna]].\n\nNot quite two years after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], Callixtus was chiefly concerned with the organization of Christian Europe against an invasion by the Turks. An extensive building program under way in Rome was cancelled and the money funneled toward a crusade. [[Papal nuncio]]s were dispatched to all the countries of Europe to beseech the princes to join once more in an effort to check the danger of a Turkish invasion. Missionaries were sent to [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Portugal]], and Aragon to preach the Crusade, and to engage the prayers of the faithful for the success of the enterprise. It was by order of Callixtus III that the bells were rung at midday to remind the faithful that they should pray for the welfare of the crusaders.<ref name=MacCaffrey/>\n\nThe princes of Europe were slow in responding to the call of the pope, largely due to national rivalries. England and France's [[Hundred Years' War]] had just ended in 1453. Forces led by [[John Hunyadi]] ({{lang-hu|Hunyadi J\u00e1nos}}), Captain-General of Hungary, met the Turks and defeated them at [[Belgrade]] (22 July 1456). Shortly after his victory, Hunyadi himself died of a fever.<ref name=MacCaffrey/> On 29 June 1456, Callixtus III ordered the church bells to be rung at noon (see [[noon bell]]) as a call to prayer for the welfare of those defending [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Belgrade]]. To commemorate this victory, Callixtus III ordered the [[Feast of the Transfiguration]] to be held annually on 6 August.\n\n[[File:Bolla papale di callisto III sulla restituzione di beni al convento della sambuca, roma 20 giugno 1455.jpg|thumb|A bull of Callixtus III]]\nIn 1456 the pope issued the [[papal bull]] ''Inter Caetera'' (not to be confused with ''Inter Caetera'' of 1493), reaffirming the earlier bulls ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' and ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' which recognized Portugal's trade rights in territories it had discovered along the West African coast.

Borgia spent his early career as a professor of law at the University of Lleida; he later served as a diplomat for the [[kings of Aragon]]. He became a tutor for [[Alfonso V of Aragon|King Alfonso V]]'s illegitimate son [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]]. After arranging a reconciliation between Alfonso and [[Pope Martin V]], Borgia was made Bishop of Valencia. In 1444, [[Pope Eugene IV]] named him a cardinal, and Borgia became a member of the Roman Curia. During the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)]], Callixtus initiated the custom that bells be rung at midday to remind the faithful to pray for the crusaders. The tradition of the noon bell still exists in some congregations. He was also responsible for the retrial of [[Joan of Arc]] that saw her vindicated. He appointed two [[cardinal nephew|nephews as cardinals]], one of whom became [[Pope Alexander VI]].\n\n==Family==\nAlfonso de Borgia was born in La Torreta in 1378.

His early career was spent as a professor of [[law]] at the University of Lleida. Around 1411, he attended a sermon by [[Vincent Ferrer]]. Afterward, the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] said to the future pope: \"My son, you one day will be called to be the ornament of your house and of your country. You will be invested with the highest dignity that can fall to the lot of man. After my death, I shall be the object of your special honour.

Because of this he went to Barcelona as a representative of his diocese in a synod. Borgia cared strongly for the reestablishment of the unity of the church and his influence with the Aragonese monarch was the factor that allowed for the conclusion of the accord between the king and the new pope. \n\nIn 1418 he was named as the rector of San Nicolas of Valencia. He was also the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lerida from 1420 to 1423. In 1424 he resigned his position and dedicated his service to the Aragonese king. In 1424 he was named as the apostolic administrator of the see of Mallorca. It was at that time that the king desired that he be made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]; [[Pope Martin V]] refused the request. During the [[Great Western Schism]] he supported [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] and was also the driving force behind [[Antipope Clement VIII]]'s submission to [[Pope Martin V]] in 1429.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard P. |last=McBrien |title=Lives of the Popes: The pontiffs from St Peter to John Paul II |location=San Francisco |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2000 |page=[https://archive.org/details/livesofpopes00mcbr/page/260 260] |isbn=978-0060653040 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/livesofpopes00mcbr/page/260 }}</ref> He then served as a diplomat to the Kings of [[Aragon]], especially during the [[Council of Basel]] (1431\u20131439).\n\n==Episcopate and cardinalate==\n[[File:BORJA ALFONSO.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cardinal Borgia]]\nBorgia was appointed [[Bishop of Valencia]] by [[Pope Martin V]] on 20 August 1429 and was [[episcopal consecration|consecrated]] on 31 August 1429.

He was elevated as the [[Santi Quattro Coronati|Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quattro Coronati]]. He took up his official residence in [[Rome]] and was a member of the [[Roman Curia]]. He participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1447|papal conclave of 1447]] that saw the election of [[Pope Nicholas V]]. He was known for an austere and charitable life.\n\nBorgia's [[coat of arms]] after he was consecrated featured a grazing ox. As pope it remained the same.\n\n==Pontificate==\nBorgia was elected [[pope]] at an advanced age as a \"compromise candidate\" in the [[Papal conclave, 1455|conclave of 8 April 1455]]. He took the pontifical name Callixtus III.<ref name=MacCaffrey/> He was [[papal coronation|crowned]] on 20 April 1455 by Cardinal [[Protodeacon]] [[Prospero Colonna (cardinal)|Prospero Colonna]].\n\nNot quite two years after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], Callixtus was chiefly concerned with the organization of Christian Europe against an invasion by the Turks. An extensive building program under way in Rome was cancelled and the money funneled toward a crusade. [[Papal nuncio]]s were dispatched to all the countries of Europe to beseech the princes to join once more in an effort to check the danger of a Turkish invasion. Missionaries were sent to [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Portugal]], and Aragon to preach the Crusade, and to engage the prayers of the faithful for the success of the enterprise. It was by order of Callixtus III that the bells were rung at midday to remind the faithful that they should pray for the welfare of the crusaders.<ref name=MacCaffrey/>\n\nThe princes of Europe were slow in responding to the call of the pope, largely due to national rivalries. England and France's [[Hundred Years' War]] had just ended in 1453. Forces led by [[John Hunyadi]] ({{lang-hu|Hunyadi J\u00e1nos}}), Captain-General of Hungary, met the Turks and defeated them at [[Belgrade]] (22 July 1456). Shortly after his victory, Hunyadi himself died of a fever.<ref name=MacCaffrey/> On 29 June 1456, Callixtus III ordered the church bells to be rung at noon (see [[noon bell]]) as a call to prayer for the welfare of those defending [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Belgrade]]. To commemorate this victory, Callixtus III ordered the [[Feast of the Transfiguration]] to be held annually on 6 August.\n\n[[File:Bolla papale di callisto III sulla restituzione di beni al convento della sambuca, roma 20 giugno 1455.jpg|thumb|A bull of Callixtus III]]\nIn 1456 the pope issued the [[papal bull]] ''Inter Caetera'' (not to be confused with ''Inter Caetera'' of 1493), reaffirming the earlier bulls ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' and ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' which recognized Portugal's trade rights in territories it had discovered along the West African coast.
