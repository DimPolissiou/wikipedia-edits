However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie. All last for 12 months and contain inactivated strains of VHD. A live combination vaccine, Nobivac Myxo-RHD, made by MSD Animal Health, has recently become available.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie. All last for 12 months and contain inactivated strains of VHD. A live combination vaccine, Nobivac Myxo-RHD, made by MSD Animal Health, has recently become available.
