A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as a [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia State Senator]] from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th [[List of governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]] from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in co-founding the [[Carter Center]].\n\nRaised in [[Plains, Georgia]], Carter graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and joined the [[United States Navy]], where he served on [[submarine]]s. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters' peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and support the growing [[civil rights movement]]. He became an activist within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the [[Georgia State Senate]], and in [[1970 Georgia gubernatorial election|1970]], he was elected as [[Governor of Georgia]], defeating former Governor [[Carl Sanders]] in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating [[affirmative action]] for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a [[Dark horse|dark-horse candidate]] who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic presidential nomination]]. In the [[1976 United States presidential election|general election]], Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]]. \n\nOn his second day in office, Carter [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]] all the [[Draft evasion|Vietnam War draft evaders]]. During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], were established. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and the return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent [[stagflation]], a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979\u20131981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the [[Cold War]] when he ended [[d\u00e9tente]], imposed [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|a grain embargo against the Soviets]], enunciated the [[Carter Doctrine]], and led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. Carter lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|general election]] to Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in an electoral landslide. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Polls of historians and political scientists]] usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.\n\nIn 1982, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] charity. He has written [[Bibliography of Jimmy Carter|over 30 books]] ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. The earliest-serving of the five [[Living presidents of the United States|living U.S. presidents]], Carter is the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]], the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|Carter (around age 13) with his dog, Bozo, in 1937]]\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium (now the [[Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]], a hospital where his mother was employed as a registered nurse. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" /> He was the eldest son of [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian]] ({{nee|Gordy}}) and [[James Earl Carter Sr.]] Carter is a descendant of [[English people|English]] immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in [[Virginia]] in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Carter is also a descendant of [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]], an ancestor of [[Cornell University]]'s founder, and is distantly related to [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Bill Gates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html|title=Ancestry of Sen.

Carter's father was a successful local businessman, who ran a [[general store]], and was an investor in farmland.<ref name=\"bourne-114\">Bourne, p. 114.</ref> He previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"bourne-114\">Bourne, p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe family moved several times during Carter Jr.'s infancy.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\">Bourne, pp. 11\u201332.</ref> The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby [[Archery, Georgia|Archery]], which was almost entirely populated by impoverished [[African American]] families. They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro-[[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" />\n\n===Education===\nCarter attended the Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Jimmy was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a [[hot rod]]. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian anyway.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\">Bourne, pp. 33\u201343.</ref> Carter's teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\" />\n\n==Naval career==\nCarter had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. The following year, he transferred to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, and he achieved admission to the Naval Academy in 1943. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, the friend of his sister Ruth. The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.<ref>Bourne, pp. 44\u201355.</ref> He was a [[sprint football]] player for the [[Navy Midshipmen]].<ref name=\"hingston20160424\">{{cite news |url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/04/24/princeton-sprint-football-team/ | title=Why This Princeton Football Team Won't Be Suiting Up Next Season |work=Philadelphia | date=April 24, 2016 | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=Hingston, Sandy}}</ref> Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref name=\"annualRegister19461947\">Annual Register of the United States Naval Academy (v. 1946\u20131947), p. 33</ref> From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his deployments in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].<ref name=\"zelizer-11\">Zelizer, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> In 1948, he began officers' training for submarine duty and served aboard {{USS|Pomfret|SS-391|6}}.

His intent was to eventually work aboard {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}, which was planned to be one of the first two U.S. nuclear submarines. However, Carter's father died two months before construction of ''Seawolf'' began, and Carter sought and obtained a release from active duty to enable him to take over the family peanut business. Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult. Settling after moving so much, Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life. Returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward,\" she said later. On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father's.

However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in [[public housing]] in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in subsidized housing before he took office. Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult because his first-year harvest failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.

Callaway had just switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1964, and was a very strong candidate, despite being the first Republican to run for Governor of Georgia since 1876.  State Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Carter decided to run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran against the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative segregationist [[Lester Maddox]]. In a press conference he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road.&nbsp;... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"<ref>Bourne, pp. 149\u2013153.</ref> He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a [[two-round system|runoff election]] with Maddox. Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall to the Democratic Party nomination. In the general election, Callaway went on to win a plurality of the vote, but short of a 50 percent majority, state rules empowered the Georgia House of Representatives, which had a Democratic Party majority, to elect Maddox as governor.<ref name=\"bourne-153\" /> The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome.<ref name=\"bourne-153\">Bourne, pp. 153\u2013165.</ref>\n\nCarter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], he declared himself [[Born again]], a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child [[Amy Carter|Amy]] was born during this time, on October 19, 1967.<ref>Bourne, pp. 165\u2013179.</ref><ref>Hayward, pp. 39\u201346.</ref>\n\n[[File:GACountiesGovernor1970.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A map of Georgia counties, almost all of which are medium to dark blue with a small handful of red counties in the north|Results of the 1970 gubernatorial election in Georgia, with blue counties supporting Carter and red ones voting for [[Hal Suit]]: the relative darkness of the shade shows greater support for a candidate.]]\n\nGovernor Maddox was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term as governor, and thus the liberal former governor, [[Carl Sanders]], became Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than before. He positioned himself as a [[populism|populist]], quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him \"Cufflinks Carl\") and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.<ref name=\"bourne-180\">Bourne, pp. 180\u2013199.</ref><ref name=\"hayward-46\">Hayward, pp. 46\u201351.</ref> Throughout the campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the \"Wallace vote,\" after the prominent segregationist [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools, depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.<ref name=\"bourne-180\" /><ref name=\"hayward-46\" />\n\nThat September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The subsequent campaign grew even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's campaign criticized Sanders for supporting [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote\u2014winning 7 percent of the black vote\u2014and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican [[Hal Suit]], a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter changed his tone, and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. [[Leroy Johnson (Georgia politician)|Leroy Johnson]], a black state Senator, voiced his support for Carter, saying, \"I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign.&nbsp;...

In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states.

For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Carter's national security adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] that \"if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate [[Baluchistan]]&nbsp;...

The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official [[Robert Gates]], \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\" thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"<ref name=\"Riedel\"/><ref name=\"Gates\">{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Bob |title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007 |isbn=9781416543367 |pp=145\u2013147 |language=en}} When asked whether he expected that the revelations in his memoir (combined with an apocryphal quote attributed to Brzezinski) would inspire \"a mind-bending number of conspiracy theories which adamantly\u2014and wrongly\u2014accuse the Carter Administration of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan,\" Gates replied: \"No, because there was no basis in fact for an allegation the administration tried to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan militarily.\" See Gates, email communication with John Bernell White Jr., October 15, 2011, as cited in {{cite thesis |last=White |first=John Bernell |url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |title=The Strategic Mind Of Zbigniew Brzezinski: How A Native Pole Used Afghanistan To Protect His Homeland |date=May 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |pp=45\u201346, 82 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022857/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |language=en}} cf. {{cite book |authorlink=Steve Coll |last=Coll |first=Steve |title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |year=2004 |isbn=9781594200076 |p=[https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll/page/581 581] |quote=Contemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail.&nbsp;...

What led Carter to take this action was a doctrinal statement by the Convention, adopted in June 2000, advocating a [[Biblical literalism|literal interpretation of the Bible]]. This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: \"an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them.\" ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action \"the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=October 21, 2000 |title=Carter Sadly Turns Back On National Baptist Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment. He said that the view that women are inferior is not confined to one faith, \"nor, tragically does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple.\" Carter stated:\n\n{{quote|The truth is that male religious leaders have had\u2014and still have\u2014an option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women. They have, for their own selfish ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter.

farmer who served as the 39th [[president of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as a [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia State Senator]] from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th [[List of governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]] from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in co-founding the [[Carter Center]].\n\nRaised in [[Plains, Georgia]], Carter graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and joined the [[United States Navy]], where he served on [[submarine]]s. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters' peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and support the growing [[civil rights movement]]. He became an activist within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the [[Georgia State Senate]], and in [[1970 Georgia gubernatorial election|1970]], he was elected as [[Governor of Georgia]], defeating former Governor [[Carl Sanders]] in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating [[affirmative action]] for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a [[Dark horse|dark-horse candidate]] who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic presidential nomination]]. In the [[1976 United States presidential election|general election]], Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]]. \n\nOn his second day in office, Carter [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]] all the [[Draft evasion|Vietnam War draft evaders]]. During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], were established. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and the return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent [[stagflation]], a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979\u20131981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the [[Cold War]] when he ended [[d\u00e9tente]], imposed [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|a grain embargo against the Soviets]], enunciated the [[Carter Doctrine]], and led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. Carter lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|general election]] to Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in an electoral landslide. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Polls of historians and political scientists]] usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.\n\nIn 1982, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] charity. He has written [[Bibliography of Jimmy Carter|over 30 books]] ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. The earliest-serving of the five [[Living presidents of the United States|living U.S. presidents]], Carter is the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]], the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|Carter (around age 13) with his dog, Bozo, in 1937]]\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium (now the [[Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]], a hospital where his mother was employed as a registered nurse. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" /> He was the eldest son of [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian]] ({{nee|Gordy}}) and [[James Earl Carter Sr.]] Carter is a descendant of [[English people|English]] immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in [[Virginia]] in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Carter is also a descendant of [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]], an ancestor of [[Cornell University]]'s founder, and is distantly related to [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Bill Gates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html|title=Ancestry of Sen. John Kerry|website=www.wargs.com|access-date=May 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:17 02 111 carter.jpg|thumb|left|The Carter family store (part of [[Jimmy Carter National Historic Site|Carter's Boyhood Farm]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]]]]\nPlains was a [[boomtown]] of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. Carter's father was a successful local businessman, who ran a [[general store]], and was an investor in farmland.<ref name=\"bourne-114\">Bourne, p. 114.</ref> He previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"bourne-114\">Bourne, p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe family moved several times during Carter Jr.'s infancy.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\">Bourne, pp. 11\u201332.</ref> The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby [[Archery, Georgia|Archery]], which was almost entirely populated by impoverished [[African American]] families. They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro-[[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" />\n\n===Education===\nCarter attended the Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Jimmy was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a [[hot rod]]. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian anyway.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\">Bourne, pp. 33\u201343.</ref> Carter's teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\" />\n\n==Naval career==\nCarter had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. The following year, he transferred to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, and he achieved admission to the Naval Academy in 1943.

Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult because his first-year harvest failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat.

Callaway had just switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1964, and was a very strong candidate, despite being the first Republican to run for Governor of Georgia since 1876.  State Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Carter decided to run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran against the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative segregationist [[Lester Maddox]]. In a press conference he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road.&nbsp;... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"<ref>Bourne, pp. 149\u2013153.</ref> He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a [[two-round system|runoff election]] with Maddox. Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall to the Democratic Party nomination. In the general election, Callaway went on to win a plurality of the vote, but short of a 50 percent majority, state rules empowered the Georgia House of Representatives, which had a Democratic Party majority, to elect Maddox as governor.<ref name=\"bourne-153\" /> The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome.<ref name=\"bourne-153\">Bourne, pp. 153\u2013165.</ref>\n\nCarter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], he declared himself [[Born again]], a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child [[Amy Carter|Amy]] was born during this time, on October 19, 1967.<ref>Bourne, pp. 165\u2013179.</ref><ref>Hayward, pp. 39\u201346.</ref>\n\n[[File:GACountiesGovernor1970.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A map of Georgia counties, almost all of which are medium to dark blue with a small handful of red counties in the north|Results of the 1970 gubernatorial election in Georgia, with blue counties supporting Carter and red ones voting for [[Hal Suit]]: the relative darkness of the shade shows greater support for a candidate.]]\n\nGovernor Maddox was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term as governor, and thus the liberal former governor, [[Carl Sanders]], became Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than before. He positioned himself as a [[populism|populist]], quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him \"Cufflinks Carl\") and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.<ref name=\"bourne-180\">Bourne, pp. 180\u2013199.</ref><ref name=\"hayward-46\">Hayward, pp. 46\u201351.</ref> Throughout the campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the \"Wallace vote,\" after the prominent segregationist [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools, depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.<ref name=\"bourne-180\" /><ref name=\"hayward-46\" />\n\nThat September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The subsequent campaign grew even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's campaign criticized Sanders for supporting [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote\u2014winning 7 percent of the black vote\u2014and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican [[Hal Suit]], a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter changed his tone, and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics.

Looking toward a potential presidential run, Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]], where the liberal U.S. Senator [[George McGovern]] was the likely presidential nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative, anti-McGovern voters, so that the convention would consider him for McGovern's running mate on a compromise ticket. He endorsed Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson]], in part to distance himself from George Wallace. Carter was still fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 Democratic ticket]] went to McGovern and Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]].<ref>Bourne, pp. 221\u2013230.</ref>{{refn|Eagleton was later replaced on the ticket by [[Sargent Shriver]].|group=note}} On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] to discuss preventing the Democratic Party from losing in a landslide during the November elections.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&dat=19720804&printsec=frontpage|title=Carter, Wallace hold election conference|date=August 4, 1972|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune}}</ref>\n\nAfter McGovern's loss in November 1972, Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff. He had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the [[National Governors Association]] to boost his visibility. On [[David Rockefeller]]'s endorsement he was named to the [[Trilateral Commission]] in April 1973. The following year he was named chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns.<ref>Bourne, pp. 237\u2013250.</ref> In 1973 he appeared on the game show ''[[What's My Line]]'', where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation.

He used a two-prong strategy: in the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's [[George Wallace]], Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He had traveled over {{convert|50000|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}}, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/carter/player/#v276 |title=Jimmy Carter |series=The American Experience |publisher=Public Broadcasting System}}</ref> Initially dismissed as a regional candidate,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |authorlink1=David Broder |title=Early Evaluation Impossible on Presidential Candidates |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yMgwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LQIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7214%2C2087680|accessdate=January 3, 2016 |work=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=December 18, 1974 |page=16}}</ref> Carter proved to be the Democrat with the most effective national strategy, and he clinched the nomination.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Carter and Ford in a debate, September 23, 1976.jpg|thumb|Carter and President [[Gerald Ford]] debating at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n\nThe national news media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'':\n\n{{quote|What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media.

The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official [[Robert Gates]], \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\" thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"<ref name=\"Riedel\"/><ref name=\"Gates\">{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Bob |title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007 |isbn=9781416543367 |pp=145\u2013147 |language=en}} When asked whether he expected that the revelations in his memoir (combined with an apocryphal quote attributed to Brzezinski) would inspire \"a mind-bending number of conspiracy theories which adamantly\u2014and wrongly\u2014accuse the Carter Administration of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan,\" Gates replied: \"No, because there was no basis in fact for an allegation the administration tried to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan militarily.\" See Gates, email communication with John Bernell White Jr., October 15, 2011, as cited in {{cite thesis |last=White |first=John Bernell |url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |title=The Strategic Mind Of Zbigniew Brzezinski: How A Native Pole Used Afghanistan To Protect His Homeland |date=May 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |pp=45\u201346, 82 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022857/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |language=en}} cf. {{cite book |authorlink=Steve Coll |last=Coll |first=Steve |title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |year=2004 |isbn=9781594200076 |p=[https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll/page/581 581] |quote=Contemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail.&nbsp;...

U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, [[Ronald Reagan]], at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion.

I've signed a public letter calling for the Democratic Party at the next convention to espouse my position on abortion which is to minimize the need, requirement for abortion and limit it only to women whose life {{sic}} are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest.

This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: \"an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them.\" ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action \"the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=October 21, 2000 |title=Carter Sadly Turns Back On National Baptist Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment.
