Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as [[hunting]], [[crime]], [[law enforcement]], [[self-defense]], and [[war]]fare. In broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy target.\n\nWhile ordinary objects \u2013 sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles \u2013 can be used as weapons, many are expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[axe]]s and [[sword]]s, to complicated modern [[firearm]]s, [[tank]]s, [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, [[biological warfare|biological]] weapons, and [[cyberweapon]]s.

They were involved in mobile combat and [[sieges]] which involved various [[siege weapon]]s and tactics. Knights on horseback developed tactics for charging with [[lances]] providing an impact on the enemy formations and then drawing more practical weapons (such as [[sword]]s) once they entered into the melee. By contrast, infantry, in the age before structured formations, relied on cheap, sturdy weapons such as [[spear]]s and billhooks in close combat and [[Bow (weapon)|bows]] from a distance. As armies became more professional, their equipment was standardized and infantry transitioned to [[pike (weapon)|pikes]]. Pikes are normally seven to eight feet in length, and used in conjunction with smaller side-arms (short sword).\n\nIn Eastern and [[Middle Eastern]] warfare, similar tactics were developed independent of European influences.\n\nThe introduction of [[gunpowder]] from the Asia at the end of this period revolutionized warfare. Formations of [[musketeers]], protected by [[pikemen]] came to dominate open battles, and the [[cannon]] replaced the [[trebuchet]] as the dominant [[siege weapon]].\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\n==== Early modern ====\nThe European [[Renaissance]] marked the beginning of the implementation of firearms in western warfare. [[Gun]]s and [[rocket]]s were introduced to the battlefield.\n\n[[Firearm]]s are qualitatively different from earlier weapons because they release energy from combustible [[propellant]]s such as [[gunpowder]], rather than from a counter-weight or spring. This energy is released very rapidly and can be replicated without much effort by the user. Therefore even early firearms such as the [[arquebus]] were much more [[power (physics)|powerful]] than human-powered weapons. Firearms became increasingly important and effective during the 16th century to 19th century, with progressive improvements in [[Lock (firearm)|ignition mechanisms]] followed by revolutionary changes in [[ammunition]] handling and propellant. During the [[U.S. Civil War]] new applications of firearms including the [[machine gun]] and [[ironclad warship]] emerged that would still be recognizable and useful military weapons today, particularly in [[limited war|limited conflicts]]. In the 19th century [[warship]] propulsion changed from [[sail]] power to [[fossil fuel]]-powered [[steam engine]]s.\n\n[[File:Prussian bayonet clean.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[bayonet]] is used as both [[knife]] and, when attached to a rifle, a [[polearm]].]]\nSince the mid-18th century North American French-Indian war through the beginning of the 20th century, human-powered weapons were reduced from the primary weaponry of the battlefield yielding to gunpowder-based weaponry. Sometimes referred to as the \"Age of Rifles\",<ref>p. 263, Hind</ref> this period was characterized by the development of firearms for infantry and cannons for support, as well as the beginnings of mechanized weapons such as the [[machine gun]].\nOf particular note, [[Howitzer]]s were able to destroy masonry fortresses and other fortifications, and this single invention caused a [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA), establishing tactics and doctrine that are still in use today. ''See [[Technology during World War I]] for a detailed discussion.''\n\n==== Industrial age====\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25| The [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] was the successor to the [[Maxim gun]] and remained in British military service for 79 consecutive years.]]\n[[File:Cz805.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25| [[Assault rifle]] [[CZ-805 BREN]] (produced  in Czech Republic).]]\n\nAn important feature of [[industrial age]] warfare was [[technological escalation]] \u2013 innovations were rapidly matched through replication or countered by another innovation. The [[Technology during World War I|technological escalation during World War I]] (WW I) was profound, including the wide introduction of [[aircraft]] into [[Technology during World War I|warfare]], and naval warfare with the introduction of [[aircraft carrier]]s.\n\n====World War I====\n[[World War I]] marked the entry of fully industrialized warfare as well as [[weapons of mass destruction]] (''e.g.'', [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]), and new weapons were developed quickly to meet wartime needs. Above all, it promised to the military commanders the independence from the horse and the resurgence in [[maneuver warfare]] through extensive use of motor vehicles. The changes that these [[Military technology during World War II|military technologies]] underwent before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]] were evolutionary, but defined the development for the rest of the century.\n\n====Interwar====\nThis period of innovation in weapon design continued in the inter-war period (between WW I and [[technological escalation during World War II|WW II]]) with continuous evolution of weapon systems by all major industrial powers.  The major armament firms were the [[Schneider-Creusot]] (based in France), the [[\u0160koda Works]] (Czechoslovakia), and [[Vickers]] (Great Britain). The 1920s were committed to disarmament and outlawing of war and poison gas, but rearmament picked up rapidly in the 1930s. The munitions makers responded nimbly to the rapidly shifting strategic and economic landscape. The main purchasers of munitions from the big three companies were Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey-- and, to a lesser extent, in Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, and the Soviet Union,<ref>Jonathan A. Grant, ''Between Depression and Disarmament: The International Armaments Business, 1919-1939'' (Cambridge UP,  2018). [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=53757  Online review]</ref>\n\n=====Criminalizing poison gas=====\nRealistic critics understood that war could not really be outlawed, but its worst excesses might be banned. Poison gas became the focus of a worldwide crusade in the 1920s.  Poison gas did not win battles, and the generals did not want it. The soldiers hated it far more intensely than bullets or explosive shells. By 1918, chemical shells made up 35 per cent of French ammunition supplies, 25 per cent of British, and 20 per cent of the American stock. The \u201cProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous, or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\u201d [\"Geneva Protocol\"] was issued in 1925, and was accepted as policy by all major countries. In 1937 poison gas was manufactured in large quantities, but not used except against nations that lacked modern weapons or gas masks.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Eric Croddy|author2=James J.

''See [[military technology during World War II]] for a detailed discussion.''\n[[World War II]] however, perhaps marked the most frantic period of weapons development in the history of humanity. Massive numbers of new designs and concepts were fielded, and all existing technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945. The most powerful weapon invented during this period was the [[atomic bomb]], however many other weapons influenced the world, such as jet planes and radar, but were overshadowed by the visibility of nuclear weapons And long-range rockets.\n\n==== Nuclear weapons ====\n{{Main|Nuclear holocaust}}\nSince the realization of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD), the nuclear option of all-out war is no longer considered a survivable scenario.  During the [[Cold War]] in the  years following [[World War II]], both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a [[nuclear arms race]]. Each country and their allies continually attempted to out-develop each other in the field of nuclear armaments. Once the joint technological capabilities reached the point of being able to ensure the destruction of the Earth x100 fold, then a new tactic had to be developed.  With this realization, armaments development funding shifted back to primarily sponsoring the development of conventional arms technologies for support of [[limited war]]s rather than [[total war]].<ref name=\"NuclearDefunding\">{{cite journal |year=2004 |journal=The Ploughshares Monitor |volume=25 |issue=4 |author=Estabrooks, Sarah |url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/mond04f.htm |title=Funding for new nuclear weapons programs eliminated |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620191013/http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/monitor/mond04f.htm |archivedate=June 20, 2007}} Report on congressional refusal to fund additional nuclear weapons research.There was a guy named Henry Bond he was around 74 years old</ref>\n\n==== Post Cold War ====\nDuring the late 2010s, tensions between the West and the East escalate as nuclear-based issues arise.

It consists of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[industry]] involved in the [[research and development]], [[engineering]], production, and servicing of [[military]] material, equipment, and facilities. Many [[industrialized countries]] have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces - and some also have a substantial trade in weapons for use by its citizens, for self-defence, hunting or sporting purposes. \n\nContracts to supply a given country's military are awarded by governments, making arms contracts of substantial political importance. The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development a \"[[military-industrial complex]]\", where the armed forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked.\n\nAccording to research institute SIPRI, the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010\u201314 was 16 percent higher than in 2005\u20132009<ref>[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2018/global-arms-industry-us-companies-dominate-top-100-russian-arms-industry-moves-second-place Global Arms Industry: US Companies Dominate Top 100 Arm Industry] SIPRI.

They were involved in mobile combat and [[sieges]] which involved various [[siege weapon]]s and tactics. Knights on horseback developed tactics for charging with [[lances]] providing an impact on the enemy formations and then drawing more practical weapons (such as [[sword]]s) once they entered into the melee. By contrast, infantry, in the age before structured formations, relied on cheap, sturdy weapons such as [[spear]]s and billhooks in close combat and [[Bow (weapon)|bows]] from a distance. As armies became more professional, their equipment was standardized and infantry transitioned to [[pike (weapon)|pikes]]. Pikes are normally seven to eight feet in length, and used in conjunction with smaller side-arms (short sword).\n\nIn Eastern and [[Middle Eastern]] warfare, similar tactics were developed independent of European influences.\n\nThe introduction of [[gunpowder]] from the Asia at the end of this period revolutionized warfare. Formations of [[musketeers]], protected by [[pikemen]] came to dominate open battles, and the [[cannon]] replaced the [[trebuchet]] as the dominant [[siege weapon]].\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\n==== Early modern ====\nThe European [[Renaissance]] marked the beginning of the implementation of firearms in western warfare. [[Gun]]s and [[rocket]]s were introduced to the battlefield.\n\n[[Firearm]]s are qualitatively different from earlier weapons because they release energy from combustible [[propellant]]s such as [[gunpowder]], rather than from a counter-weight or spring. This energy is released very rapidly and can be replicated without much effort by the user. Therefore even early firearms such as the [[arquebus]] were much more [[power (physics)|powerful]] than human-powered weapons. Firearms became increasingly important and effective during the 16th century to 19th century, with progressive improvements in [[Lock (firearm)|ignition mechanisms]] followed by revolutionary changes in [[ammunition]] handling and propellant. During the [[U.S. Civil War]] new applications of firearms including the [[machine gun]] and [[ironclad warship]] emerged that would still be recognizable and useful military weapons today, particularly in [[limited war|limited conflicts]]. In the 19th century [[warship]] propulsion changed from [[sail]] power to [[fossil fuel]]-powered [[steam engine]]s.\n\n[[File:Prussian bayonet clean.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[bayonet]] is used as both [[knife]] and, when attached to a rifle, a [[polearm]].]]\nSince the mid-18th century North American French-Indian war through the beginning of the 20th century, human-powered weapons were reduced from the primary weaponry of the battlefield yielding to gunpowder-based weaponry. Sometimes referred to as the \"Age of Rifles\",<ref>p. 263, Hind</ref> this period was characterized by the development of firearms for infantry and cannons for support, as well as the beginnings of mechanized weapons such as the [[machine gun]].\nOf particular note, [[Howitzer]]s were able to destroy masonry fortresses and other fortifications, and this single invention caused a [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA), establishing tactics and doctrine that are still in use today. ''See [[Technology during World War I]] for a detailed discussion.''\n\n==== Industrial age====\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25| The [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] was the successor to the [[Maxim gun]] and remained in British military service for 79 consecutive years.]]\n[[File:Cz805.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25| [[Assault rifle]] [[CZ-805 BREN]] (produced  in Czech Republic).]]\n\nAn important feature of [[industrial age]] warfare was [[technological escalation]] \u2013 innovations were rapidly matched through replication or countered by another innovation. The [[Technology during World War I|technological escalation during World War I]] (WW I) was profound, including the wide introduction of [[aircraft]] into [[Technology during World War I|warfare]], and naval warfare with the introduction of [[aircraft carrier]]s.\n\n====World War I====\n[[World War I]] marked the entry of fully industrialized warfare as well as [[weapons of mass destruction]] (''e.g.'', [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]), and new weapons were developed quickly to meet wartime needs. Above all, it promised to the military commanders the independence from the horse and the resurgence in [[maneuver warfare]] through extensive use of motor vehicles. The changes that these [[Military technology during World War II|military technologies]] underwent before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]] were evolutionary, but defined the development for the rest of the century.\n\n====Interwar====\nThis period of innovation in weapon design continued in the inter-war period (between WW I and [[technological escalation during World War II|WW II]]) with continuous evolution of weapon systems by all major industrial powers.  The major armament firms were the [[Schneider-Creusot]] (based in France), the [[\u0160koda Works]] (Czechoslovakia), and [[Vickers]] (Great Britain). The 1920s were committed to disarmament and outlawing of war and poison gas, but rearmament picked up rapidly in the 1930s. The munitions makers responded nimbly to the rapidly shifting strategic and economic landscape. The main purchasers of munitions from the big three companies were Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey-- and, to a lesser extent, in Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, and the Soviet Union,<ref>Jonathan A. Grant, ''Between Depression and Disarmament: The International Armaments Business, 1919-1939'' (Cambridge UP,  2018). [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=53757  Online review]</ref>\n\n=====Criminalizing poison gas=====\nRealistic critics understood that war could not really be outlawed, but its worst excesses might be banned. Poison gas became the focus of a worldwide crusade in the 1920s.  Poison gas did not win battles, and the generals did not want it. The soldiers hated it far more intensely than bullets or explosive shells. By 1918, chemical shells made up 35 per cent of French ammunition supplies, 25 per cent of British, and 20 per cent of the American stock. The \u201cProtocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous, or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\u201d [\"Geneva Protocol\"] was issued in 1925, and was accepted as policy by all major countries. In 1937 poison gas was manufactured in large quantities, but not used except against nations that lacked modern weapons or gas masks.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Eric Croddy|author2=James J.

''See [[military technology during World War II]] for a detailed discussion.''\n[[World War II]] however, perhaps marked the most frantic period of weapons development in the history of humanity. Massive numbers of new designs and concepts were fielded, and all existing technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945. The most powerful weapon invented during this period was the [[atomic bomb]], however many other weapons influenced the world, such as jet planes and radar, but were overshadowed by the visibility of nuclear weapons And long-range rockets.\n\n==== Nuclear weapons ====\n{{Main|Nuclear holocaust}}\nSince the realization of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD), the nuclear option of all-out war is no longer considered a survivable scenario.  During the [[Cold War]] in the  years following [[World War II]], both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a [[nuclear arms race]]. Each country and their allies continually attempted to out-develop each other in the field of nuclear armaments. Once the joint technological capabilities reached the point of being able to ensure the destruction of the Earth x100 fold, then a new tactic had to be developed.

It consists of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[industry]] involved in the [[research and development]], [[engineering]], production, and servicing of [[military]] material, equipment, and facilities. Many [[industrialized countries]] have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces - and some also have a substantial trade in weapons for use by its citizens, for self-defence, hunting or sporting purposes. \n\nContracts to supply a given country's military are awarded by governments, making arms contracts of substantial political importance. The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development a \"[[military-industrial complex]]\", where the armed forces, commerce, and politics become closely linked.\n\nAccording to research institute SIPRI, the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010\u201314 was 16 percent higher than in 2005\u20132009<ref>[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2018/global-arms-industry-us-companies-dominate-top-100-russian-arms-industry-moves-second-place Global Arms Industry: US Companies Dominate Top 100 Arm Industry] SIPRI.

This may be at a [[local government|local]] or [[central government]] level, or international treaty. Examples of such controls include:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* The [[right of self-defense]]\n* [[Knife legislation]]\n* [[Air gun laws]]\n* [[Gun law]]\n* [[Arms trafficking]] laws\n* [[Arms control]] treaties\n* [[Space Preservation Treaty]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gun laws===\n{{main|Gun laws}}\nAll countries have laws and policies regulating aspects such as the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification and use of small arms by civilians.\n\nCountries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a license for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for hunting, sport shooting (a.k.a. target shooting), self-defense, collecting, and concealed carry, with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\n\n===Arms control laws===\n{{Main|Arms control}}\nInternational treaties and agreements place restrictions upon the development, production, stockpiling, proliferation and usage of weapons from [[small arms]] and [[Artillery|heavy weapons]] to [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Arms control is typically exercised through the use of diplomacy which seeks to impose such limitations upon consenting participants, although it may also comprise efforts by a nation or group of nations to enforce limitations upon a non-consenting country.\n\n===Arms trafficking laws===\n{{expand section|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|Arms trafficking}}\nArms trafficking is the trafficking of contraband weapons and [[ammunition]]. What constitutes legal trade in firearms varies widely, depending on local and national laws.\n\n== Lifecycle problems ==\nThere are a number of issue around the potential ongoing risks from deployed weapons, the safe storage of weapons, and their eventual disposal when no longer effective or safe.\n* [[Ocean dumping]] of unused weapons and bombs, including ordinary bombs, [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]], landmines and chemical weapons has been common practice by many nations, and often caused hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Ian |title=Chemical Weapon Munitions Dumped at Sea: An Interactive Map |url=http://www.nonproliferation.org/chemical-weapon-munitions-dumped-at-sea/ |publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |accessdate=19 August 2017|date=August 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Curry |first1=Andrew |title=Chemical Weapons Dumped in the Ocean After World War II Could Threaten Waters Worldwide |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/decaying-weapons-world-war-II-threaten-waters-worldwide-180961046/ |publisher=SMITHSONIAN.COM |accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=me>{{cite news |title=Military Ordinance [sic] Dumped in Gulf of Mexico |url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/military-ordinance-dumped-in-gulf-of-mexico |accessdate=4 August 2015 |work=Maritime Executive |date=August 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name=wbgh>{{cite news |author1=Edgar B.

In some cases, weapons first introduced in science fiction have now been made a reality.{{ref}} Other science fiction weapons remain purely fictional, and are often beyond the realms of known physical possibility.\n\nAt its most prosaic, science fiction features an endless variety of [[Sidearm (weapon)|sidearm]]s, mostly variations on real weapons such as [[gun]]s and [[sword]]s. Among the best-known of these are the [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Phasers|phaser]] used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series, films and novels and the [[lightsaber]] and [[List of Star Wars weapons#Personal ranged|blaster]] featured in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, comics, novels and TV series.\n\nIn addition to adding action and entertainment value, weaponry in science fiction sometimes become themes when they touch on deeper concerns, often motivated by contemporary issues.

{"title_page": "Cradle of Erotica", "text_new": "'''The Cradle of Erotica: A Study of Afro-Asian Sexual Expression and an Analysis of Erotic Freedom in Social Relationships''', more easily identified as '''The Cradle of Erotica''', is a supposed research novel written by [[Allen Edwardes]] and R.E.L. Masters. Published in 1970, the book explores the sexual practices and rituals of various ethnic groups from India, Africa, and South-East Asia.\n \nEdwardes authored multiple novels that claimed to explore [[eroticism]] and sexuality outside of Western culture.<ref>Roland Boer, Orientalist Camp: The Case of Allen Edwardes (Australia: University of Newcastle Press, 2012), 133</ref> Edwardes\u2019 ''Erotica Judaica'' investigates the sexual history of the [[Jews]]. Edwardes\u2019 also penned ''The Jewel in the Lotus: A historical survey of the sexual culture in the East'', a novel that analyzes peculiar sexual behaviors of Asian [[ethnographies]]. \n\n R.E.L Masters is a close confidant of Edwardes. Masters's novels focused on human conscientious and potential.<ref>Robert Masters, husband of Jean Houston, has passed away. July 30, 2008</ref> Together these two authors crafted The ''Cradle of Erotica'' to supposedly examine and access sexual activities of Afro-Asian cultures.\n\n==Summary==\n===Philosophy===\nEdwardes and Masters begin this chapter by explaining the importance of [[copulation]] in both the [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] faiths. The Turkish writer Khojeh \u2019Omar Halebi Abbbu \u2018Othman, author of the ''Book of the Secrets Laws of Love'', details how [[Allah]] and [[Eros]], Greek for intimate love, are one of the same divine law . This divine attraction between man and woman is mirrored in [[Hindu]] belief. \n\nWang Shih-cheng explains how this attraction is as natural as the Earth and one cannot blame this attraction on evil.<ref>Allen Edwardes & R.E.L Masters, The Cradle of Erotica: A Study of Afro-Asian Sexual Expression and an Analysis of Erotic Freedom in Social Relationships (London: The Odyssey Press, 1970),1</ref> Edwardes and Masters then address and explain the [[matriarchal]] dominance of sex in Afro-Asian sexual practices, especially those relationships seen in the Muslim faith. Conservative Muslims believe the liberation of women from their natural position of subservience in Muslim culture is a pathway to indulgencing in lustful sex without shame. Differing from the intimate love synonymous with Allah, lustful sex is strictly for physical enjoyment, while intimate sex is a connection in both spirit and body.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica. 11-14</ref> \n\nThis chapter then goes on to describe the allegedly lascivious natures of [[Hinduism]] and the Chinese. This supposedly endless thirst for sexual activity in Oriental ethos is compared to various animals.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica 9-12</ref> This chapter introduces belief systems that widely differ from those of Western sexuality and this trend is carried throughout the other chapters of this book.\n\n===Genitalia===\nThis chapter is almost exclusively dedicated to the various sizes and measurements of [[the]] genitals of Afro-Asian peoples. Comparisons between humans and animals are common throughout this chapter. Addressing the [[vagina]], the authors claim that each ethnic and or religious group has their own opinion of the variations of the vagina.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,27-28</ref> The [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[clitoris]] in certain ethnicities renders place names that distinguish them from their other Afro-Asian cousins.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 32-34</ref> This variation is not seen with the descriptions and measurements of the various penises of Afro-Asian men. In fact, Edwardes and Masters cite [[Sir Richard Burton]]'s and Dr. Jacobus observations and measurements as solid facts in regards to the [[penises]] of various ethnicities.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,29-31</ref> This chapter also explores specific parts of the penis, such as the [[glans]] and its coloration, as further means of distinction between the ethnicities of Afro-Asian.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,43</ref>\n\n===Genital intercourse===\nThis chapter states how many Afro-Asian cultures refer to [[copulation]] as an art. The descriptions and analysis of various sexual techniques, practiced by men and or women, comprises the core material of this chapter. The authors claim that Coitus prolongatus, the process of delaying the [[ejaculation]] of a male in order to accelerate the [[female orgasm]], is a sexual technique practiced by Muslim and Hindu men.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 47-48</ref> Themes of [[sadomasochism]] and violence are examined in Islamic, Hindu, and Egyptian sexual folklore. \n\nIn Egypt, the title of abu \u0305 hhimla \u0305t, which translates to father of assaults, is a label of pride, boasting of a man's voracious lovemaking.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,55-57</ref> [[Aphrodisiacs]] are also mentioned in detail throughout this chapter. The authors claim that [[opium]] and [[marijuana]], specifically [[hashish]], are used by many Afro-Asian cultures in order to enhance their sexual experiences. Opium is used to excite the imagination and dull the senses, while hashish is used to desensitize and prolong the [[erection]] of a penis.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,61-63</ref> The authors claim that a female under the influence of hashish had the purported ability to have consecutive vaginal and [[anal sex]] with over one hundred men .\n\n=== Promiscuity ===\nThis chapter examines the institution of [[marriage]] in Afro-Asian culture. The authors describe men of ease as Arabian men who profit from the [[sexual exploitation]] of their wives, sisters, daughters, or any other female relative. Their female counterparts, loose women, are wives that participate in [[prostitution]]. Edwardes and Masters quote the French army surgeon Dr. Jacobus, who calculaste that over 80% of Arabian married couples are involved in [[adultery]]. North African Arabian women have reported that they have engaged in sex with more than one man at one time. This act not only conflicts with the Western belief of a [[monogamous]] sexual partner, but questions the Western philosophy of two men having sex with the same female as [[homosexual]]. This thought is cemented with evidence of Arabian and Egyptian dancers having gaping vaginal orifices. This lust for [[polyandry]] is also evident in Arabian women engaging in copulation with several males at once in erotic parlor games.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 88-89</ref>\n\n===Anal intercourse===\nThis chapter explores anal intercourse in Afro-Asian sexual culture. The chapter starts with the biological explanation of why a man would be drawn to the anus. The [[Anal sphincter muscles (disambiguation)|anal sphincter]] contains a greater contractile power than the vagina, and this allows the male greater pleasure through increased friction.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 104</ref> The chapter continues to clain that anal intercourse is a routine practice among many Muslim women. The authors claim that [[Indonesians|Indonesian]] and [[Malayans|Malayan]] people also routinely practice [[sodomy]]. Chinese Muslims and [[Buddhists]] are also notorious for using their servant boys as means of sexual release.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 114-115</ref>\n\n===Masturbation===\nEdwardes and Masters attribute the prevalence of [[masturbation]] in Afro-Asian societies to the sleeping and living patterns of children. Two or more young boys often share a room, even a bed in some cases, which often leads to genital play. Patterns of behavior are then formed. In the East, young boys follow a regular pattern of manual and oral stimulation. Those boys who refuse this genital play are rejected and labeled as sexless [[hermaphrodites]].<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,119</ref> Jewish and Muslim boys also engage in this social masturbation. Masturbation is not explicit to young boys. Allegedly, North African Jewish girls perform acts of masturbation with their male relatives. The male relative often reciprocates the act. Sadomasochist themes, which were mentioned in the Genital Intercourse chapter, are also evident in feminine masturbation. [[Female masturbation]] is seen as an outlet for girls\u2019 frustration and aggressiveness.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 138-139</ref>\n\n===Oral intercourse===\nEdwardes and Masters label early Egyptians as the first peoples to commercialize [[fellatio]]. Egyptian women would apply lipstick to their lips in order to mimic the appearance of the [[vulva]]. [[Cleopatra]], who wore lipstick herself, was said to have performed fellatio on over 1,000 men.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 153</ref> The rest of the chapter investigates specific examples of fellatio in Afro-Asian cultures. Certain [[brothels]] in Northern and Eastern Africa are specialized in the art of qerdz, or sucking. Arabian, Indian, and African women have all supposedly been found to be employed at these brothels.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 155</ref> When their husbands are away from work, Sa\u2019udi Arabia women are mentioned as performing fellatio to random males. Men living in [[Mecca]] create [[concubines]] of women in order to fulfill their sexual hunger, specifically [[cunnilingus]].<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 156-158</ref> Fellatio is also witnessed between men and their boy servants.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 162-163</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n===Orientalism===\nAllen Edwardes and R.E.L Masters have been accused of [[orientalism]]. Orientalism is the patronizing, and often racist, Western thought surrounding the beliefs and practices of cultures located in India, Eastern Asia, or the Middle East.\n\nJoseph Boone uses orientalism as his weapon of demystification against Edwardes and Masters fictional portrayal of Eastern sexuality.<ref>Joseph A. Boone, Vacation Cruises; Or, the Homoerotics of Orientalism (New York: Modern Language Association, 1995), 90</ref> Boone states that homosexuality is recognized and glorified in Eastern sexuality in order to make Western, white, civilization more pure and civilized. He uses the obsession with the penis sizes of Egyptians and Arabian men in The Cradle of Erotica as his perfect example of the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. Through a complicated method of execution, Edwardes and Masters use exotic Eastern sexuality as a platform of expressing Western homosexual thought, without sacrificing any supposed [[Homology (psychology)|homologous]] sexual belief that is supposedly shared among all Western people.<ref>Boone, Vacation Cruises; Or, the Homoerotics of Orientalism, 94.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Sexuality in novels]]\n", "text_old": "'''The Cradle of Erotica: A Study of Afro-Asian Sexual Expression and an Analysis of Erotic Freedom in Social Relationships''', more easily identified as '''The Cradle of Erotica''', is a supposed research novel written by [[Allen Edwardes]] and R.E.L.

The authors claim that Coitus prolongatus, the process of delaying the [[ejaculation]] of a male in order to accelerate the [[female orgasm]], is a sexual technique practiced by Muslim and Hindu men.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 47-48</ref> Themes of [[sadomasochism]] and violence are examined in Islamic, Hindu, and Egyptian sexual folklore. \n\nIn Egypt, the title of abu \u0305 hhimla \u0305t, which translates to father of assaults, is a label of pride, boasting of a man's voracious lovemaking.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,55-57</ref> [[Aphrodisiacs]] are also mentioned in detail throughout this chapter. The authors claim that [[opium]] and [[marijuana]], specifically [[hashish]], are used by many Afro-Asian cultures in order to enhance their sexual experiences. Opium is used to excite the imagination and dull the senses, while hashish is used to desensitize and prolong the [[erection]] of a penis.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,61-63</ref> The authors claim that a female under the influence of hashish had the purported ability to have consecutive vaginal and [[anal sex]] with over one hundred men .\n\n=== Promiscuity ===\nThis chapter examines the institution of [[marriage]] in Afro-Asian culture. The authors describe men of ease as Arabian men who profit from the [[sexual exploitation]] of their wives, sisters, daughters, or any other female relative. Their female counterparts, loose women, are wives that participate in [[prostitution]]. Edwardes and Masters quote the French army surgeon Dr. Jacobus, who calculaste that over 80% of Arabian married couples are involved in [[adultery]]. North African Arabian women have reported that they have engaged in sex with more than one man at one time. This act not only conflicts with the Western belief of a [[monogamous]] sexual partner, but questions the Western philosophy of two men having sex with the same female as [[homosexual]]. This thought is cemented with evidence of Arabian and Egyptian dancers having gaping vaginal orifices. This lust for [[polyandry]] is also evident in Arabian women engaging in copulation with several males at once in erotic parlor games.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 88-89</ref>\n\n===Anal intercourse===\nThis chapter explores anal intercourse in Afro-Asian sexual culture. The chapter starts with the biological explanation of why a man would be drawn to the anus. The [[Anal sphincter muscles (disambiguation)|anal sphincter]] contains a greater contractile power than the vagina, and this allows the male greater pleasure through increased friction.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 104</ref> The chapter continues to clain that anal intercourse is a routine practice among many Muslim women. The authors claim that [[Indonesians|Indonesian]] and [[Malayans|Malayan]] people also routinely practice [[sodomy]]. Chinese Muslims and [[Buddhists]] are also notorious for using their servant boys as means of sexual release.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 114-115</ref>\n\n===Masturbation===\nEdwardes and Masters attribute the prevalence of [[masturbation]] in Afro-Asian societies to the sleeping and living patterns of children. Two or more young boys often share a room, even a bed in some cases, which often leads to genital play. Patterns of behavior are then formed. In the East, young boys follow a regular pattern of manual and oral stimulation. Those boys who refuse this genital play are rejected and labeled as sexless [[hermaphrodites]].<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica,119</ref> Jewish and Muslim boys also engage in this social masturbation. Masturbation is not explicit to young boys. Allegedly, North African Jewish girls perform acts of masturbation with their male relatives. The male relative often reciprocates the act. Sadomasochist themes, which were mentioned in the Genital Intercourse chapter, are also evident in feminine masturbation. [[Female masturbation]] is seen as an outlet for girls\u2019 frustration and aggressiveness.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 138-139</ref>\n\n===Oral intercourse===\nEdwardes and Masters label early Egyptians as the first peoples to commercialize [[fellatio]]. Egyptian women would apply lipstick to their lips in order to mimic the appearance of the [[vulva]]. [[Cleopatra]], who wore lipstick herself, was said to have performed fellatio on over 1,000 men.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 153</ref> The rest of the chapter investigates specific examples of fellatio in Afro-Asian cultures. Certain [[brothels]] in Northern and Eastern Africa are specialized in the art of qerdz, or sucking. Arabian, Indian, and African women have all supposedly been found to be employed at these brothels.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 155</ref> When their husbands are away from work, Sa\u2019udi Arabia women are mentioned as performing fellatio to random males. Men living in [[Mecca]] create [[concubines]] of women in order to fulfill their sexual hunger, specifically [[cunnilingus]].<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 156-158</ref> Fellatio is also witnessed between men and their boy servants.<ref>Edwardes & Masters, The Cradle of Erotica, 162-163</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n===Orientalism===\nAllen Edwardes and R.E.L Masters have been accused of [[orientalism]]. Orientalism is the patronizing, and often racist, Western thought surrounding the beliefs and practices of cultures located in India, Eastern Asia, or the Middle East.\n\nJoseph Boone uses orientalism as his weapon of demystification against Edwardes and Masters fictional portrayal of Eastern sexuality.<ref>Joseph A. Boone, Vacation Cruises; Or, the Homoerotics of Orientalism (New York: Modern Language Association, 1995), 90</ref> Boone states that homosexuality is recognized and glorified in Eastern sexuality in order to make Western, white, civilization more pure and civilized. He uses the obsession with the penis sizes of Egyptians and Arabian men in The Cradle of Erotica as his perfect example of the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. Through a complicated method of execution, Edwardes and Masters use exotic Eastern sexuality as a platform of expressing Western homosexual thought, without sacrificing any supposed [[Homology (psychology)|homologous]] sexual belief that is supposedly shared among all Western people.<ref>Boone, Vacation Cruises; Or, the Homoerotics of Orientalism, 94.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Sexuality in novels]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_Erotica"}

Stan is upset that he has to go and becomes even more angered when he is locked in a room with nerdy \"Melvin\" classmates that he does not like: [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Pip Pirrup|Pip]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Dougie (South Park)|Dougie]]. After finding a box of women's clothing the three insist on playing ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', and an unenthusiastic Stan uses the game to find a way out of the basement to an upstairs bedroom where there are cookies and TV. Meanwhile, at the party, Mr. Mackey gives [[Gerald and Shiela Broflovski|the Broflovskis]] and [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Marshes]] a tour of his home and leads them out to the [[hot tub]]. The wives leave Randy and Gerald outside in the hot tub, who declare the present evening to be a night of experimenting. The two talk about [[threesomes]] and decide to [[masturbate]] in front of one another. This leads to awkwardness after Randy questions his sexuality.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] thinks that the party inside is a [[mass suicide|suicide cult]], and that they plan to kill themselves at the start of the meteor shower. Determined to prevent this, they set up a blockade and prepare to open fire on the cult if they do not desist; at one point, a couple of party-goers leave and are immediately fatally shot at (due to the ATF believing they had weapons despite them clearly not having any). The Newsman recalls that the last time the ATF did this was at the [[Waco siege]] where they ended up killing innocent people for false accusation, but the ATF dismisses him. All the while, the party-goers (who progressively become drunk) inside are unaware of their presence. Stan and the kids discover what is happening and try to speak to the ATF, but are shot at and forced to flee back inside. The kids record a [[video tape]] showing that the party inside is not a cult to the Newsman; the ATF realizes their mistake, claiming it was a \"test simulation\" and quickly disperse after their secret weapon, a large rocket called \"The Negotiator\", fires and destroys every home in the neighborhood except for Mackey's. \n\nInside, Randy is extremely uncomfortable being around Gerald, who is concerned about Randy's behavior. When Randy finally admits to the entire party that he and Gerald engaged in group masturbation, he is relieved upon discovering that he's not the only one to have masturbated in front of a person of the same sex. Outside, the boys rejoice their triumph of saving the day and Stan realizes that the others are just normal kids like him.

He spent time on loan at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], before making a permanent move to former loan club [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] in 2012.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Scunthorpe United===\nBorn in [[Derby]], [[Derbyshire]], Lillis worked his way through [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]'s youth system, and made his d\u00e9but as a professional at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 22 December 2006. He spent most of his time at the Iron as the understudy of [[Joe Murphy (footballer born 1981)|Joe Murphy]], but has improved under the coaching of former [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] stalwart [[Kevin Pressman]].\n\nIn January 2009, Lillis went to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on a one-month loan in order to experience more first team action. He made his d\u00e9but in 2\u20132 draw with [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] on 20 January 2009. His first clean sheet for the Magpies came on 14 February where Notts County beat [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] 2\u20130. He returned to Scunthorpe making 5 appearances and 1 clean sheet.\n\nOn 1 September 2009, he signed for [[Grimsby Town]] on loan as cover for injured [[Nick Colgan]]. He made his d\u00e9but on 5 September 2009 against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], in a 4\u20130 defeat. He made four appearance before returning to the Iron.

Many of those trails became the basis of the first roads in the area, such as Natural Bridge and the historic [[St. Charles Rock Road]], which date back to the days of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]], and early [[United States|American]] settlement. The intersection of [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I-70]] and [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|I-270]] in this area add to air and rail access to make the area a good base for transportation-dependent industries. The recreational [[American Discovery Trail]] passes through the area.<ref>[https://discoverytrail.org/states/utah/ut-trail/ American Discovery Trail]</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|15.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|14.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nBridgeton has a long and uneven history. The first [[European ethnic groups|European]]s to interact with Native American peoples and settle there were associated with the area's days as part of the French [[Illinois Territory]]. The [[French people|French]] explorer, [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont|\u00c9tienne de Veniard de Bourgmont]] traveled the area in 1724, on a trail that developed as the main route between St. Louis and St. Charles.\n\nThe [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish gained colonial control]] in 1768 after France was defeated by Great Britain in the [[Seven Years' War]] and ceded its territory west of the Mississippi to Spain; they remained in control until 1804, when the area was transferred to the Americans in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In a 1799 census, the population of \"Marais des Liards\" was given as 337&nbsp;whites and 42&nbsp;slaves.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsp&fileName=037/llsp037.db&Page=383 Digest of the Laws of Louisiana, Appendix 4] from the [[American Memory]] archives of the [[Library of Congress]]</ref>\n\nBridgeton was first [[plat]]ted in 1794, and named ''Marais des Liards'' ([[Populus sect. Aegiros|Cottonwood]] [[Swamp]]). It was also known as ''Village \u00e0 Robert'', named after [[Robert Owen]], its founder, who had received a land grant from the Spanish government. In a Spanish census two years later it had a population (including [[slavery|slaves]]) of 77 males and 47 females.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} As the area received more and more [[English language|English]]-speaking settlers, the village's name became Owen's Station.\n\nBecause of its location, including its proximity to a [[ferry]] across the [[Missouri River]], Bridgeton became a stop along the way from St. Louis to St. Charles. [[Meriwether Lewis]] passed through on his way to meet members who were gathering as part of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. The city was granted a state [[charter]] in 1843; throughout the next few years it was a stop along the way for emigrants seeking the major trailheads to the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] and [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] trails.\n\nThe [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], a Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, came to Bridgeton from [[St. Stanislaus Seminary]] and [[St. Ferdinand Parish]] of [[Florissant, Missouri]].  The order established [[St. Mary's Parish, Bridgeton, Missouri|St. Mary's Church]] in 1851 as a [[Mission (station)|mission]] to serve area Catholics; it became a full parish within its first year. The [[Archdiocese of St. Louis]] suppressed the parish in 2001 due to the expansion of [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]], which caused a decline in residential population.\n\n===Modern history===\nBy 1950, Bridgeton's population was 276, lower than it had been in the late 1790s and early 19th century. The city expanded in size during the decade, growing through [[annexation]], to {{convert|16|sqmi|km2}}. The decade included the founding of the Northwest Chamber of Commerce,<ref>[http://www.northwestchamber.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=65&Itemid=86 About Us] from the Northwest Chamber of Commerce website</ref> the [[chamber of commerce]] for the [[Northwest St. Louis]] area, which includes Bridgeton.<ref>[http://www.northwestchamber.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=109&Itemid=76 Community Home] from the Northwest Chamber of Commerce website</ref>\n\nThis led into its period of greatest residential growth, the 1960s, during which nearly 8000 single-family homes were built. Denser development was strong during that decade as well, at nearly 2000 units. Unlike with single-family development, the multi-family development continued at about the same average pace during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nWhile residential construction nearly ended in the 1990s, that decade has seen significant growth in commercial development. [[Levee]]-protected [[floodplain]]s of the river, together with good access to interstate highways, rail, and the airport have translated into continued growth for Bridgeton and nearby communities, and a diversification of the city's tax base.

Many of those trails became the basis of the first roads in the area, such as Natural Bridge and the historic [[St. Charles Rock Road]], which date back to the days of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]], and early [[United States|American]] settlement. The intersection of [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I-70]] and [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|I-270]] in this area add to air and rail access to make the area a good base for transportation-dependent industries.

The first [[European ethnic groups|European]]s to interact with Native American peoples and settle there were associated with the area's days as part of the French [[Illinois Territory]]. The [[French people|French]] explorer, [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont|\u00c9tienne de Veniard de Bourgmont]] traveled the area in 1724, on a trail that developed as the main route between St. Louis and St. Charles.\n\nThe [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish gained colonial control]] in 1768 after France was defeated by Great Britain in the [[Seven Years' War]] and ceded its territory west of the Mississippi to Spain; they remained in control until 1804, when the area was transferred to the Americans in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In a 1799 census, the population of \"Marais des Liards\" was given as 337&nbsp;whites and 42&nbsp;slaves.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsp&fileName=037/llsp037.db&Page=383 Digest of the Laws of Louisiana, Appendix 4] from the [[American Memory]] archives of the [[Library of Congress]]</ref>\n\nBridgeton was first [[plat]]ted in 1794, and named ''Marais des Liards'' ([[Populus sect. Aegiros|Cottonwood]] [[Swamp]]). It was also known as ''Village \u00e0 Robert'', named after [[Robert Owen]], its founder, who had received a land grant from the Spanish government. In a Spanish census two years later it had a population (including [[slavery|slaves]]) of 77 males and 47 females.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} As the area received more and more [[English language|English]]-speaking settlers, the village's name became Owen's Station.\n\nBecause of its location, including its proximity to a [[ferry]] across the [[Missouri River]], Bridgeton became a stop along the way from St. Louis to St. Charles. [[Meriwether Lewis]] passed through on his way to meet members who were gathering as part of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. The city was granted a state [[charter]] in 1843; throughout the next few years it was a stop along the way for emigrants seeking the major trailheads to the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] and [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] trails.\n\nThe [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], a Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, came to Bridgeton from [[St. Stanislaus Seminary]] and [[St. Ferdinand Parish]] of [[Florissant, Missouri]].  The order established [[St. Mary's Parish, Bridgeton, Missouri|St. Mary's Church]] in 1851 as a [[Mission (station)|mission]] to serve area Catholics; it became a full parish within its first year. The [[Archdiocese of St. Louis]] suppressed the parish in 2001 due to the expansion of [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]], which caused a decline in residential population.\n\n===Modern history===\nBy 1950, Bridgeton's population was 276, lower than it had been in the late 1790s and early 19th century. The city expanded in size during the decade, growing through [[annexation]], to {{convert|16|sqmi|km2}}. The decade included the founding of the Northwest Chamber of Commerce,<ref>[http://www.northwestchamber.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=65&Itemid=86 About Us] from the Northwest Chamber of Commerce website</ref> the [[chamber of commerce]] for the [[Northwest St. Louis]] area, which includes Bridgeton.<ref>[http://www.northwestchamber.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=109&Itemid=76 Community Home] from the Northwest Chamber of Commerce website</ref>\n\nThis led into its period of greatest residential growth, the 1960s, during which nearly 8000 single-family homes were built. Denser development was strong during that decade as well, at nearly 2000 units. Unlike with single-family development, the multi-family development continued at about the same average pace during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nWhile residential construction nearly ended in the 1990s, that decade has seen significant growth in commercial development. [[Levee]]-protected [[floodplain]]s of the river, together with good access to interstate highways, rail, and the airport have translated into continued growth for Bridgeton and nearby communities, and a diversification of the city's tax base.  Proximity to [[Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport]] proved to be a mixed blessing. Starting in 1995, an expansion plan for the airport,<ref>{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> centered on a new runway plan called W-1W, was fought (unsuccessfully) by the city.
