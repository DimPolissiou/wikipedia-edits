The system detects pairs of [[gamma ray]]s emitted indirectly by a [[positron]]-emitting [[radioligand]], most commonly [[fluorine-18]], which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule called a [[radioactive tracer]]. Different ligands are used for different imaging purposes, depending on what the radiologist/researcher wants to detect. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern [[PET-CT|PET computed tomography]] scanners, three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a [[CT scan|computed tomography X-ray scan]] performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. \n\nIf the biologically active tracer molecule chosen for PET is [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), an [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[glucose]], the concentrations of tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of [[cancer]] [[metastasis]] (i.e., spreading to other sites) is the most common type of PET scan in standard medical care (representing 90% of current scans). [[Metabolic trapping]] of the radioactive glucose molecule allows the PET scan to be utilized.<ref>Miele, E.; Spinelli, G.

Less often, other [[radioactive tracers]], usually but not always labeled with [[fluorine-18]], are used to image the tissue concentration of other types of molecules of interest.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of PET scanners is their operating cost.<ref name=\"Carlson 151\">{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Neil | title = Physiology of Behavior | publisher = Pearson | series = Methods and Strategies of Research | volume = 11th edition | date = January 22, 2012 | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0205239399}}</ref> A similar imaging process to PET is [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT), which also uses [[Radioligand|radioligands]] to detect molecules in the brain, and is less expensive.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:16slicePETCT.jpg|thumb|PET/CT-System with 16-slice CT; the ceiling mounted device is an injection pump for CT contrast agent]]\nPET is both a medical and research tool. It is used heavily in clinical [[oncology]] ([[radiology|medical imaging]] of [[tumour]]s and the search for [[metastasis|metastases]]), and for clinical diagnosis of certain diffuse brain diseases such as those causing various types of dementias. PET is also an important research tool to map normal human brain and heart function, and support drug development.\n\nPET is also used in pre-clinical studies using animals, where it allows repeated investigations into the same subjects. This is particularly valuable in cancer research, as it results in an increase in the statistical quality of the data (subjects can act as their own control) and substantially reduces the numbers of animals required for a given study.\n\nAlternative methods of scanning include [[x-ray]] [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[ultrasound]] and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT).\n\nWhile some imaging scans such as CT and MRI isolate organic anatomic changes in the body, PET and SPECT are capable of detecting areas of [[molecular biology]] detail (even prior to anatomic change). PET scanning does this using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake depending on the type and function of tissue involved. Changing of regional blood flow in various anatomic structures (as a measure of the injected positron emitter) can be visualized and relatively quantified with a PET scan.\n\nPET imaging is best performed using a dedicated PET scanner. It is also possible to acquire PET images using a conventional dual-head [[gamma camera]] fitted with a coincidence detector. Although the quality of gamma-camera PET is considerably lower and acquisition is slower, this method allows institutions with low demand for PET to provide on-site imaging, instead of referring patients to another center or relying on a visit by a mobile scanner.\n\n===Oncology===\n[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG.

In addition, a large metastatic tumor mass from colon cancer is seen in the liver.]]\nPET scanning with the tracer [[fluorine-18]] (<sup>18</sup>F) [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), called FDG-PET, is widely used in clinical [[oncology]]. This tracer is a [[glucose]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by [[hexokinase]] (whose [[mitochondrial]] form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing [[malignant]] tumors). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan has an effective radiation dose of 7.6&nbsp;[[mSv]].<ref name=\"Exposure\">ARSAC - Notes for Guidance on the Clinical Administration of Radiopharmaceuticals and use of Sealed Sources (March 2018 p.35)</ref> Because the hydroxyl group that is replaced by fluorine-18 to generate FDG is required for the next step in [[Glycolysis#Sequence of reactions|glucose metabolism]] in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the [[phosphate]] added by [[hexokinase]]. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the normal brain, liver, kidneys, and most cancers. As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and [[lung cancer]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nA few other isotopes and radiotracers are slowly being introduced into oncology for specific purposes.

What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer [[oxygen]]-15. Because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical [[cyclotron]] for such uses, which is difficult. \n**'''Example''': In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as [[Alzheimer's disease|'''Alzheimer's''' disease]] greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. Some radioactive tracers used for Alzheimer's are [[Florbetapir (18F)|florbetapir F18]], [[Flutemetamol (18F)|flutemetamol F18]], and [[Florbetaben (18F)|florbetabenF18]], which are all used to detect [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta]] plaques (a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's) in the brain.\n**'''Examples''': PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of '''seizure''' focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several [[radiotracer]]s (i.e. [[radioligand]]s) have been developed for PET that are [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for specific [[neuroreceptor]] subtypes such as [<sup>11</sup>C] [[raclopride]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[fallypride]] and [<sup>18</sup>F] [[desmethoxyfallypride]] for [[dopamine]] D2/D3 receptors, [<sup>11</sup>C] McN 5652 and [<sup>11</sup>C] [[DASB]] for [[serotonin transporter]]s, [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Mefway]] for serotonin [[5-HT1A receptor|5HT1A receptors]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Nifene]] for [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-[[FDOPA]] for the [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|AADC enzyme]]). These agents permit the visualization of neuroreceptor pools in the context of a plurality of neuropsychiatric and neurologic illnesses.\n\n:The development of a number of novel probes for noninvasive, in vivo PET imaging of neuroaggregate in human brain has brought amyloid imaging to the doorstep of clinical use.

These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally used by the body such as [[glucose]] (or glucose analogues), [[water]], or [[ammonia]], or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as [[radiotracer]]s. PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. Thus, the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and radiotracers for new target molecules and processes are continuing to be synthesized; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. At present,{{when|date=February 2018}} by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (also called FDG or fludeoxyglucose), an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. This radiotracer is used in essentially all scans for oncology and most scans in neurology, and thus makes up the large majority of all of the radiotracer (> 95%) used in PET and PET-CT scanning.\n\nDue to the short half-lives of most positron-emitting radioisotopes, the radiotracers have traditionally been produced using a [[cyclotron]] in close proximity to the PET imaging facility. The half-life of fluorine-18 is long enough that radiotracers labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers. Recently [[rubidium]]-82 generators have become commercially available.<ref>Bracco Diagnostics, [http://www.nuclearonline.org/PI/Cardiogen.pdf CardioGen-82], 2000</ref> These contain strontium-82, which decays by [[electron capture]] to produce positron-emitting rubidium-82.\n\n=== Emission ===\n[[File:PET-schema.png|thumb|right|Schema of a PET acquisition process]]\nTo conduct the scan, a short-lived radioactive tracer [[isotope]] is injected into the living subject (usually into blood circulation). Each tracer atom has been chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule. There is a waiting period while the active molecule becomes concentrated in tissues of interest; then the subject is placed in the imaging scanner. The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is F-18 labeled [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), a sugar, for which the waiting period is typically an hour. During the scan, a record of tissue concentration is made as the tracer decays.\n\nAs the radioisotope undergoes [[positron emission]] decay (also known as positive [[beta decay]]), it emits a positron, an antiparticle of the [[electron]] with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1&nbsp;mm, but dependent on the isotope<ref>{{cite book | title=PET: physics, instrumentation, and scanners|author=Michael E.

These are detected when they reach a [[scintillator]] in the scanning device, creating a burst of light which is detected by [[photomultiplier]] tubes or silicon [[avalanche photodiode]]s (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite directions (they would be exactly opposite in their [[center of mass frame]], but the scanner has no way to know this, and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal \"pairs\" (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored.\n\n=== Localization of the positron annihilation event ===\nThe most significant fraction of electron\u2013positron annihilations results in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the '''line of response''', or '''LOR'''). In practice, the LOR has a non-zero width as the emitted photons are not exactly 180 degrees apart. If the resolving time of the detectors is less than 500 [[picoseconds]] rather than about 10 [[nanoseconds]], it is possible to localize the event to a segment of a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]], whose length is determined by the detector timing resolution. As the timing resolution improves, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of the image will improve, requiring fewer events to achieve the same image quality. This technology is not yet common, but it is available on some new systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628052004/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |title=Invitation to Cover: Advancements in \"Time-of-Flight\" Technology Make New PET/CT Scanner at Penn a First in the World |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania }}</ref>\n\n=== Image reconstruction ===\nThe raw data collected by a PET scanner are a list of 'coincidence events' representing near-simultaneous detection (typically, within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other) of annihilation photons by a pair of detectors. Each coincidence event represents a line in space connecting the two detectors along which the positron emission occurred (i.e., the line of response (LOR)).\n\nAnalytical techniques, much like the reconstruction of [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) data, are commonly used, although the [[data set]] collected in PET is much poorer than CT, so reconstruction techniques are more difficult. Coincidence events can be grouped into projection images, called [[Radon transform|sinograms]]. The sinograms are sorted by the angle of each view and tilt (for 3D images). The sinogram images are analogous to the projections captured by [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanners, and can be reconstructed in a similar way. The statistics of data thereby obtained are much worse than those obtained through transmission tomography. A normal PET data set has millions of counts for the whole acquisition, while the CT can reach a few billion counts. This contributes to PET images appearing \"noisier\" than CT. Two major sources of noise in PET are scatter (a detected pair of photons, at least one of which was deflected from its original path by interaction with matter in the field of view, leading to the pair being assigned to an incorrect LOR) and random events (photons originating from two different annihilation events but incorrectly recorded as a coincidence pair because their arrival at their respective detectors occurred within a coincidence timing window).\n\nIn practice, considerable pre-processing of the data is required\u2014correction for random coincidences, estimation and subtraction of [[compton scatter|scattered]] photons, detector [[Dead time|dead-time]] correction (after the detection of a photon, the detector must \"cool down\" again) and detector-sensitivity correction (for both inherent detector sensitivity and changes in sensitivity due to angle of incidence).\n\n[[Filtered back projection]] (FBP) has been frequently used to reconstruct images from the projections. This algorithm has the advantage of being simple while having a low requirement for computing resources. Disadvantages are that [[shot noise]] in the raw data is prominent in the reconstructed images, and areas of high tracer uptake tend to form streaks across the image. Also, FBP treats the data deterministically\u2014it does not account for the inherent randomness associated with PET data, thus requiring all the pre-reconstruction corrections described above.\n\n'''Statistical, likelihood-based approaches''':\nStatistical, likelihood-based <ref>{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=Lange|author2=Richard Carson |title=EM reconstruction algorithm for emission and transmission tomography|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography|date=1984|volume=8|issue=2|pages=306\u2013316|pmid=6608535}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Y.|author2=L.

These algorithms compute an estimate of the likely distribution of annihilation events that led to the measured data, based on statistical principles. The advantage is a better noise profile and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP, but the disadvantage is higher computer resource requirements. A further advantage of statistical image reconstruction techniques is that the physical effects that would need to be pre-corrected for when using an analytical reconstruction algorithm, such as scattered photons, random coincidences, attenuation and detector dead-time, can be incorporated into the likelihood model being used in the reconstruction, allowing for additional noise reduction. Iterative reconstruction has also been shown to result in improvements in the resolution of the reconstructed images, since more sophisticated models of the scanner Physics can be incorporated into the likelihood model than those used by analytical reconstruction methods, allowing for improved quantification of the radioactivity distribution.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Qi|first=J.|author2=R.

As different LORs must traverse different thicknesses of tissue, the photons are attenuated differentially. The result is that structures deep in the body are reconstructed as having falsely low tracer uptake. Contemporary scanners can estimate attenuation using integrated [[x-ray]] CT equipment, in place of earlier equipment that offered a crude form of CT using a [[gamma ray]] ([[positron]] emitting) source and the PET detectors.\n\nWhile attenuation-corrected images are generally more faithful representations, the correction process is itself susceptible to significant artifacts. As a result, both corrected and uncorrected images are always reconstructed and read together.\n\n'''2D/3D reconstruction''': Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single transverse plane. More modern scanners now include multiple rings, essentially forming a cylinder of detectors.\n\nThere are two approaches to reconstructing data from such a scanner: 1) treat each ring as a separate entity, so that only coincidences within a ring are detected, the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually (2D reconstruction), or 2) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings, then reconstruct the entire volume together (3D).\n\n3D techniques have better sensitivity (because more coincidences are detected and used) and therefore less noise, but are more sensitive to the effects of scatter and random coincidences, as well as requiring correspondingly greater computer resources. The advent of sub-nanosecond timing resolution detectors affords better random coincidence rejection, thus favoring 3D image reconstruction.\n\n'''Time-of-flight (TOF) PET''': For modern systems with a higher time resolution (roughly 3 nanoseconds) a technique called \"Time-of-flight\" is used to improve the overall performance. Time-of-flight PET makes use of very fast gamma-ray detectors and data processing system which can more precisely decide the difference in time between the detection of the two photons. Although it is technically impossible to localize the point of origin of the annihilation event exactly (currently within 10&nbsp;cm) thus image reconstruction is still needed, TOF technique gives a remarkable improvement in image quality, especially signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n=== Combination of PET with CT or MRI ===\n{{Main|PET-CT|PET-MRI}}\n[[File:Viewer medecine nucleaire keosys.JPG|thumb|left|Complete body PET-CT fusion image]]\n[[File:PET-MR2-Head-Keosys.JPG|thumb|right|Brain PET-MRI fusion image]]\nPET scans are increasingly read alongside CT or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans, with the combination (called [[Image registration|\"co-registration\"]]) giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, and what it is doing biochemically). Because PET imaging is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners (so-called \"PET-CT\"). Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between the two types of scans, the two sets of images are more precisely [[image registration|registered]], so that areas of abnormality on the PET imaging can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images.

Since the tracers are radioactive, the elderly{{Dubious|date=January 2020}} and pregnant are unable to use it due to risks posed by radiation. \n\nLimitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of [[cyclotrons]] needed to produce the short-lived [[radionuclide]]s for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals after radioisotope preparation. Organic radiotracer molecules that will contain a positron-emitting radioisotope cannot be synthesized first and then the radioisotope prepared within them, because bombardment with a cyclotron to prepare the radioisotope destroys any organic carrier for it. Instead, the isotope must be prepared first, then afterward, the chemistry to prepare any organic radiotracer (such as [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]]) accomplished very quickly, in the short time before the isotope decays. Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of radiotracers that can supply many sites simultaneously. This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with fluorine-18, which has a half-life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to rubidium-82 (used as [[rubidium-82 chloride]]) with a half-life of 1.27 minutes, which is created in a portable generator and is used for [[myocardium|myocardial]] [[perfusion]] studies. Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and \"hot labs\" (automated chemistry labs that are able to work with radioisotopes) have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals. The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |title=Technology |author=Lisa Fratt |date=July 2003 |website=Medical Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120152623/http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |archive-date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> In recent years the shortage of PET scans has been alleviated in the US, as rollout of radiopharmacies to supply radioisotopes has grown 30%/year.<ref>{{cite web |title=PET History and Overview |date=January 16, 2013 |url=http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |author=Michael Phelps |publisher=Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082954/http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |archive-date=May 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the half-life of fluorine-18 is about two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day.

The system detects pairs of [[gamma ray]]s emitted indirectly by a [[positron]]-emitting [[radioligand]], most commonly [[fluorine-18]], which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule called a [[radioactive tracer]]. Different ligands are used for different imaging purposes, depending on what the radiologist/researcher wants to detect. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern [[PET-CT|PET computed tomography]] scanners, three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a [[CT scan|computed tomography X-ray scan]] performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. \n\nIf the biologically active tracer molecule chosen for PET is [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), an [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[glucose]], the concentrations of tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of [[cancer]] [[metastasis]] (i.e., spreading to other sites) is the most common type of PET scan in standard medical care (representing 90% of current scans). [[Metabolic trapping]] of the radioactive glucose molecule allows the PET scan to be utilized.<ref>Miele, E.; Spinelli, G.

It is used heavily in clinical [[oncology]] ([[radiology|medical imaging]] of [[tumour]]s and the search for [[metastasis|metastases]]), and for clinical diagnosis of certain diffuse brain diseases such as those causing various types of dementias. PET is also an important research tool to map normal human brain and heart function, and support drug development.\n\nPET is also used in pre-clinical studies using animals, where it allows repeated investigations into the same subjects. This is particularly valuable in cancer research, as it results in an increase in the statistical quality of the data (subjects can act as their own control) and substantially reduces the numbers of animals required for a given study.\n\nAlternative methods of scanning include [[x-ray]] [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[ultrasound]] and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT).\n\nWhile some imaging scans such as CT and MRI isolate organic anatomic changes in the body, PET and SPECT are capable of detecting areas of [[molecular biology]] detail (even prior to anatomic change). PET scanning does this using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake depending on the type and function of tissue involved. Changing of regional blood flow in various anatomic structures (as a measure of the injected positron emitter) can be visualized and relatively quantified with a PET scan.\n\nPET imaging is best performed using a dedicated PET scanner. It is also possible to acquire PET images using a conventional dual-head [[gamma camera]] fitted with a coincidence detector. Although the quality of gamma-camera PET is considerably lower and acquisition is slower, this method allows institutions with low demand for PET to provide on-site imaging, instead of referring patients to another center or relying on a visit by a mobile scanner.\n\n===Oncology===\n[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG.

This tracer is a [[glucose]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by [[hexokinase]] (whose [[mitochondrial]] form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing [[malignant]] tumors).

Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the [[phosphate]] added by [[hexokinase]]. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the normal brain, liver, kidneys, and most cancers. As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and [[lung cancer]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nA few other isotopes and radiotracers are slowly being introduced into oncology for specific purposes.

What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer [[oxygen]]-15. Because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical [[cyclotron]] for such uses, which is difficult. \n**'''Example''': In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as [[Alzheimer's disease|'''Alzheimer's''' disease]] greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. Some radioactive tracers used for Alzheimer's are [[Florbetapir (18F)|florbetapir F18]], [[Flutemetamol (18F)|flutemetamol F18]], and [[Florbetaben (18F)|florbetabenF18]], which are all used to detect [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta]] plaques (a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's) in the brain.\n**'''Examples''': PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of '''seizure''' focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several [[radiotracer]]s (i.e. [[radioligand]]s) have been developed for PET that are [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for specific [[neuroreceptor]] subtypes such as [<sup>11</sup>C] [[raclopride]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[fallypride]] and [<sup>18</sup>F] [[desmethoxyfallypride]] for [[dopamine]] D2/D3 receptors, [<sup>11</sup>C] McN 5652 and [<sup>11</sup>C] [[DASB]] for [[serotonin transporter]]s, [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Mefway]] for serotonin [[5-HT1A receptor|5HT1A receptors]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Nifene]] for [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-[[FDOPA]] for the [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|AADC enzyme]]).

These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally used by the body such as [[glucose]] (or glucose analogues), [[water]], or [[ammonia]], or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as [[radiotracer]]s. PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. Thus, the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and radiotracers for new target molecules and processes are continuing to be synthesized; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. At present,{{when|date=February 2018}} by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (also called FDG or fludeoxyglucose), an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. This radiotracer is used in essentially all scans for oncology and most scans in neurology, and thus makes up the large majority of all of the radiotracer (> 95%) used in PET and PET-CT scanning.\n\nDue to the short half-lives of most positron-emitting radioisotopes, the radiotracers have traditionally been produced using a [[cyclotron]] in close proximity to the PET imaging facility. The half-life of fluorine-18 is long enough that radiotracers labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers. Recently [[rubidium]]-82 generators have become commercially available.<ref>Bracco Diagnostics, [http://www.nuclearonline.org/PI/Cardiogen.pdf CardioGen-82], 2000</ref> These contain strontium-82, which decays by [[electron capture]] to produce positron-emitting rubidium-82.\n\n=== Emission ===\n[[File:PET-schema.png|thumb|right|Schema of a PET acquisition process]]\nTo conduct the scan, a short-lived radioactive tracer [[isotope]] is injected into the living subject (usually into blood circulation). Each tracer atom has been chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule. There is a waiting period while the active molecule becomes concentrated in tissues of interest; then the subject is placed in the imaging scanner. The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is F-18 labeled [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), a sugar, for which the waiting period is typically an hour. During the scan, a record of tissue concentration is made as the tracer decays.\n\nAs the radioisotope undergoes [[positron emission]] decay (also known as positive [[beta decay]]), it emits a positron, an antiparticle of the [[electron]] with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1&nbsp;mm, but dependent on the isotope<ref>{{cite book | title=PET: physics, instrumentation, and scanners|author=Michael E.

These are detected when they reach a [[scintillator]] in the scanning device, creating a burst of light which is detected by [[photomultiplier]] tubes or silicon [[avalanche photodiode]]s (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite directions (they would be exactly opposite in their [[center of mass frame]], but the scanner has no way to know this, and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal \"pairs\" (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored.\n\n=== Localization of the positron annihilation event ===\nThe most significant fraction of electron\u2013positron annihilations results in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the '''line of response''', or '''LOR'''). In practice, the LOR has a non-zero width as the emitted photons are not exactly 180 degrees apart. If the resolving time of the detectors is less than 500 [[picoseconds]] rather than about 10 [[nanoseconds]], it is possible to localize the event to a segment of a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]], whose length is determined by the detector timing resolution. As the timing resolution improves, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of the image will improve, requiring fewer events to achieve the same image quality. This technology is not yet common, but it is available on some new systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628052004/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |title=Invitation to Cover: Advancements in \"Time-of-Flight\" Technology Make New PET/CT Scanner at Penn a First in the World |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania }}</ref>\n\n=== Image reconstruction ===\nThe raw data collected by a PET scanner are a list of 'coincidence events' representing near-simultaneous detection (typically, within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other) of annihilation photons by a pair of detectors. Each coincidence event represents a line in space connecting the two detectors along which the positron emission occurred (i.e., the line of response (LOR)).\n\nAnalytical techniques, much like the reconstruction of [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) data, are commonly used, although the [[data set]] collected in PET is much poorer than CT, so reconstruction techniques are more difficult. Coincidence events can be grouped into projection images, called [[Radon transform|sinograms]]. The sinograms are sorted by the angle of each view and tilt (for 3D images). The sinogram images are analogous to the projections captured by [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanners, and can be reconstructed in a similar way. The statistics of data thereby obtained are much worse than those obtained through transmission tomography. A normal PET data set has millions of counts for the whole acquisition, while the CT can reach a few billion counts. This contributes to PET images appearing \"noisier\" than CT. Two major sources of noise in PET are scatter (a detected pair of photons, at least one of which was deflected from its original path by interaction with matter in the field of view, leading to the pair being assigned to an incorrect LOR) and random events (photons originating from two different annihilation events but incorrectly recorded as a coincidence pair because their arrival at their respective detectors occurred within a coincidence timing window).\n\nIn practice, considerable pre-processing of the data is required\u2014correction for random coincidences, estimation and subtraction of [[compton scatter|scattered]] photons, detector [[Dead time|dead-time]] correction (after the detection of a photon, the detector must \"cool down\" again) and detector-sensitivity correction (for both inherent detector sensitivity and changes in sensitivity due to angle of incidence).\n\n[[Filtered back projection]] (FBP) has been frequently used to reconstruct images from the projections. This algorithm has the advantage of being simple while having a low requirement for computing resources. Disadvantages are that [[shot noise]] in the raw data is prominent in the reconstructed images, and areas of high tracer uptake tend to form streaks across the image. Also, FBP treats the data deterministically\u2014it does not account for the inherent randomness associated with PET data, thus requiring all the pre-reconstruction corrections described above.\n\n'''Statistical, likelihood-based approaches''':\nStatistical, likelihood-based <ref>{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=Lange|author2=Richard Carson |title=EM reconstruction algorithm for emission and transmission tomography|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography|date=1984|volume=8|issue=2|pages=306\u2013316|pmid=6608535}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Y.|author2=L.

These algorithms compute an estimate of the likely distribution of annihilation events that led to the measured data, based on statistical principles. The advantage is a better noise profile and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP, but the disadvantage is higher computer resource requirements. A further advantage of statistical image reconstruction techniques is that the physical effects that would need to be pre-corrected for when using an analytical reconstruction algorithm, such as scattered photons, random coincidences, attenuation and detector dead-time, can be incorporated into the likelihood model being used in the reconstruction, allowing for additional noise reduction. Iterative reconstruction has also been shown to result in improvements in the resolution of the reconstructed images, since more sophisticated models of the scanner Physics can be incorporated into the likelihood model than those used by analytical reconstruction methods, allowing for improved quantification of the radioactivity distribution.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Qi|first=J.|author2=R.

As different LORs must traverse different thicknesses of tissue, the photons are attenuated differentially. The result is that structures deep in the body are reconstructed as having falsely low tracer uptake. Contemporary scanners can estimate attenuation using integrated [[x-ray]] CT equipment, in place of earlier equipment that offered a crude form of CT using a [[gamma ray]] ([[positron]] emitting) source and the PET detectors.\n\nWhile attenuation-corrected images are generally more faithful representations, the correction process is itself susceptible to significant artifacts. As a result, both corrected and uncorrected images are always reconstructed and read together.\n\n'''2D/3D reconstruction''': Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single transverse plane. More modern scanners now include multiple rings, essentially forming a cylinder of detectors.\n\nThere are two approaches to reconstructing data from such a scanner: 1) treat each ring as a separate entity, so that only coincidences within a ring are detected, the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually (2D reconstruction), or 2) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings, then reconstruct the entire volume together (3D).\n\n3D techniques have better sensitivity (because more coincidences are detected and used) and therefore less noise, but are more sensitive to the effects of scatter and random coincidences, as well as requiring correspondingly greater computer resources. The advent of sub-nanosecond timing resolution detectors affords better random coincidence rejection, thus favoring 3D image reconstruction.\n\n'''Time-of-flight (TOF) PET''': For modern systems with a higher time resolution (roughly 3 nanoseconds) a technique called \"Time-of-flight\" is used to improve the overall performance. Time-of-flight PET makes use of very fast gamma-ray detectors and data processing system which can more precisely decide the difference in time between the detection of the two photons. Although it is technically impossible to localize the point of origin of the annihilation event exactly (currently within 10&nbsp;cm) thus image reconstruction is still needed, TOF technique gives a remarkable improvement in image quality, especially signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n=== Combination of PET with CT or MRI ===\n{{Main|PET-CT|PET-MRI}}\n[[File:Viewer medecine nucleaire keosys.JPG|thumb|left|Complete body PET-CT fusion image]]\n[[File:PET-MR2-Head-Keosys.JPG|thumb|right|Brain PET-MRI fusion image]]\nPET scans are increasingly read alongside CT or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans, with the combination (called [[Image registration|\"co-registration\"]]) giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, and what it is doing biochemically). Because PET imaging is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners (so-called \"PET-CT\"). Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between the two types of scans, the two sets of images are more precisely [[image registration|registered]], so that areas of abnormality on the PET imaging can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images. This is very useful in showing detailed views of moving organs or structures with higher anatomical variation, which is more common outside the brain.\n\nAt the [[Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] Institute of Neurosciences and Biophysics, the world's largest PET-MRI device began operation in April 2009: a 9.4-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic resonance tomograph (MRT) combined with a positron emission tomograph (PET).

Since the tracers are radioactive, the elderly{{Dubious|date=January 2020}} and pregnant are unable to use it due to risks posed by radiation. \n\nLimitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of [[cyclotrons]] needed to produce the short-lived [[radionuclide]]s for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals after radioisotope preparation. Organic radiotracer molecules that will contain a positron-emitting radioisotope cannot be synthesized first and then the radioisotope prepared within them, because bombardment with a cyclotron to prepare the radioisotope destroys any organic carrier for it. Instead, the isotope must be prepared first, then afterward, the chemistry to prepare any organic radiotracer (such as [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]]) accomplished very quickly, in the short time before the isotope decays. Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of radiotracers that can supply many sites simultaneously. This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with fluorine-18, which has a half-life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to rubidium-82 (used as [[rubidium-82 chloride]]) with a half-life of 1.27 minutes, which is created in a portable generator and is used for [[myocardium|myocardial]] [[perfusion]] studies. Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and \"hot labs\" (automated chemistry labs that are able to work with radioisotopes) have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals. The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |title=Technology |author=Lisa Fratt |date=July 2003 |website=Medical Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120152623/http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |archive-date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> In recent years the shortage of PET scans has been alleviated in the US, as rollout of radiopharmacies to supply radioisotopes has grown 30%/year.<ref>{{cite web |title=PET History and Overview |date=January 16, 2013 |url=http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |author=Michael Phelps |publisher=Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082954/http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |archive-date=May 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the half-life of fluorine-18 is about two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day.
