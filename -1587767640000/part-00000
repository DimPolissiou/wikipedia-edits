The country has missed only four contests, twice because the dates coincided with [[Remembrance of the Dead]] (1985, 1991) and twice because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year (1995 and 2002). The Netherlands hosted the contest in [[Hilversum]] ({{escyr|1958}}), [[Amsterdam]] ({{escyr|1970}}), twice in [[The Hague]] ({{escyr|1976}} and {{escyr|1980}}), and would've hosted the contest in [[Rotterdam]] in {{escyr|2020}} but it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will host the 2021 contest instead. \n\nThe Netherlands has won the contest five times, with [[Corry Brokken]] ({{escyr|1957}}), [[Teddy Scholten]] ({{escyr|1959}}), [[Lenny Kuhr]] in a four-way tie ({{escyr|1969}}), [[Teach-In (band)|Teach-In]] ({{escyr|1975}}) and [[Duncan Laurence]] ({{escyr|2019}}). The country's other top five results are [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]] fourth ({{escyr|1972}}), [[Mouth & MacNeal]] third ({{escyr|1974}}), [[Maggie MacNeal]] fifth  ({{escyr|1980}}), [[Marcha]] fifth ({{escyr|1987}}), [[Edsilia Rombley]] fourth ({{escyr|1998}}), and second with [[The Common Linnets]] ({{escyr|2014}}). The Netherlands finished last in {{escyr|1958}}, {{escyr|1962}}, {{escyr|1963}}, {{escyr|1968}}, and in the semifinal in {{escyr|2011}}.\n\nAfter the introduction of the semifinals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, the record of the contest, but have since reached six of the last seven finals.\n\n==History==\n\n===Fast Success===\n[[File:Eurovision Song Contest 1958 - Scoreboard.png|thumb|right|The {{Escyr|1958}} scoreboard]]\n\nThe Netherlands was one of seven countries competing in the inaugural {{Escyr|1956}} contest. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] presented the [[Nationaal Songfestival]] to select Dutch entries to the contest. [[Corry Brokken]] and [[Jetty Paerl]] finished top two and qualified to Lugano. After a year, success came fast as \"[[Net als toen]]\" from Brokken won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]] contest in [[Frankfurt]]. This song is a ballad asking the husband about early days as a couple. This song received points from every single country. Sem Nijveen provided the violin solo. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]] in [[Hilversum]]. Brokken's [[Heel de wereld]] received the first point from the first voting country, Switzerland, but it turned out to be the only point for her and finished tied ninth and last. Hosting and finishing last would not be repeated until Portugal in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]]. Austria in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] scored zero points but from tie-breaker finished second last. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]] in Cannes, the Netherlands was represented by [[Teddy Scholten]] after Brokken failed to qualify. [['n Beetje]] is about concentrating about being unfaithful in a relationship. the [[UK]] led before [[Italy]] sent seven points to the Dutch and France sent four more for another Dutch victory.\n\n===First Dark Age===\n\n[[Rudi Carrell]] and [[Annie Palmen]] won the national final with [[Wat een geluk]] in 1960 before Carrell was selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|the night]] but the song finished 12th (second last). [[Greetje Kauffeld]] failed to win three selections before being internally selected in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]] with [[Wat een dag]], which finished tied tenth. \\ [[De Spelbrekers]] won with \"[[Katinka (song)|Katinka]]\". This song is in the distinguished list for finishing last with 0 points but still being the more-remembered entries in the Netherlands from the dark age. In 1963, The members of the orchestra went on strike, which made the televised selection impossible. Palmen performed three songs for juries before \"Geen ander\", later renamed \"[[Een speeldoos]]\" was selected. The song once again finished tied last with zero points. Dutch-Indonesian [[Anneke Gr\u00f6nloh]] with \"[[Jij bent mijn leven]]\" finished tied tenth in 1964. The 1965 Nationaal Songfestival had five semi-finals to select the song for each entrant. It was hosted by Teddy Scholten. [[Conny Vandenbos]] won with \"[['t Is genoeg]]\". Norway gave was the only country yo give any points, the maximum 5 points, making the Netherlands finish 11th. [[Milly Scott]] was the first black performer to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966]], [[Ireland]] and [[United Kingdom]] both gave \"[[Fernando en Filippo]]\" 1 point, having the Netherlands finish 15th. [[Harmelen]] hosted the 1967 selection. Winner [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Steinmetz]] finished 14th with \"[[Ring-dinge-ding]]\". in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968]], the Netherlands finished last again with \"[[Morgen]]\" from [[Ronnie Tober]].\n\n===From Lenny Kuhr to Teach-In===\n1969 Nationaal Songfestival brought Europe together by asking every single participating country in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]] to vote with Dutch juries. Conny Vink's \"De toeteraar\" was beaten by [[Lenny Kuhr]]'s \"[[De troubadour]]\". Dolf van der Linden refused to go to [[Madrid]] and the song was conducted by Frans de Kok. The last two countries brought the Netherlands, [[France]], the [[UK]] and [[Spain]] tied in first place with 18 points. Because there was no tie-breaking rule in place at the time, all 4 countries were announced as winners, which led to multiple countries withdrawing in 1970. The Netherlands beat France in coin-toss to host the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970]] in [[RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre|RAI Amsterdam]]. [[Hearts of Soul]] finished 7th with \"[[Waterman (song)|Waterman]]\". [[Saskia & Serge]] finished second in 1970 national final before being internally selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]]. The ballad \"[[Tijd]]\" finished tied sixth that night. It was the last song Dolf van der Linden conducted after 13 songs were conducted by him, of which two victories. [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]]'s \"[[Als het om de liefde gaat]]\" was the first entry where the audience clapped allong. The Netherlands finished fourth, one point behind Germany. After \"[[De oude muzikant]]\" from [[Ben Cramer]] finished 14th in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]], the country sent [[Mouth & MacNeal]] with \"[[I See a Star]]\". 1974 was the first year that allowed songs to be in English, so the lyrics where changed to English. At [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|the contest]], had to face stars like [[ABBA]], former winner [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] before finishing third. 1975 Nationaal Songfestival  [[Teach-In]] with [[Ding-a-dong]] won the 1975 Nationaal Songfestival, which was the first time since 1970 that the singers weren't internally selected. The song received six twelve points, winning the contest for the fourth time, being the first song to win while allocated te first slot.\n\n===Multiple hostings===\n[[File:Sandra Reemer cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandra Reemer]] with the outfit she wore in {{Escyr|1979}}]]\n[[The Hague]] hosted Eurovision 1976 in [[World Forum (The Hague)|Congresgebouw]] with former winner Corry Brokken presenting the show. [[Sandra Reemer]] returned with \"[[The Party's Over (Sandra Reemer song)|The Party's Over]]\" finishing 9th. The country slumped to three non top-tens after, \"[[De mallemolen]]\" with Heddy Lester, 12th, \"[['t Is OK]]\" with Harmony, 13th, and the band [[Xandra]], once again with Sandra Reemer, with \"[[Colorado (song)|Colorado]]\", finishing 12th. The congresbouw returned to host [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 contest]] after Israel declined hostign after winning twice in a row and withdrew, because the date of the contest was the same as their rememberance day. [[Rogier van Otterloo]] made a debut as a conductor. Maggie MacNeal returned \"[[Amsterdam (Maggie MacNeal song)|Amsterdam]]\". The song would be the last internally selected song until 2013. The song led the voting after first three twelve points from four countries. The song later slipped to fifth. Linda Williams went to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981]] with \"[[Het is een wonder]]\". Finished 7th. A year later [[The Millionaires]]'s \"Fantasie eiland\" controversially missed the ticket because expert juries sent \"[[Jij en ik]]\"  with [[Bill van Dijk]]. The English trio [[Tight Tit]] covered the song as [[Fantasy Island (The Millionaires song)|Fantasy Island]], which became a top 5 hit in The United Kingdom. In 1982 \"Fantasie eiland\" went on to win the [[OGAE Second Chance Contest]]. Germany's five points led ''Jij en ik'' to finished third last. The 1983 Nationaal Songfestival is also seen as dramatic. [[Vulcano]]'s [[Een beetje van dit]] tied with [[Bernadette]]'s \"[[Sing Me a Song]]\" before the last set of the jury votes gave Bernadette one point and Vulcano none, which sent her to Munich. The Netherlands finished 7th. After almost winning the Nationaal Songfestival in 1981, [[Maribelle]] represented the country in 1984 with\"[[Ik hou van jou]]\", the entry finished 13th before the first ever withdrawn in 1985 due to the Dutch rememberance of the dead.\n\n===Before the Dublin sinking===\n\nThe girl group [[Frizzle Sizzle]] was the Dutch entry in 1986 with \"[[Alles heeft ritme]]\", which again finished 13th. at the 1987's Nationaal Songfestival [[Marcha]] sang all six songs before \"[[Rechtop in de wind]]\" selected. Marcha finished tied fifth, first top five since 1980. The song was the last ever conducted by van Otterloo before his death from cancer. [[Gerard Joling]] was preselected in 1988 before \"[[Shangri-la]]\", was selected. The song later finished ninth. From that song, one of the chorus members, Justine Pelmelay won the selection in 1989 but \"[[Blijf zoals je bent]]\" finished 15th. The country was represented by sisters [[Maywood (duo)|Maywood]] with the power ballad \"[[Ik wil alles met je delen]]\", finishing 15th again. As the contest was held on May 4th, 1991, The Netherlands missed the 1991 contest. Humphrey Campbell won the 1992 selection with \"[[Wijs me de weg]]\", which finished ninth. [[Ruth Jacott]] was selected for 1993. In the end \"[[Vrede]]\" was the winning entry. The song finished sixth. [[Willeke Alberti]] was pre-selected for 1994 with the ballad \"[[Waar is de zon?]]\" which received four points, finishing 23rd which meant that the Netherlands couldn't participate in the 1995 contest.\n\n===The Changing Era===\n\nNationaal Songfestival returned in 1996 with five semi-finals to select a song for each singer. Maxine and Franklin Brown represented the country with \"[[De eerste keer]]\". The song finished seventh, after an error. [[Dick Bakker]] made a debut as a conductor, he co-wrote the winning entry in 1975. In 1997, Mrs. Einstein, which the German television jokingly announced as ''the Dutch Spice Grandmothers'', represented the Netherlands with \"[[Niemand heeft nog tijd]]\" finishing tied 22nd with five points. Nurlaila's \"Alsof je bij me bent\" finished second in pre-selection but winning OGAE Second Chance Contest 1998. The winning entry was [[Edsilia Rombley]]'s \"[[Hemel en aarde]]\" it even led the voting for some time, the last time until 2014. The song finished fourth in the end. The best result since 1975. [[Marlayne]] won the Dutch final. she came tied 8th with the song \"[[One Good Reason (Marlayne song)|One Good Reason]]\". In 2000, the song, \"[[No Goodbyes (Linda song)|No Goodbyes]]\" sung by [[Linda Wagenmakers]] came 13th. 2001 [[Michelle Courtens|Michelle]] and her song ''Out on My Own (Michelle song)|Out on My Own'' Finished 18th the Netherlands was not allowed to participate in 2002 due to poor results. [[Esther Hart]] won the national final in 2003 with the same writing team as 1999.  Esther finished in 13th place. The country sent the male duo [[Re-Union]] in 2004 with the song \"[[Without You (Re-Union song)|Without You]]\" and made it to the grand final. They got 11 points and a 20th place.\n\n===The Modern Dark Age===\n\nIn 2005 [[Glennis Grace]]'s ''[[My Impossible Dream]]'' failed to reach the Grand Final. [[Treble]] could also not qualify a year later, with their song ''[[Amambanda]]''. In 2007 Edsilia returned with her song [[On Top of the World (Edsilia Rombley song)|On Top Of The World]]. She could not repeat her 1998 success. In 2008 [[Hind]] participated with the song ''[[Your Heart Belongs to Me (Hind song)|Your Heart Belongs to Me]]'' she failed to qualify. In 2009 [[De Toppers]]'s ''[[Shine (De Toppers song)|Shine]]'' didn't qualify. The year after [[Sieneke]] won a very chaotic national final but she also failed to qualify with ''[[Ik ben verliefd (Sha-la-lie)]]'' sung in Dutch. The [[3JS]] and [[Joan Franka]] also failed to qualify making the Netherlands the country with the longest period of non-qualification.\n\n===The Dutch Renaissance===\n\nThe string of consecutive non-qualifications of much of the 2000s and early 2010s led the Dutch broadcaster to re-think their strategy by internaly selecting [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]]. Anouk chose the song and the background singers herself and went on to break the Netherlands' long non-qualification streak. She gave the country its first top 10 placing since 1999. The following year [[The Common Linnets]]' won their semifinal and finishing second overall.  After a non-qualification with [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] in 2015 who sang a song by Anouk, the Dutch then recorded four consecutive qualifications with [[Douwe Bob]] and [[OG3NE]] both finishing in 11th place in their respective appearances, and returning singer [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]] placing 18th. [[Duncan Laurence]] brought the country its 5th overall victory (tying France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and first win in 44 years with his song \"[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]\".\n\n==Non-participations==\nThe Netherlands has missed only four contests in its Eurovision history. The first one was at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 contest]], held in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The contest, held on 4 May conflicted with the Dutch [[Remembrance of the Dead]] and therefore the Netherlands withdrew.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301#event_info_301 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926015328/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301 |date=2008-09-26 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]] the contest was again held on 4 May, and so the Netherlands withdrew for the same reason as six years earlier.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828143907/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 |date=2008-08-28 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nThere was no Dutch participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] contests, due to relegation as a result of the country's poor showings in the previous year.\n\nThe Netherlands did compete in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]].

The country has missed only four contests, twice because the dates coincided with [[Remembrance of the Dead]] (1985, 1991) and twice because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year (1995 and 2002). The Netherlands hosted the contest in [[Hilversum]] ({{escyr|1958}}), [[Amsterdam]] ({{escyr|1970}}), twice in [[The Hague]] ({{escyr|1976}} and {{escyr|1980}}), and would've hosted the contest in [[Rotterdam]] in {{escyr|2020}} but it was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will host the 2021 contest instead. \n\nThe Netherlands has won the contest five times, with [[Corry Brokken]] ({{escyr|1957}}), [[Teddy Scholten]] ({{escyr|1959}}), [[Lenny Kuhr]] in a four-way tie ({{escyr|1969}}), [[Teach-In (band)|Teach-In]] ({{escyr|1975}}) and [[Duncan Laurence]] ({{escyr|2019}}). The country's other top five results are [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]] fourth ({{escyr|1972}}), [[Mouth & MacNeal]] third ({{escyr|1974}}), [[Maggie MacNeal]] fifth  ({{escyr|1980}}), [[Marcha]] fifth ({{escyr|1987}}), [[Edsilia Rombley]] fourth ({{escyr|1998}}), and second with [[The Common Linnets]] ({{escyr|2014}}). The Netherlands finished last in {{escyr|1958}}, {{escyr|1962}}, {{escyr|1963}}, {{escyr|1968}}, and in the semifinal in {{escyr|2011}}.\n\nAfter the introduction of the semifinals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, the record of the contest, but have since reached six of the last seven finals.\n\n==History==\n\n===Fast Success===\n[[File:Eurovision Song Contest 1958 - Scoreboard.png|thumb|right|The {{Escyr|1958}} scoreboard]]\n\nThe Netherlands was one of seven countries competing in the inaugural {{Escyr|1956}} contest. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] presented the [[Nationaal Songfestival]] to select Dutch entries to the contest. [[Corry Brokken]] and [[Jetty Paerl]] finished top two and qualified to Lugano. After a year, success came fast as \"[[Net als toen]]\" from Brokken won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]] contest in [[Frankfurt]]. This song is a ballad asking the husband about early days as a couple. This song received points from every single country. Sem Nijveen provided the violin solo. [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NTS]] hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]] in [[Hilversum]]. Brokken's [[Heel de wereld]] received the first point from the first voting country, Switzerland, but it turned out to be the only point for her and finished tied ninth and last. Hosting and finishing last would not be repeated until Portugal in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]]. Austria in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] scored zero points but from tie-breaker finished second last. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]] in Cannes, the Netherlands was represented by [[Teddy Scholten]] after Brokken failed to qualify. [['n Beetje]] is about concentrating about being unfaithful in a relationship. the [[UK]] led before [[Italy]] sent seven points to the Dutch and France sent four more for another Dutch victory.\n\n===First Dark Age===\n\n[[Rudi Carrell]] and [[Annie Palmen]] won the national final with [[Wat een geluk]] in 1960 before Carrell was selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|the night]] but the song finished 12th (second last). [[Greetje Kauffeld]] failed to win three selections before being internally selected in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]] with [[Wat een dag]], which finished tied tenth. \\ [[De Spelbrekers]] won with \"[[Katinka (song)|Katinka]]\". This song is in the distinguished list for finishing last with 0 points but still being the more-remembered entries in the Netherlands from the dark age. In 1963, The members of the orchestra went on strike, which made the televised selection impossible. Palmen performed three songs for juries before \"Geen ander\", later renamed \"[[Een speeldoos]]\" was selected. The song once again finished tied last with zero points. Dutch-Indonesian [[Anneke Gr\u00f6nloh]] with \"[[Jij bent mijn leven]]\" finished tied tenth in 1964. The 1965 Nationaal Songfestival had five semi-finals to select the song for each entrant. It was hosted by Teddy Scholten. [[Conny Vandenbos]] won with \"[['t Is genoeg]]\". Norway gave was the only country yo give any points, the maximum 5 points, making the Netherlands finish 11th. [[Milly Scott]] was the first black performer to participate in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966]], [[Ireland]] and [[United Kingdom]] both gave \"[[Fernando en Filippo]]\" 1 point, having the Netherlands finish 15th. [[Harmelen]] hosted the 1967 selection. Winner [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Steinmetz]] finished 14th with \"[[Ring-dinge-ding]]\". in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968]], the Netherlands finished last again with \"[[Morgen]]\" from [[Ronnie Tober]].\n\n===From Lenny Kuhr to Teach-In===\n1969 Nationaal Songfestival brought Europe together by asking every single participating country in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]] to vote with Dutch juries. Conny Vink's \"De toeteraar\" was beaten by [[Lenny Kuhr]]'s \"[[De troubadour]]\". Dolf van der Linden refused to go to [[Madrid]] and the song was conducted by Frans de Kok. The last two countries brought the Netherlands, [[France]], the [[UK]] and [[Spain]] tied in first place with 18 points. Because there was no tie-breaking rule in place at the time, all 4 countries were announced as winners, which led to multiple countries withdrawing in 1970. The Netherlands beat France in coin-toss to host the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970]] in [[RAI Amsterdam Convention Centre|RAI Amsterdam]]. [[Hearts of Soul]] finished 7th with \"[[Waterman (song)|Waterman]]\". [[Saskia & Serge]] finished second in 1970 national final before being internally selected for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]]. The ballad \"[[Tijd]]\" finished tied sixth that night. It was the last song Dolf van der Linden conducted after 13 songs were conducted by him, of which two victories. [[Sandra Reemer|Sandra]] & [[Dries Holten|Andres]]'s \"[[Als het om de liefde gaat]]\" was the first entry where the audience clapped allong. The Netherlands finished fourth, one point behind Germany. After \"[[De oude muzikant]]\" from [[Ben Cramer]] finished 14th in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]], the country sent [[Mouth & MacNeal]] with \"[[I See a Star]]\". 1974 was the first year that allowed songs to be in English, so the lyrics where changed to English. At [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|the contest]], had to face stars like [[ABBA]], former winner [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] before finishing third. 1975 Nationaal Songfestival  [[Teach-In]] with [[Ding-a-dong]] won the 1975 Nationaal Songfestival, which was the first time since 1970 that the singers weren't internally selected. The song received six twelve points, winning the contest for the fourth time, being the first song to win while allocated te first slot.\n\n===Multiple hostings===\n[[File:Sandra Reemer cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandra Reemer]] with the outfit she wore in {{Escyr|1979}}]]\n[[The Hague]] hosted Eurovision 1976 in [[World Forum (The Hague)|Congresgebouw]] with former winner Corry Brokken presenting the show. [[Sandra Reemer]] returned with \"[[The Party's Over (Sandra Reemer song)|The Party's Over]]\" finishing 9th. The country slumped to three non top-tens after, \"[[De mallemolen]]\" with Heddy Lester, 12th, \"[['t Is OK]]\" with Harmony, 13th, and the band [[Xandra]], once again with Sandra Reemer, with \"[[Colorado (song)|Colorado]]\", finishing 12th. The congresbouw returned to host [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 contest]] after Israel declined hostign after winning twice in a row and withdrew, because the date of the contest was the same as their rememberance day. [[Rogier van Otterloo]] made a debut as a conductor. Maggie MacNeal returned \"[[Amsterdam (Maggie MacNeal song)|Amsterdam]]\". The song would be the last internally selected song until 2013. The song led the voting after first three twelve points from four countries. The song later slipped to fifth. Linda Williams went to [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981]] with \"[[Het is een wonder]]\". Finished 7th. A year later [[The Millionaires]]'s \"Fantasie eiland\" controversially missed the ticket because expert juries sent \"[[Jij en ik]]\"  with [[Bill van Dijk]]. The English trio [[Tight Tit]] covered the song as [[Fantasy Island (The Millionaires song)|Fantasy Island]], which became a top 5 hit in The United Kingdom. In 1982 \"Fantasie eiland\" went on to win the [[OGAE Second Chance Contest]]. Germany's five points led ''Jij en ik'' to finished third last. The 1983 Nationaal Songfestival is also seen as dramatic. [[Vulcano]]'s [[Een beetje van dit]] tied with [[Bernadette]]'s \"[[Sing Me a Song]]\" before the last set of the jury votes gave Bernadette one point and Vulcano none, which sent her to Munich. The Netherlands finished 7th. After almost winning the Nationaal Songfestival in 1981, [[Maribelle]] represented the country in 1984 with\"[[Ik hou van jou]]\", the entry finished 13th before the first ever withdrawn in 1985 due to the Dutch rememberance of the dead.\n\n===Before the Dublin sinking===\n\nThe girl group [[Frizzle Sizzle]] was the Dutch entry in 1986 with \"[[Alles heeft ritme]]\", which again finished 13th. at the 1987's Nationaal Songfestival [[Marcha]] sang all six songs before \"[[Rechtop in de wind]]\" selected. Marcha finished tied fifth, first top five since 1980. The song was the last ever conducted by van Otterloo before his death from cancer. [[Gerard Joling]] was preselected in 1988 before \"[[Shangri-la]]\", was selected. The song later finished ninth. From that song, one of the chorus members, Justine Pelmelay won the selection in 1989 but \"[[Blijf zoals je bent]]\" finished 15th. The country was represented by sisters [[Maywood (duo)|Maywood]] with the power ballad \"[[Ik wil alles met je delen]]\", finishing 15th again. As the contest was held on May 4th, 1991, The Netherlands missed the 1991 contest. Humphrey Campbell won the 1992 selection with \"[[Wijs me de weg]]\", which finished ninth. [[Ruth Jacott]] was selected for 1993. In the end \"[[Vrede]]\" was the winning entry. The song finished sixth. [[Willeke Alberti]] was pre-selected for 1994 with the ballad \"[[Waar is de zon?]]\" which received four points, finishing 23rd which meant that the Netherlands couldn't participate in the 1995 contest.\n\n===The Changing Era===\n\nNationaal Songfestival returned in 1996 with five semi-finals to select a song for each singer. Maxine and Franklin Brown represented the country with \"[[De eerste keer]]\". The song finished seventh, after an error. [[Dick Bakker]] made a debut as a conductor, he co-wrote the winning entry in 1975. In 1997, Mrs. Einstein, which the German television jokingly announced as ''the Dutch Spice Grandmothers'', represented the Netherlands with \"[[Niemand heeft nog tijd]]\" finishing tied 22nd with five points. Nurlaila's \"Alsof je bij me bent\" finished second in pre-selection but winning OGAE Second Chance Contest 1998.

[[Marlayne]] won the Dutch final. she came tied 8th with the song \"[[One Good Reason (Marlayne song)|One Good Reason]]\". In 2000, the song, \"[[No Goodbyes (Linda song)|No Goodbyes]]\" sung by [[Linda Wagenmakers]] came 13th. 2001 [[Michelle Courtens|Michelle]] and her song ''Out on My Own (Michelle song)|Out on My Own'' Finished 18th the Netherlands was not allowed to participate in 2002 due to poor results. [[Esther Hart]] won the national final in 2003 with the same writing team as 1999.  Esther finished in 13th place. The country sent the male duo [[Re-Union]] in 2004 with the song \"[[Without You (Re-Union song)|Without You]]\" and made it to the grand final. They got 11 points and a 20th place.\n\n===The Modern Dark Age===\n\nIn 2005 [[Glennis Grace]]'s ''[[My Impossible Dream]]'' failed to reach the Grand Final. [[Treble]] could also not qualify a year later, with their song ''[[Amambanda]]''. In 2007 Edsilia returned with her song [[On Top of the World (Edsilia Rombley song)|On Top Of The World]]. She could not repeat her 1998 sucess. In 2008 [[Hind]] participated with the song ''[[Your Heart Belongs to Me (Hind song)|Your Heart Belongs to Me]]'' she failed to qualify. In 2009 [[De Toppers]]'s ''[[Shine (De Toppers song)|Shine]]'' didn't qualify. The year after [[Sieneke]] won a very chaotic national final but she also failed to qualify with ''[[Ik ben verliefd (Sha-la-lie)]]'' sung in Dutch. The [[3JS]] and [[Joan Franka]] also failed to qualify making the Netherlands the country with the longest period of non-qualification.\n\n===The Dutch Renaissance===\n\nThe string of consecutive non-qualifications of much of the 2000s and early 2010s led the Dutch broadcaster to re-think their strategy by internaly selecting [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]]. Anouk chose the song and the background singers herself and went on to break the Netherlands' long non-qualification streak. She gave the country its first top 10 placing since 1999. The following year [[The Common Linnets]]' won their semifinal and finishing second overall.  After a non-qualification with [[Trijntje Oosterhuis]] in 2015 who sang a song by Anouk, the Dutch then recorded four consecutive qualifications with [[Douwe Bob]] and [[OG3NE]] both finishing in 11th place in their respective appearances, and returning singer [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]] placing 18th. [[Duncan Laurence]] brought the country its 5th overall victory (tying France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and first win in 44 years with his song \"[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]\".\n\n==Non-participations==\nThe Netherlands has missed only four contests in its Eurovision history. The first one was at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 contest]], held in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The contest, held on 4 May conflicted with the Dutch [[Remembrance of the Dead]] and therefore the Netherlands withdrew.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301#event_info_301 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926015328/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=301 |date=2008-09-26 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]] the contest was again held on 4 May, and so the Netherlands withdrew for the same reason as six years earlier.<ref>[http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 History - Eurovision Song Contest 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828143907/http://www.eurovision.tv/index/main?page=66&event=307 |date=2008-08-28 }} ''Eurovision.tv''</ref>\n\nThere was no Dutch participation in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] contests, due to relegation as a result of the country's poor showings in the previous year.\n\nThe Netherlands did compete in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]]. But at 22:00 ([[UTC+2]]) on Saturday 13 May, the broadcast was cancelled because of the [[Enschede fireworks disaster]] which happened a few hours before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vandaagindemuziek.nl/26_eurovisie_2000.htm|title=Eurovisie Songfestival: Deze Eeuw - vandaagindemuziek.nl - Day to Day|website=www.vandaagindemuziek.nl}}</ref> The points awarded by the Netherlands were taken from the back-up jury vote, as there was no televote after the program was cut short.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{|\n|+ '''Table key'''\n|{{legend|gold|Winner|text=1}}\n{{legend|silver|Second place|text=2}}\n{{legend|#C96|Third place|text=3}}\n{{legend|#FE8080|Last place|text=\u25c1}}\n{{legend|#A4EAA9|Entry selected but did not compete|text='''X'''}}\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Song\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Final\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Points\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Semi\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"silver\"\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|{{center|{{Escyr|1956}}}}\n|[[Jetty Paerl]]\n|[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n|\"[[De vogels van Holland]]\"\n|align=center|2{{Efn|name=\"esc 1956\"|The full results for the first contest in 1956 are unknown, only the winner was announced.

The simple explanation for allergic inflammation in asthma begins with the development of a predominantly helper T2 [[lymphocyte]]\u2013driven, as opposed to helper T1 [[lymphocyte]]\u2013driven, immune milieu, perhaps caused by certain types of immune stimulation early in life. This is followed by allergen exposure in a genetically susceptible individual.\n\nSpecific allergen exposure (e.g., [[Dust mite|dust mites]]) under the influence of helper [[T helper cell#Th1.2FTh2 model|T<sub>h</sub>2 helper T cells]] leads to [[B-lymphocyte]]<nowiki/>elaboration of [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) antibodies specific to that allergen. The IgE antibody attaches to surface receptors on airway [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] [[Mast cell|mast cells]]. One important question is whether [[Atopy|atopic]] individuals with asthma, in contrast to atopic persons without asthma, have a defect in mucosal integrity that makes them susceptible to penetration of allergens into the mucosa.\n\nSubsequent specific allergen exposure leads to cross-bridging of [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and release of a vast array of mediators. These mediators include [[histamine]]; [[Leukotriene|leukotrienes]] C4, D4, and E4; and a host of [[Cytokine|cytokines]]. Together, these mediators cause bronchial smooth muscle constriction, vascular leakage, inflammatory cell recruitment (with further mediator release), and mucous gland secretion. These processes lead to airway obstruction by constriction of the [[Smooth muscle|smooth muscles]], edema of the airways, influx of inflammatory cells, and formation of intraluminal mucus. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation is thought to cause the airway hyperreactivity characteristic of asthma. The more severe the airway obstruction, the more likely ventilation-perfusion mismatching will result in impaired gas exchange and [[Hypoxemia|low levels of oxygen in the blood]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nSevere Acute Asthma can be diagnosed by a primary care physician (PCP).

Thanks. -->The untitled fourth studio album by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]], commonly known as '''''Led Zeppelin IV''''', was released on 8 November 1971 by [[Atlantic Records]]. It was produced by guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and recorded between December 1970 and February 1971, mostly in the country house [[Headley Grange]]. The album is notable for featuring \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", which has been described as the band's [[List of signature songs|signature song]].\n\nThe informal setting at Headley Grange inspired the band, and allowed them to try different arrangements of material and create songs in a variety of styles. After the band's previous album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' received lukewarm reviews from critics, they decided their fourth album would officially be untitled, and would be represented instead by four symbols chosen by each band member, without featuring the name or any other details on the cover.  Unlike the prior two albums, the band was joined by some guest musicians.  Joining [[Robert Plant]] (vocals), [[Jimmy Page]] (guitar), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, multi-instrumentalist), and [[John Bonham]] (drums) were [[Fairport Convention]] vocalist [[Sandy Denny]] on \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\", and [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] pianist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] on \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\".  As with prior albums, most of the material was written by the band, though there was one cover song, a hard rock re-interpretation of the [[Memphis Minnie]] blues song \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\".\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success and is Led Zeppelin's best-selling, shipping over 37 million copies worldwide. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in the US]], while critics have regularly placed it highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:Headley Grange - geograph.org.uk - 29789.jpg|thumb|left|Most of the album was recorded at [[Headley Grange]] in Hampshire.]]\nFollowing the release of ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' in October 1970, the group took a break from live performances to concentrate on recording a follow-up. They turned down all touring offers, including a proposed New Year's Eve gig that would have been broadcast by television. They returned to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a country house in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, to write new material.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=67}}\n\nRecording sessions for the album began at [[Island Records]]' [[Sarm West Studios|Basing Street Studios]], London in December 1970.<ref name=theirtime>{{Cite news| title = Their Time is Gonna Come| newspaper = [[Classic Rock Magazine]]|date=December 2007| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> The group had considered [[Mick Jagger]]'s home, [[Stargroves]] as a recording location, but decided it was too expensive.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=73}} They subsequently moved the following month to [[Headley Grange]], a [[country house]] in [[Hampshire]], England, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]] and engineer [[Andy Johns]], with the Stones' [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] assisting. Johns had just worked on engineering ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' and recommended the mobile studio.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=73}} Guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] later recalled: \"We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do.\"{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}  This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band, as they were able to capture spontaneous performances immediately, with some tracks arising from the communal jamming.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Bassist and keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] remembered there was no bar or leisure facilities, but this helped focus the group on the music without being distracted.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=73}}\n\nOnce the basic tracks had been recorded, the band added overdubs at [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] in February. Page then took the multitrack tapes to [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] in Los Angeles for mixing, on Johns' recommendation, with a plan for an April 1971 release.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=89}}{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=91}} However, the band disliked the results, and so after touring through the spring and early summer, Page remixed the whole album in July. The album was delayed again over the choice of cover, whether it should be a [[double album]], with a possible suggestion it could be issued as a set of [[Extended play|EP]]s.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=16, 89}}\n\n==Songs==\n===Side one===\n\"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\" was named after a dog that hung around Headley Grange during recording. The riff was written by Page and Jones, while the a cappella section was influenced by Fleetwood Mac's \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\". Vocalist [[Robert Plant]] wrote the lyrics, and later sang portions of the song during solo concerts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} The guitar solos on the outro were recorded directly into the desk, without using an amplifier.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=79}}\n\n\"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\" was a collaboration with Stewart that came out of a [[jam session|jam]] early in the recording sessions at Headley Grange. Drummer [[John Bonham]] wrote the introduction, which came from jamming around the intro to [[Little Richard]]'s \"Keep A Knockin'\".{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=74}} The track became a live favourite in concert, being performed as the opening number or an encore.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It was released as a promotional single in the US, with stereo and mono mixes on either side of the disc.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=96}}\n\n\"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\" was written by Page on the [[mandolin]], borrowed from Jones. Plant added lyrics inspired by a book he was reading about the [[Scottish Independence Wars]]. The track features a duet between Plant and [[Fairport Convention]]'s [[Sandy Denny]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}{{efn|Plant knew Denny via a mutual friend, Fairport bassist [[Dave Pegg]]. Pegg, Plant and Bonham had played together on the 1960s Birmingham club circuit in the group The Way of Life.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=76}}}} Plant played the role of narrator in the song, describing events, while Denny sang the part of the town crier representing the people.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=76}}\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page's double-neck Gibson guitar, Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood.JPG|thumb|The [[Gibson EDS-1275]] used for live performances of \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\"]]\n\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" was mostly written by Page, and the bulk of the chord sequence was already worked out when recording started at Basing Street Studios. The lyrics were written by Plant at Headley Grange, about a woman who \"took everything without giving anything back\".{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=87}} The final take of the song was recorded at Island Studios after the Headley Grange session. The basic backing track featured Bonham on drums, Jones on [[electric piano]] and Page on acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=87}} The whole group contributed to the arrangement, such as Jones playing recorders on the introduction, and Bonham's distinctive drum entry halfway through the piece.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} Page played the guitar solo using a [[Fender Telecaster]] he had received from [[Jeff Beck]] and been his main guitar on the group's first album and early live shows. He put down three different takes of the solo and picked the best to put on the album.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=89}}\n\nThe song was the standout track on the album and was played on [[FM radio]] stations frequently, but the group resisted all suggestions to release it as a single. It became the centrepiece of the group's live set from 1971 onwards; in order to replicate the changes between acoustic, electric and twelve-string guitar on the studio recording, Page played a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] double neck guitar during the song.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\" was written at Headley Grange and featured Jones playing electric piano.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} Plant wrote the lyrics about dealing with the clash against students and police around drug possession. The title comes from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]''.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=162}} Plant later performed the track on solo tours.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}\n\n\"[[Four Sticks]]\" took its title from Bonham playing the drum pattern that runs throughout the song with four drum sticks. The track was difficult to record compared to the other material on the album, requiring numerous takes.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} It was played live only once by Led Zeppelin,{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} and re-recorded with the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1972.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=86}} It was reworked for Page and Plant's 1994 album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-quarter-mw0000169788|title=No Quarter|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Going to California]]\" is a quiet acoustic number. It was written by Page and Plant about Californian earthquakes, and trying to find the perfect woman. The music was inspired by [[Joni Mitchell]], of whom both Plant and Page were fans.

fans and critics. \"There are two unwritten laws\" about the album, he wrote. The first was that a listener must claim a track from side two, the \"deep cuts with credibility\" side, was his or her favorite, and the second was that one should never say it was their favorite among the band's albums. He blamed this later tendency for why \"rock critics who try too hard always make a case for ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' being Zeppelin's best.\" The band members themselves, he noted, also seemed to prefer performing the songs from side two in their solo shows.<ref name=\"Steven Hyden\">{{cite book|last=Hyden|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Hyden|title=Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock|date=2018|publisher=Dey Street|isbn=9780062657121|pages=21-22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJElDwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nThe album is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] with more than 37 million copies sold as of 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/10998169/Led-Zeppelin-IV-is-this-the-greatest-rock-album-ever-made.html|title=Led Zeppelin IV: is this the greatest rock album ever made?|first=Neil|last=McCormick|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> {{As of|2018}} It is tied for third-highest-certified album in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] at 23&times; Platinum.<ref>{{cite web| title = Top 100 Albums| publisher = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]| url = https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-100-albums| accessdate =22 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, ''Led Zeppelin IV'' was named the 26th-greatest British album in a list by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Q|location=London|page=76|date=June 2000|title=100 Greatest British Albums}}</ref> In 2002, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's [[Chuck Klosterman]] named it the second greatest metal album of all time and said that it was \"the most famous hard-rock album ever recorded\" as well as an album that unintentionally created metal\u2014\"the origin of ''everything'' that sounds, feels, or even tastes vaguely metallic\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman|date=September 2002|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfEjLof28w8C&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=40 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|magazine=Spin|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref> In 2000 it was voted number 42 in [[Colin Larkin]]'s ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]|author=[[Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=3rd|isbn=0-7535-0493-6|page=54}}</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked number 69 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\", maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/billy-joel-the-stranger-2-161561/|year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 23, 2019}}</ref> describing it as \"the peak of Seventies hard rock\".<ref name=\"RS500\"/> It was also named the seventh-best album of the 1970s in a list by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref name=\"Pitchfork70s\">{{cite web|author=Pitchfork Staff|date=23 June 2004|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/10/|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1970s|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|page=10|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> In 2016, Classic Rock magazine ranked ''Led Zeppelin IV'' as the greatest of all Zeppelin albums.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-led-zeppelin-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best|title=Led Zeppelin Albums Ranked From Worst To Best \u2013 The Ultimate Guide|work=loudersound|access-date=30 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Accolades for the fourth Led Zeppelin album\n|-\n!

Thanks. -->The untitled fourth studio album by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]], commonly known as '''''Led Zeppelin IV''''', was released on 8 November 1971 by [[Atlantic Records]]. It was produced by guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and recorded between December 1970 and February 1971, mostly in the country house [[Headley Grange]]. The album is notable for featuring \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", which has been described as the band's [[List of signature songs|signature song]].\n\nThe informal setting at Headley Grange inspired the band, and allowed them to try different arrangements of material and create songs in a variety of styles. After the band's previous album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' received lukewarm reviews from critics, they decided their fourth album would officially be untitled, and would be represented instead by four symbols chosen by each band member, without featuring the name or any other details on the cover.  Unlike the prior two albums, the band was joined by some guest musicians.  Joining [[Robert Plant]] (vocals), [[Jimmy Page]] (guitar), [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass, multi-instrumentalist), and [[John Bonham]] (drums) were [[Fairport Convention]] vocalist [[Sandy Denny]] on \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\", and [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] pianist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] on \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\".  As with prior albums, most of the material was written by the band, though there was one cover song, a hard rock re-interpretation of the [[Memphis Minnie]] blues song \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\".\n\nThe album was a commercial and critical success and is Led Zeppelin's best-selling, shipping over 37 million copies worldwide. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in the US]], while critics have regularly placed it highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:Headley Grange - geograph.org.uk - 29789.jpg|thumb|left|Most of the album was recorded at [[Headley Grange]] in Hampshire.]]\nFollowing the release of ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' in October 1970, the group took a break from live performances to concentrate on recording a follow-up. They turned down all touring offers, including a proposed New Year's Eve gig that would have been broadcast by television. They returned to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a country house in [[Snowdonia]], Wales, to write new material.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=67}}\n\nRecording sessions for the album began at [[Island Records]]' [[Sarm West Studios|Basing Street Studios]], London in December 1970.<ref name=theirtime>{{Cite news| title = Their Time is Gonna Come| newspaper = [[Classic Rock Magazine]]|date=December 2007| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> The group had considered [[Mick Jagger]]'s home, [[Stargroves]] as a recording location, but decided it was too expensive.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=73}} They subsequently moved the following month to [[Headley Grange]], a [[country house]] in [[Hampshire]], England, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]] and engineer [[Andy Johns]], with the Stones' [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] assisting. Johns had just worked on engineering ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' and recommended the mobile studio.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=73}} Guitarist and producer [[Jimmy Page]] later recalled: \"We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do.\"{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}}  This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band, as they were able to capture spontaneous performances immediately, with some tracks arising from the communal jamming.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=16}} Bassist and keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] remembered there was no bar or leisure facilities, but this helped focus the group on the music without being distracted.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=73}}\n\nOnce the basic tracks had been recorded, the band added overdubs at [[Sarm West Studios|Island Studios]] in February. Page then took the multitrack tapes to [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] in Los Angeles for mixing, on Johns' recommendation, with a plan for an April 1971 release.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=89}}{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=91}} However, the band disliked the results, and so after touring through the spring and early summer, Page remixed the whole album in July. The album was delayed again over the choice of cover, whether it should be a [[double album]], with a possible suggestion it could be issued as a set of [[Extended play|EP]]s.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|pp=16, 89}}\n\n==Songs==\n===Side one===\n\"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\" was named after a dog that hung around Headley Grange during recording. The riff was written by Page and Jones, while the a cappella section was influenced by Fleetwood Mac's \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\". Vocalist [[Robert Plant]] wrote the lyrics, and later sang portions of the song during solo concerts.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} The guitar solos on the outro were recorded directly into the desk, without using an amplifier.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=79}}\n\n\"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\" was a collaboration with Stewart that came out of a [[jam session|jam]] early in the recording sessions at Headley Grange. Drummer [[John Bonham]] wrote the introduction, which came from jamming around the intro to [[Little Richard]]'s \"Keep A Knockin'\".{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=74}} The track became a live favourite in concert, being performed as the opening number or an encore.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} It was released as a promotional single in the US, with stereo and mono mixes on either side of the disc.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=96}}\n\n\"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\" was written by Page on the [[mandolin]], borrowed from Jones. Plant added lyrics inspired by a book he was reading about the [[Scottish Independence Wars]]. The track features a duet between Plant and [[Fairport Convention]]'s [[Sandy Denny]].{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}{{efn|Plant knew Denny via a mutual friend, Fairport bassist [[Dave Pegg]]. Pegg, Plant and Bonham had played together on the 1960s Birmingham club circuit in the group The Way of Life.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=76}}}} Plant played the role of narrator in the song, describing events, while Denny sang the part of the town crier representing the people.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=76}}\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page's double-neck Gibson guitar, Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood.JPG|thumb|The [[Gibson EDS-1275]] used for live performances of \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\"]]\n\"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" was mostly written by Page, and the bulk of the chord sequence was already worked out when recording started at Basing Street Studios. The lyrics were written by Plant at Headley Grange, about a woman who \"took everything without giving anything back\".{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=87}} The final take of the song was recorded at Island Studios after the Headley Grange session. The basic backing track featured Bonham on drums, Jones on [[electric piano]] and Page on acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=87}} The whole group contributed to the arrangement, such as Jones playing recorders on the introduction, and Bonham's distinctive drum entry halfway through the piece.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} Page played the guitar solo using a [[Fender Telecaster]] he had received from [[Jeff Beck]] and been his main guitar on the group's first album and early live shows. He put down three different takes of the solo and picked the best to put on the album.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=89}}\n\nThe song was the standout track on the album and was played on [[FM radio]] stations frequently, but the group resisted all suggestions to release it as a single. It became the centrepiece of the group's live set from 1971 onwards; in order to replicate the changes between acoustic, electric and twelve-string guitar on the studio recording, Page played a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] double neck guitar during the song.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}\n\n===Side two===\n\"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\" was written at Headley Grange and featured Jones playing electric piano.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} Plant wrote the lyrics about dealing with the clash against students and police around drug possession. The title comes from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]''.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=162}} Plant later performed the track on solo tours.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}\n\n\"[[Four Sticks]]\" took its title from Bonham playing the drum pattern that runs throughout the song with four drum sticks. The track was difficult to record compared to the other material on the album, requiring numerous takes.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} It was played live only once by Led Zeppelin,{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} and re-recorded with the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1972.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=86}} It was reworked for Page and Plant's 1994 album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/no-quarter-mw0000169788|title=No Quarter|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Going to California]]\" is a quiet acoustic number. It was written by Page and Plant about Californian earthquakes, and trying to find the perfect woman. The music was inspired by [[Joni Mitchell]], of whom both Plant and Page were fans. The track was originally titled \"Guide To California\"; the final title comes from the trip to Los Angeles to mix the album.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=78}}\n\n\"[[When the Levee Breaks#Led Zeppelin version|When the Levee Breaks]]\" comes from a blues song recorded by [[Memphis Minnie]] and [[Kansas Joe McCoy]] in 1929. The track opens with Bonham's heavy unaccompanied drumming, which was recorded in the lobby of Headley Grange using two [[Beyerdynamic]] M 160 microphones which were hung up a flight of stairs; output from these were passed to a [[limiter]]. A [[Binson|Binson Echorec]], a [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] [[effects unit]], was also used.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/andy-johns-on-the-secrets-behind-the-led-zeppelin-iv-sessions-586533 | title =Andy Johns on the secrets behind the Led Zeppelin IV sessions | last =Welch | first =Chris | date =31 October 2013 | website = MusicRadar | publisher = Future Publishing | access-date = 28 October 2018}}</ref> Page recalled he had tried to record the track at early sessions, but it had sounded flat. The unusual locations around the lobby gave the ideal ambience for the drum sound.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=84}} This introduction was later extensively sampled for [[hip hop]] music in the 1980s.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}} Page and Plant played the song on their 1995 tour promoting ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=103}}\n\n===Other songs===\nThree other songs from the sessions, \"[[Down by the Seaside]]\", \"[[Night Flight (song)|Night Flight]]\" and \"[[Boogie with Stu]]\" (featuring Stewart on piano), were included four years later on the double album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''. An early version of \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" was also recorded at the sessions.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=52}}\n\n==Title==<!-- Sources and consensus have determined that the album was released WITHOUT A TITLE.

Thanks. -->\n[[File:Led Zeppelin (untitled).jpg|thumb|The original vinyl record label with the four hand-drawn symbols]] \nAfter the lukewarm, if not confused and sometimes dismissive, critical reaction ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' had received in late 1970, Page decided that the next Led Zeppelin album would not have a title, but would instead feature four hand-drawn symbols on the inner sleeve and record label, each one chosen by the band member it represents.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} The record company were strongly against the idea, but the group stood their ground and refused to hand over the master tapes until their decision had been agreed to.{{sfn|Lewis|2010|p=93}}\n\nPage has also stated that the decision to release the album without any written information on the album sleeve was contrary to strong advice given to him by a press agent, who said that after a year's absence from both records and touring, the move would be akin to \"professional suicide\".<ref name = Schulps /> Page thought, \"We just happened to have a lot of faith in what we were doing.\"<ref name = Schulps /> He recalled the record company were insisting that a title had to be on the album, but held his ground, as he felt it would be an answer to critics who could not review one Led Zeppelin album without point of reference to earlier ones.<ref name=jackson2>{{cite news|first=James|last=Jackson|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6979690.ece|title=Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin IV, the band's peak and their reunion|work=[[The Times]]|date=8 January 2010|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nReleasing the album without an official title has made it difficult to consistently identify. While most commonly called ''Led Zeppelin IV'', Atlantic Records catalogues have used the names ''Four Symbols'' and ''The Fourth Album''.

Initially thinking of a single symbol, he then decided there could be four, with each member of the band choosing his own.<ref name = Schulps /> He designed his own symbol{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} and has never publicly disclosed any reasoning behind it.

It is intended to symbolise a person who possesses both confidence and competence.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} Bonham's symbol, the three interlocking [[Borromean rings|(Borromean) rings]], was picked by the drummer from the same book. It represents the triad of mother, father and child, but, inverted, it also happens to be the logo for [[Ballantine Brewery|Ballantine]] beer.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} Plant's symbol of a feather within a circle was his own design, being based on the sign of the supposed [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] civilisation.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=51}} A fifth, smaller symbol chosen by guest vocalist [[Sandy Denny]] represents her contribution to \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\"; the figure, composed of three equilateral triangles, appears on the inner sleeve of the LP, serving as an [[asterisk]].<ref name=sleeve/>\n\n[[File:Threefold-Symbol.png|150px|thumb|left|[[Sandy Denny]]'s symbol of three downward-pointing [[equilateral triangle]]s.]]\n\nDuring Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour Winter 1971|tour of the United Kingdom]] in winter 1971 shortly after the album's release, the symbols could be seen on the group's stage equipment; Page's on one of his amplifiers, Bonham's on his [[bass drum]] head, Jones' on a covering for his [[Rhodes piano]], and Plant's on the side of a PA cabinet.

The first was that a listener must claim a track from side two, the \"deep cuts with credibility\" side, was his or her favorite, and the second was that one should never say it was their favorite among the band's albums. He blamed this later tendency for why \"rock critics who try too hard always make a case for ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' being Zeppelin's best.\" The band members themselves, he noted, also seemed to prefer performing the songs from side two in their solo shows.<ref name=\"Steven Hyden\">{{cite book|last=Hyden|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Hyden|title=Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock|date=2018|publisher=Dey Street|isbn=9780062657121|pages=21-22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJElDwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nThe album is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] with more than 37 million copies sold as of 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/10998169/Led-Zeppelin-IV-is-this-the-greatest-rock-album-ever-made.html|title=Led Zeppelin IV: is this the greatest rock album ever made?|first=Neil|last=McCormick|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> {{As of|2018}} It is tied for third-highest-certified album in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] at 23&times; Platinum.<ref>{{cite web| title = Top 100 Albums| publisher = [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]| url = https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-100-albums| accessdate =22 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, ''Led Zeppelin IV'' was named the 26th-greatest British album in a list by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Q|location=London|page=76|date=June 2000|title=100 Greatest British Albums}}</ref> In 2002, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's [[Chuck Klosterman]] named it the second greatest metal album of all time and said that it was \"the most famous hard-rock album ever recorded\" as well as an album that unintentionally created metal\u2014\"the origin of ''everything'' that sounds, feels, or even tastes vaguely metallic\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman|date=September 2002|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfEjLof28w8C&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=40 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|magazine=Spin|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref> In 2000 it was voted number 42 in [[Colin Larkin]]'s ''[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[All Time Top 1000 Albums]]|author=[[Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=3rd|isbn=0-7535-0493-6|page=54}}</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked number 69 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\", maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/billy-joel-the-stranger-2-161561/|year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 23, 2019}}</ref> describing it as \"the peak of Seventies hard rock\".<ref name=\"RS500\"/> It was also named the seventh-best album of the 1970s in a list by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref name=\"Pitchfork70s\">{{cite web|author=Pitchfork Staff|date=23 June 2004|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/10/|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1970s|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|page=10|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> In 2016, Classic Rock magazine ranked ''Led Zeppelin IV'' as the greatest of all Zeppelin albums.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-led-zeppelin-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best|title=Led Zeppelin Albums Ranked From Worst To Best \u2013 The Ultimate Guide|work=loudersound|access-date=30 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Accolades for the fourth Led Zeppelin album\n|-\n!

It defended [[Northern Ireland]]. The regiment continued to serve until 1943 when it was moved to the Middle East and served in the [[North African Campaign]] before being disbanded.{{Clarify|reason=What is suspended animation in a military context|date=April 2020}} When the [[Territorial Army (UK)|TA]] was reformed the next year, the regiment was reformed yet disbanded in 1955 following the concurrently disbandment of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] (AA Command).\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Territorial Army was rapidly expanded following the Munich Crisis, particularly the Anti-Aircraft (AA) branch of the Royal Artillery (RA). The '''102nd Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA''' was one of these many new units formed in the spring of 1939.<ref>Brayley, 'North West Europe', p. 21</ref><ref name=\":0\">Dr Leo Niehorster, [http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_commands/aa-03.html 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, Anti-Aircraft Command 3 September 1939] at [http://niehorster.org/index.htm World War II Armed Forces - Orders of Battle and Organisations]</ref><ref name=\":2\">Litchfield, p. 313</ref> By September 1939 the regiment was organised as follows;<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>[http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=6697&page=1 British Anti-Aircraft Command, TA on 3 September 1939] at the [http://www.patriotfiles.com/ Patriot Files]</ref>\n\n* Regimental Headquarters & Headquarters Battery, [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]]\n* 314th AA Battery, [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]]\n* 315th AA Battery, [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]]\n* 316th AA Battery, [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]]\n*175th LAA Battery, [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]] (joining on mobilisation)\n*175th LAA Battery, [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]] (joining on mobilisation)\n\nFollowing formation, the regiment was assigned to [[Northern Ireland District]] and designated as a [[Supplementary Reserve (United Kingdom)|Supplementary Reserve]] (SR) regiment due to traditions of no TA units being based in [[Northern Ireland]]. Throughout the entire AA branch of the RA, there were 850 [[Heavy anti-aircraft|HAA]] and 510 LAA guns based throughout the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\">General Sir Federick Pile's Despatch</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nBefore mobilisation leading up to the beginning of [[Second World War]], the [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] (AA Command) was divided into seven divisions of varying brigades and several AA and searchlights in each. One of these divisions was the [[3rd Anti-Aircraft Division|3rd AA Division]] which was tasked with defending both Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]]. During this period there was one fighter squadron detached from [[RAF Fighter Command]] and two other HAA units covering the entire country, of which only one of these (8th (Belfast)) was fully organised and equipped.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Basil Collier, [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-4.html Chapter IV 'The Eve of the War']</ref>\n\n====Mobilisation====\nIn June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.\n\nWhen General Sir Frederick Pyle took command of AA Command on 28 July 1939, the command had a severe shortage of equipment, especially in the HAA section of the AA branch. On the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, there were a total of just 695 covering the entire country, many of which were only on loan from the [[Royal Navy]]. The situation was worse for the fact that AA Command's establishment had 2,232 units, yet not even half of the guns were available or produced.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Phoney War====\nDuring the early parts of the [[Phoney War]], AA Command was lucky for there were very little to no air attacks over [[Great Britain]], which allowed them to fix their structure, equipment shortages, and manpower issues. One of the first issues that were solved was the manpower, which was being steadily helped by the introduction of conscription in mid-1939, of which 20,000 were allocated to AA Command. During this period, many of the 'militia'<ref group=\"Notes\">The term 'Conscription' or 'Draft' wasn't used, as it seemed a scary word, therefore these conscripts were designated as \"Militia\" or \"Militiamen\".</ref> were either medically unfit or in terrible condition due to many of the better militia going to overseas posts and deployments.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn 1 June 1940 those AA regiments like the 102nd equipped with [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] or the newer [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch guns]] were termed [[Heavy anti-aircraft|Heavy Anti-Aircraft]] (HAA) to distinguish them from the new [[Light Anti-Aircraft]] (LAA) units being formed. Thus, the regiment was renamed as the '''102nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA)'''. During this period, the commander of AA Command, General Sir Frederick Pile, oversaw a massive expansion of the AA branch due to the lack of AA defences during the failed [[Norwegian Campaign]] and subsequent [[Battle of France]]. The general felt that if the AA defences and [[RAF Fighter Command]] could work together they could win the air war, thus preventing an invasion of [[Operation Sea Lion]]. As a result of this AA Command was reorganised and formed five new AA divisions and 3 AA Corps.

This new division was formed in accordance with the reorganisation of [[RAF Fighter Command]] which covered these same areas, therefore allowing the two groups to work more efficiently together.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Battle of Britain====\nOn 20 July 1940 [[No. 245 Squadron RAF]] was moved to [[RAF Aldergrove]] in central [[Northern Ireland]] where they were tasked with providing support to the AA and Searchlight (S/L) units based in the area. By 11 September 1940 more forces were moved to [[Northern Ireland]] due to the threat of a flank invasion through the [[Republic of Ireland]] which was being somewhat tempted by [[Nazi Germany]]. During this period the large TA divisions, [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division|53rd (Welsh) Infantry]] and [[61st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|61st Infantry Division]] were based along with the independent [[148th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|148th Infantry Brigade]] were tasked with defending the NI coast and border in addition to helping the AA defences.<ref>Basil Collier, the [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/img/DefenseOfUK-34.jpg Defence of the United Kingdom, Map #17, Disposition of Home Forces 11 September 1940]</ref><ref>Basil Collier, [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-14.html Chapter XIV 'The Invasion Risk: The Crisis and After (September, 1940-June, 1941)]</ref><ref>[http://ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page7.html N Ireland District at Royal Artillery 1939-45], [https://web.archive.org/web/20041216215020/http://ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/home/page7.html Archived] on 16 December 2004, Retrieved 7 January 2020</ref> By November 1940, the following AA units were under the command of [[Northern Ireland District]];<ref>[http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=6697&page=1 British Anti-Aircraft Command, TA on 3 September 1939] at the [http://www.patriotfiles.com Patriot Files]</ref><ref>Litchfield, pp. 310-3</ref>\n\n* Signals Troop, 8th AA Divisional Signals, [[Royal Corps of Signals]] (detached from HQ)\n* [[3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery|3rd (Ulster) S/L, RA]] (SR), Belfast (covering Belfast and [[County Armagh]])\n* [[8th (Belfast) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|8th (Belfast) HAA, RA]] (SR), Belfast (covering Belfast and [[County Down]])\n* [[9th (Londonderry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|9th (Londonderry) HAA, RA]] (SR), Londonderry (covering Londonderry, [[County Londonderry]], and [[County Antrim]])\n* 102nd HAA, RA (TA), [[Antrim, Ireland|Antrim]] (covering [[County Antrim]])\n\nBy 13 November 1940 the AA defences in [[Northern Ireland]] were again expanded, with the new [[No. 82 Group RAF]] being formed from the two (soon to be many new squadrons and sections).<ref>Basil Collier, Defence of the United Kingdom, [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-16.html Chapter XVI 'The Night Offensive Against London (7 September-13 November, 1940)']</ref> (See: [[Joint Helicopter Command Flying Station Aldergrove#Second World War]])\n\nThroughout 1941 [[Northern Ireland]] was still very unprepared, this was evident that still only 22 AA guns were based throughout the country just as the [[Luftwaffe]] started bombing Belfast later that year.<ref>BBC, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2k9d2p/revision/1 Northern Ireland's role in World War Two]</ref>\n\n====Middle East====\nIn May 1943 the regiment was sent to [[North Africa]] where it joined [[Middle East Force|Middle East Forces]] in the HAA role of defending [[Northern Egypt]].

It defended [[Northern Ireland]]. The regiment continued to serve until 1943 when it was moved to the Middle East and served in the [[North African Campaign]] before being disbanded.{{Clarify|reason=What is suspended animation in a military context|date=April 2020}} When the [[Territorial Army (UK)|TA]] was reformed the next year, the regiment was reformed yet disbanded in 1955 following the concurrently disbandment of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] (AA Command).\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Territorial Army was rapidly expanded following the Munich Crisis, particularly the Anti-Aircraft (AA) branch of the Royal Artillery (RA).

Throughout the entire AA branch of the RA, there were 850 [[Heavy anti-aircraft|HAA]] and 510 LAA guns based throughout the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\">General Sir Federick Pile's Despatch</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nBefore mobilisation leading up to the beginning of [[Second World War]], the [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] (AA Command) was divided into seven divisions of varying brigades and several AA and searchlights in each. One of these divisions was the [[3rd Anti-Aircraft Division|3rd AA Division]] which was tasked with defending both Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]]. During this period there was one fighter squadron detached from [[RAF Fighter Command]] and two other HAA units covering the entire country, of which only one of these (8th (Belfast)) was fully organised and equipped.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>Basil Collier, [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-4.html Chapter IV 'The Eve of the War']</ref>\n\n====Mobilisation====\nIn June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.\n\nWhen General Sir Frederick Pyle took command of AA Command on 28 July 1939, the command had a severe shortage of equipment, especially in the HAA section of the AA branch. On the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, there were a total of just 695 covering the entire country, many of which were only on loan from the [[Royal Navy]]. The situation was worse for the fact that AA Command's establishment had 2,232 units, yet not even half of the guns were available or produced.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Phoney War====\nDuring the early parts of the [[Phoney War]], AA Command was lucky for there were very little to no air attacks over [[Great Britain]], which allowed them to fix their structure, equipment shortages, and manpower issues. One of the first issues that were solved was the manpower, which was being steadily helped by the introduction of conscription in mid-1939, of which 20,000 were allocated to AA Command. During this period, many of the 'militia'<ref group=\"Notes\">The term 'Conscription' or 'Draft' wasn't used, as it seemed a scary word, therefore these conscripts were designated as \"Militia\" or \"Militiamen\".</ref> were either medically unfit or in terrible condition due to many of the better militia going to overseas posts and deployments.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn 1 June 1940 those AA regiments like the 102nd equipped with [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] or the newer [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|3.7-inch guns]] were termed [[Heavy anti-aircraft|Heavy Anti-Aircraft]] (HAA) to distinguish them from the new [[Light Anti-Aircraft]] (LAA) units being formed. Thus, the regiment was renamed as the '''102nd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (TA)'''. During this period, the commander of AA Command, General Sir Frederick Pile, oversaw a massive expansion of the AA branch due to the lack of AA defences during the failed [[Norwegian Campaign]] and subsequent [[Battle of France]]. The general felt that if the AA defences and [[RAF Fighter Command]] could work together they could win the air war, thus preventing an invasion of [[Operation Sea Lion]]. As a result of this AA Command was reorganised and formed five new AA divisions and 3 AA Corps.
