This was done in celebration of the successful collection of more than 125,000 signatures, forcing the government to hold a [[2016 Swiss referendums#Basic income referendum|referendum]] in 2016 on whether or not to incorporate the concept of basic income in the federal constitution. The measure did not pass, with 76.9% voting against changing the federal constitution to support basic income.<ref name=\"Vorlage Nr. 601\">{{cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20160605/det601.html|title=Vorlage Nr. 601 \u2013 Vorl\u00e4ufige amtliche Endergebnisse|work=admin.ch|language=de-CH|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>]]\n\n'''Basic income''', also called '''universal basic income''' ('''UBI'''), '''citizen's income''', '''citizen's basic income''', '''basic income guarantee''', '''basic living stipend''', '''guaranteed annual income''', or '''universal [[demogrant]]''', is a governmental public program for a periodic payment delivered to all on an individual basis without means test or work requirement.<ref name=\"basicincome.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://basicincome.org/|title=BIEN {{!}} Basic Income Earth Network|website=BIEN|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref> The incomes would be:\n* '''Unconditional''': A basic income would vary with age, but with no other conditions.

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]) is sometimes called a full basic income while if it is less than that amount, it is sometimes called partial. A welfare system with some characteristics similar to those of a basic income is a [[negative income tax]] in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labour income. Some welfare systems are sometimes regarded as steps on the way to a basic income, but because they have conditionalities attached they are not basic incomes. If they raise household incomes to specified minima they are called [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=S\u00e1nchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|volume=11|issue=2\u20133|date=2011|page=1|doi=10.1177/1468018111421297}}</ref>\n\nSeveral political discussions are related to the basic income debate. Examples include the debates regarding robotization, [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), and the future of work. A key issue in these debates is whether robotization and AI will significantly reduce the number of available jobs, additionally, whether a basic income would be sufficient enough to eliminate such problems. \n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Basic income around the world}}\nThe idea of a state-run basic Income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' depicted a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.<ref>Bryce Covert, \"What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income \u2013 and its limitations\", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (10 / 17 September 2018), p. 33.</ref> In the late 18th century, [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system that guaranteed all citizens a certain income. Nineteenth-century debate on basic income was limited, but during the early part of the 20th century a basic income called a \"state bonus\" was widely discussed, and in 1946 the United Kingdom implemented unconditional family allowances for the second and subsequent children of every family. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onward, the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that have some similarities to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil. From 2008 onward, several experiments with basic income and related systems have taken place.\n\nGovernments can contribute to individual and household income maintenance strategies in three ways:\n \n# The government can establish a minimum income guarantee and not allow income to fall below levels set for various household types, maintaining these levels by paying [[means-tested benefit]]s.\n# [[Social insurance]] can pay benefits in the case of sickness, unemployment, or old age, on the basis of contributions paid\n#Universal unconditional payments, such as the United Kingdom's Child Benefit for children.<ref>{{cite book|title=How social security works|last=Spicker|first=Paul|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=9781447342854|doi = 10.2307/j.ctt1t896gv}}</ref>\n\nIn more detail:\n\n# A means-tested benefit that raises a household's income to a guaranteed minimum level is unlike a basic income in that income delivered under a system of guaranteed minimum income is reduced proportionally as other sources of income increase whereas income received from a basic income is constant regardless of other sources of income. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492\u20131540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents \"not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity\". However, Vives also argued that to qualify for poor relief the recipient must \"deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work\".<ref>[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ \"History of Basic Income\"]. Basic Income Earth Network.</ref>\n# The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743\u20131794). After playing a prominent role in the [[French Revolution]], he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d\u2019un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l\u2019esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] Thomas Paine (1737\u20131809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet's death.\n# The first social movement for Basic Income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], Dennis Milner (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas]].\n* Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.\n* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled \"Scheme for a State Bonus\" (1918) that argued for the \"introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom\". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.\n* C. H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system he called [[social credit]], a combination of monetary reform and basic income.\n\nIn 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]] led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]] developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance, means-tested benefits and unconditional allowances for children. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.<ref name=sloman-2015>{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition= 1st publ.}}</ref> Her son Brandon Rhys Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982 and soon after that in 1984 the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizensincome.org/|title=Citizen's Income \u2013 An unconditional, nonwithdrawable income paid to every individual as a right of citizenship.|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with the [[negative income tax]]. Then President [[Richard Nixon]] once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the Congress, but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens, thus:<ref name=Nixon_UBI>{{cite web|title=American President: Richard Milhous Nixon: Domestic Affairs|work=MillerCenter.org|publisher=Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|accessdate=28 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407202356/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|archive-date=7 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|Nixon proposed more ambitious programs than he enacted, including the National Health Insurance Partnership Program, which promoted health maintenance organizations (HMOs). He also proposed a massive overhaul of federal welfare programs. The centerpiece of Nixon's welfare reform was the replacement of much of the welfare system with a negative income tax, a favorite proposal of conservative economist Milton Friedman. The purpose of the negative income tax was to provide both a safety net for the poor and a financial incentive for welfare recipients to work.\n}}In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years.<ref name=\"basicincome.org\" /> From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest. In West Germany, groups of unemployed people took a stance for the reform.<ref name=\"archiv-grundeinkommen.de\">Blaschke, Ronald (January 2010). [http://www.archiv-grundeinkommen.de/blaschke/20100127-The-Basic-Income-debate-in-Germany.pdf \"The basic income debate in Germany and some basic reflections\"].</ref>\n\nFrom 2010 onwards, Basic Income again became an active topic in many countries. Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives\u2014including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. For example, experiments in Canada, Finland, India and Namibia have received international media attention. The [[2016 Swiss referendums#Basic income referendum|first and only national referendum about basic income]] was held in Switzerland in 2016. The result was a rejection of the basic income proposal by a vote of 76.9% to 23.1%.\n\n== Perspectives in the basic income debate ==\n=== Automation ===\n{{main|Automation}}\n[[File:Andrew Yang by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Andrew Yang holding a microphone while making a speech|Entrepreneur and [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic candidate]] [[Andrew Yang]] has advocated for a basic income to counter [[Technological unemployment|job displacement through automation]]. His basic income policy, the [[Freedom Dividend]], aims to give every American adult $1,000 a month.]]\nThe debates about basic income and automation are closely linked. For example, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] argues that the increase in automation creates a greater need for basic income. Concerns about automation have prompted many in the high-technology industry to argue for basic income as an implication of their business models. U.S. presidential candidate and non-profit founder [[Andrew Yang]] has stated that automation caused the loss of 4 million manufacturing jobs in the Midwest and resulted in the election of [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/andrew-yangs-presidential-bid-is-so-very-21st-century/|title=Andrew Yang's Presidential Bid Is So Very 21st Century|last=Simon|first=Matt|date=2019-04-01|work=Wired|access-date=2019-08-17|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The CEO of [[Tesla, Inc.]] and [[SpaceX]], [[Elon Musk]], came out in support of basic income and Yang due to automation and AI.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/elon-musk-endorses-andrew-yang-president.html|title=SpaceX's Elon Musk Endorses Democratic Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang|author=Mike Wall |date=2019-08-13|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n\nMany technologists believe that automation, among other things, is creating [[technological unemployment]]. Journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] first highlighted the turn of the \"tech elite\" to these ideas with an article in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine which cited [[Marc Andreessen]], [[Sam Altman]], [[Peter Diamandis]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|date=6 January 2015|work=Vice}}</ref><ref name=\"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\">{{Cite report|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf |title=Economic Report of the President|date=February 2016|page=244|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|date=6 January 2015|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|work=Vice}}</ref> Some studies about automation and jobs validate these concerns. In a report to the Congress, the White House estimated that a worker earning less than $20 an hour in 2010 would eventually lose their job to a machine with 83% probability. Even workers earning as much as $40 an hour faced a probability of 31%.<ref name=\"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\" /> With a rising [[unemployment]] rate, poor communities would become more impoverished worldwide. Proponents of universal basic income argue that it could solve many world problems like high work stress and could create more opportunities and efficient and effective work. In a study in Dauphin, Manitoba, only 13% of labor decreased from a much higher expected number.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Forget |first=Evelyn L. |title=The Town With No Poverty: The Health Effects of a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income Field Experiment |journal=Canadian Public Policy |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=283\u2013305 |doi=10.3138/cpp.37.3.283}}</ref> In a study in several Indian villages, basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.<ref>{{cite web |first=Abhishek |last=Roy |publisher=Seven Pillars Institute |accessdate=16 July 2017 |title=Part 2 of SPI's Universal Basic Income Series |url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/universal-basic-income-empirical-studies/}}</ref>\n\nBesides technological unemployment, some tech-industry experts worry that automation would destabilize the labor market or increase [[economic inequality]]. One example is [[Chris Hughes]], co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years and while it has not permanently reduced the employment rate, it has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vall\u00e9e]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility as it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vall\u00e9e examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that paid labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead it increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|via=Google Docs|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Bad behavior ===\nCriticism of a basic income includes the argument that some recipients would spend a basic income on alcohol and other drugs.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\"/><ref>Koga, Kenya. \"Pennies From Heaven.\" Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67\u201368.

For him, basic income was part of a larger structural change of the economic system towards a more green and sustainable system.\n\n=== Different ideological arguments ===\n* Georgist views: [[geolibertarian]]s seek to synthesize propertarian libertarianism and a geoist (or [[Georgist]]) philosophy of [[land (economics)|land]] as unowned commons or equally owned by all people, citing the [[classical economics|classical economic]] distinction between unimproved land and private property. The rental value of land is produced by the labors of the community and, as such, rightly belongs to the community at large and not solely to the landholder. A [[land value tax]] (LVT) is levied as an annual fee for exclusive access to a section of earth which is collected and redistributed to the community either through [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s, such as public security or a court system, or in the form of a basic guaranteed income called a [[citizen's dividend]]. Geolibertarians view the LVT as a [[single tax]] to replace all other methods of taxation which are deemed unjust violations of the [[non-aggression principle]].\n* Conservative views: support for basic income has been expressed by several people associated with conservative political views. While adherents of such views generally favor minimization or abolition of the public provision of [[welfare]] services, some have cited basic income as a viable strategy to reduce the amount of bureaucratic administration that is prevalent in many contemporary welfare systems. Others have contended that it could also act as a form of compensation for [[fiat currency]] inflation.<ref name=\"perspectives\">{{cite web |url = http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/01/27/a-universal-basic-income-conservative-progressive-and-libertarian-perspectives-part-3-of-a-series/ |title = A Universal Basic Income: Conservative, Progressive, and Libertarian Perspectives |publisher = [[EconoMonitor]] |date = 27 January 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Dolan, Ed }}</ref><ref name=\"BI\">{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-2013-5 |title = There's A Way To Give Everyone In America An Income That Conservatives And Liberals Can Both Love |work = [[Business Insider]] |date = 13 May 2013 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Weisenthal, Joe }}</ref><ref name=\"conservative\">{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/ |title = The Conservative Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income |work = [[The Atlantic]] |date = 6 August 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Gordon, Noah }}</ref>\n* Feminist views: [[feminist]] views on basic income are loosely divided into two opposing views.

The degree of any disincentive to employment because of basic income would likely depend on how generous the basic income was.\n\nSome studies have looked at employment levels during the experiments with basic income and negative income tax and similar systems. In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher. Participants in these experiments knew that the experiment was limited in time.<ref name=\"cangov94\" />\n\nIn the [[Mincome]] experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba also in the 1970s, there were also slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.<ref>{{cite web |last = Belik |first = Vivian |url = http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100 |title = A Town Without Poverty?

The researchers\u2014Damon Jones from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and [[Ioana Marinescu]] from the University of Pennsylvania School of Public Policy and Practice\u2014maintain that although there is a small decrease in work by recipients due to reasons like those in the Manitoba experiment, there has been a 17 percent increase in part-time jobs. The authors theorize that employment remained steady, because the extra income that let people buy more also increased demand for service jobs. This finding is consistent with the economic data of the time. No effect was seen when it came to jobs in manufacturing, which produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment. To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses the dividend to help with car payments can cut back on hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. Because more people are spending more, the store must replace the worker who started working less. Meanwhile, distribution of the dividend doesn't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop |publisher=Quartz|website=qz.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working\u2014but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work and not dissuade people out of the work force.\n\nAnother study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]].

Money is like an access ticket to use those resources, and so to make people equally free to do what they want with world assets, the government should give each individual as many such access tickets as possible\u2014that is, the highest sustainable basic income.\n\nKarl Widerquist and others have proposed a theory of freedom in which basic income is needed to protect the power to refuse work<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137274724|title=Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income \u2013 A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No |author= K. Widerquist  |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> which can be summarized as follows. If the resources necessary to an individual's survival are controlled by another group, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. Today, resources necessary for the production of food, shelter and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not.\n\nTherefore, the argument goes that the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\" /> Under this argument, personal, political and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no. In this view, basic income provides an economic freedom which\u2014combined with political freedom, freedom of belief and personal freedom\u2014establish each individual's status as a free person.\n\n=== Gender equality ===\nThe Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]] has argued that basic income is a way to promote [[gender equality]].<ref name=\"mckay1\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Ailsa |year=2005 |title= The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens Basic Income |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= 9781134287185 |author-link=Ailsa McKay }}</ref> She noted in 2001 that \"social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market\" and that \"the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights\".<ref name=\"mckay1\">{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97\u2013118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}</ref>\n\nWomen perform the majority of unpaid care work around the world.

This program is also like Basic Income except that is restricted to children.\n*[[Conditional cash transfer]], a regular payment given to families, but only to the poor and usually dependent on basic conditions such as sending their children to school or having them vaccinated. Programs include [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil and a similar program in M\u00e9xico.\n*[[Guaranteed minimum income]] differs despite the name from a Basic Income because it is restricted to those in search of work. Example programs are [[unemployment benefits]] in the UK and the [[revenu de solidarit\u00e9 active]] in France.\n\n[[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] is a large social welfare program in Brazil that provides money to many poor families in the country. The system is related to basic income, but has more conditions, like asking the recipients to keep their children in school until graduation. Brazilian Senator [[Eduardo Suplicy]] championed a law that ultimately passed in 2004 that declared Bolsa Fam\u00edlia a first step towards a national basic income. However, the program has not yet been expanded in that direction.\n\n[[Rythu Bandhu scheme]], is a welfare scheme started on 10 May 2018 aimed towards helping farmers that is being implemented by the state of [[Telangana]] in India where each farmland owner gets a fixed amount of money \u20b94000 per acre twice a year for [[Rabi crop|rabi]] and [[Kharif crop|kharif]] harvests.

Stout|Lynn Stout]] and her co-authors Tamara Belinfanti and Sergio Gramitto in their book ''Citizen Capitalism: How A Universal Fund Can Provide Influence and Income to All'' which was published in 2019. In the book, Stout and her co-authors propose the building of a not-for-profit universal fund composed of shares donated by corporations and philanthropic individuals in which every American would receive one share. These shares could not be sold, bequeathed, donated, or borrowed against, but each \"citizen shareholder\" would receive an even portion of the net dividends paid out by shares in the fund, therefore contributing to the amelioration of income inequality. Each shareholder would also receive additional influence in the form of a vote (corresponding to their shares in the fund), providing in theory for a significantly expanded degree of citizen engagement in the role that public corporations play in American society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizencapitalism.org/|title=Citizen Capitalism|website=Citizen Capitalism|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Basic income in crypto currencies and as part of social media apps ===\nNimses is a concept that offers universal basic income to every member of its system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://futurism.com/what-will-the-currency-of-a-workless-cashless-future-be|title=What Will the Currency of a Workless, Cashless Future Be?|website=Futurism|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> The idea of Nimses consists of [[time-based currency]] called Nim (1 nim = 1 minute of life).

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]) is sometimes called a full basic income while if it is less than that amount, it is sometimes called partial. A welfare system with some characteristics similar to those of a basic income is a [[negative income tax]] in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labour income. Some welfare systems are sometimes regarded as steps on the way to a basic income, but because they have conditionalities attached they are not basic incomes. If they raise household incomes to specified minima they are called [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=S\u00e1nchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|volume=11|issue=2\u20133|date=2011|page=1|doi=10.1177/1468018111421297}}</ref>\n\nSeveral political discussions are related to the basic income debate. Examples include the debates regarding robotization, [[artificial intelligence]] (AI), and the future of work. A key issue in these debates is whether robotization and AI will significantly reduce the number of available jobs, additionally, whether a basic income would be sufficient enough to eliminate such problems. \n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Basic income around the world}}\nThe idea of a state-run basic Income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' depicted a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.<ref>Bryce Covert, \"What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income \u2013 and its limitations\", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (10 / 17 September 2018), p. 33.</ref> In the late 18th century, [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system that guaranteed all citizens a certain income. Nineteenth-century debate on basic income was limited, but during the early part of the 20th century a basic income called a \"state bonus\" was widely discussed, and in 1946 the United Kingdom implemented unconditional family allowances for the second and subsequent children of every family. In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onward, the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that have some similarities to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]] in Brazil. From 2008 onward, several experiments with basic income and related systems have taken place.\n\nGovernments can contribute to individual and household income maintenance strategies in three ways:\n \n# The government can establish a minimum income guarantee and not allow income to fall below levels set for various household types, maintaining these levels by paying [[means-tested benefit]]s.\n# [[Social insurance]] can pay benefits in the case of sickness, unemployment, or old age, on the basis of contributions paid\n#Universal unconditional payments, such as the United Kingdom's Child Benefit for children.<ref>{{cite book|title=How social security works|last=Spicker|first=Paul|date=19 January 2011|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=9781447342854|doi = 10.2307/j.ctt1t896gv}}</ref>\n\nIn more detail:\n\n# A means-tested benefit that raises a household's income to a guaranteed minimum level is unlike a basic income in that income delivered under a system of guaranteed minimum income is reduced proportionally as other sources of income increase whereas income received from a basic income is constant regardless of other sources of income. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492\u20131540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents \"not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity\". However, Vives also argued that to qualify for poor relief the recipient must \"deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work\".<ref>[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ \"History of Basic Income\"]. Basic Income Earth Network.</ref>\n# The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743\u20131794). After playing a prominent role in the [[French Revolution]], he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d\u2019un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l\u2019esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] Thomas Paine (1737\u20131809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet's death.\n# The first social movement for Basic Income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], Dennis Milner (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas]].\n* Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.\n* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled \"Scheme for a State Bonus\" (1918) that argued for the \"introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom\". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.\n* C. H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system he called [[social credit]], a combination of monetary reform and basic income.\n\nIn 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]] led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]] developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance, means-tested benefits and unconditional allowances for children. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.<ref name=sloman-2015>{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition= 1st publ.}}</ref> Her son Brandon Rhys Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982 and soon after that in 1984 the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizensincome.org/|title=Citizen's Income \u2013 An unconditional, nonwithdrawable income paid to every individual as a right of citizenship.|accessdate=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with the [[negative income tax]]. Then President [[Richard Nixon]] once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the Congress, but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens, thus:<ref name=Nixon_UBI>{{cite web|title=American President: Richard Milhous Nixon: Domestic Affairs|work=MillerCenter.org|publisher=Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|accessdate=28 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407202356/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/nixon/essays/biography/4|archive-date=7 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Quote\n|Nixon proposed more ambitious programs than he enacted, including the National Health Insurance Partnership Program, which promoted health maintenance organizations (HMOs). He also proposed a massive overhaul of federal welfare programs. The centerpiece of Nixon's welfare reform was the replacement of much of the welfare system with a negative income tax, a favorite proposal of conservative economist Milton Friedman. The purpose of the negative income tax was to provide both a safety net for the poor and a financial incentive for welfare recipients to work.\n}}In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years.<ref name=\"basicincome.org\" /> From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest. In West Germany, groups of unemployed people took a stance for the reform.<ref name=\"archiv-grundeinkommen.de\">Blaschke, Ronald (January 2010). [http://www.archiv-grundeinkommen.de/blaschke/20100127-The-Basic-Income-debate-in-Germany.pdf \"The basic income debate in Germany and some basic reflections\"].</ref>\n\nFrom 2010 onwards, Basic Income again became an active topic in many countries. Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives\u2014including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. For example, experiments in Canada, Finland, India and Namibia have received international media attention. The [[2016 Swiss referendums#Basic income referendum|first and only national referendum about basic income]] was held in Switzerland in 2016. The result was a rejection of the basic income proposal by a vote of 76.9% to 23.1%.\n\n== Perspectives in the basic income debate ==\n=== Automation ===\n{{main|Automation}}\n[[File:Andrew Yang by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Andrew Yang holding a microphone while making a speech|Entrepreneur and [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic candidate]] [[Andrew Yang]] has advocated for a basic income to counter [[Technological unemployment|job displacement through automation]]. His basic income policy, the [[Freedom Dividend]], aims to give every American adult $1,000 a month.]]\nThe debates about basic income and automation are closely linked. For example, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] argues that the increase in automation creates a greater need for basic income. Concerns about automation have prompted many in the high-technology industry to argue for basic income as an implication of their business models. U.S. presidential candidate and non-profit founder [[Andrew Yang]] has stated that automation caused the loss of 4 million manufacturing jobs in the Midwest and resulted in the election of [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/andrew-yangs-presidential-bid-is-so-very-21st-century/|title=Andrew Yang's Presidential Bid Is So Very 21st Century|last=Simon|first=Matt|date=2019-04-01|work=Wired|access-date=2019-08-17|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The CEO of [[Tesla, Inc.]] and [[SpaceX]], [[Elon Musk]], came out in support of basic income and Yang due to automation and AI.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/elon-musk-endorses-andrew-yang-president.html|title=SpaceX's Elon Musk Endorses Democratic Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang|author=Mike Wall |date=2019-08-13|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n\nMany technologists believe that automation, among other things, is creating [[technological unemployment]]. Journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] first highlighted the turn of the \"tech elite\" to these ideas with an article in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine which cited [[Marc Andreessen]], [[Sam Altman]], [[Peter Diamandis]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|date=6 January 2015|work=Vice}}</ref><ref name=\"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\">{{Cite report|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf |title=Economic Report of the President|date=February 2016|page=244|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|date=6 January 2015|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|work=Vice}}</ref> Some studies about automation and jobs validate these concerns. In a report to the Congress, the White House estimated that a worker earning less than $20 an hour in 2010 would eventually lose their job to a machine with 83% probability. Even workers earning as much as $40 an hour faced a probability of 31%.<ref name=\"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\" /> With a rising [[unemployment]] rate, poor communities would become more impoverished worldwide. Proponents of universal basic income argue that it could solve many world problems like high work stress and could create more opportunities and efficient and effective work. In a study in Dauphin, Manitoba, only 13% of labor decreased from a much higher expected number.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Forget |first=Evelyn L. |title=The Town With No Poverty: The Health Effects of a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income Field Experiment |journal=Canadian Public Policy |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=283\u2013305 |doi=10.3138/cpp.37.3.283}}</ref> In a study in several Indian villages, basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.<ref>{{cite web |first=Abhishek |last=Roy |publisher=Seven Pillars Institute |accessdate=16 July 2017 |title=Part 2 of SPI's Universal Basic Income Series |url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/universal-basic-income-empirical-studies/}}</ref>\n\nBesides technological unemployment, some tech-industry experts worry that automation would destabilize the labor market or increase [[economic inequality]]. One example is [[Chris Hughes]], co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years and while it has not permanently reduced the employment rate, it has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vall\u00e9e]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility as it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vall\u00e9e examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that paid labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead it increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|via=Google Docs|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Bad behavior ===\nCriticism of a basic income includes the argument that some recipients would spend a basic income on alcohol and other drugs.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\"/><ref>Koga, Kenya. \"Pennies From Heaven.\" Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67\u201368.

For him, basic income was part of a larger structural change of the economic system towards a more green and sustainable system.\n\n=== Different ideological arguments ===\n* Georgist views: [[geolibertarian]]s seek to synthesize propertarian libertarianism and a geoist (or [[Georgist]]) philosophy of [[land (economics)|land]] as unowned commons or equally owned by all people, citing the [[classical economics|classical economic]] distinction between unimproved land and private property. The rental value of land is produced by the labors of the community and, as such, rightly belongs to the community at large and not solely to the landholder. A [[land value tax]] (LVT) is levied as an annual fee for exclusive access to a section of earth which is collected and redistributed to the community either through [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s, such as public security or a court system, or in the form of a basic guaranteed income called a [[citizen's dividend]]. Geolibertarians view the LVT as a [[single tax]] to replace all other methods of taxation which are deemed unjust violations of the [[non-aggression principle]].\n* Conservative views: support for basic income has been expressed by several people associated with conservative political views. While adherents of such views generally favor minimization or abolition of the public provision of [[welfare]] services, some have cited basic income as a viable strategy to reduce the amount of bureaucratic administration that is prevalent in many contemporary welfare systems. Others have contended that it could also act as a form of compensation for [[fiat currency]] inflation.<ref name=\"perspectives\">{{cite web |url = http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/01/27/a-universal-basic-income-conservative-progressive-and-libertarian-perspectives-part-3-of-a-series/ |title = A Universal Basic Income: Conservative, Progressive, and Libertarian Perspectives |publisher = [[EconoMonitor]] |date = 27 January 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Dolan, Ed }}</ref><ref name=\"BI\">{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-2013-5 |title = There's A Way To Give Everyone In America An Income That Conservatives And Liberals Can Both Love |work = [[Business Insider]] |date = 13 May 2013 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Weisenthal, Joe }}</ref><ref name=\"conservative\">{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/ |title = The Conservative Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income |work = [[The Atlantic]] |date = 6 August 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Gordon, Noah }}</ref>\n* Feminist views: [[feminist]] views on basic income are loosely divided into two opposing views. One view supports basic income as a means of guaranteeing minimum financial independence for women and of recognizing women's [[unpaid work]] in the home.

In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher. Participants in these experiments knew that the experiment was limited in time.<ref name=\"cangov94\" />\n\nIn the [[Mincome]] experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba also in the 1970s, there were also slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment.

The researchers\u2014Damon Jones from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and [[Ioana Marinescu]] from the University of Pennsylvania School of Public Policy and Practice\u2014maintain that although there is a small decrease in work by recipients due to reasons like those in the Manitoba experiment, there has been a 17 percent increase in part-time jobs. The authors theorize that employment remained steady, because the extra income that let people buy more also increased demand for service jobs. This finding is consistent with the economic data of the time. No effect was seen when it came to jobs in manufacturing, which produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment. To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses the dividend to help with car payments can cut back on hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. Because more people are spending more, the store must replace the worker who started working less. Meanwhile, distribution of the dividend doesn't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop |publisher=Quartz|website=qz.com|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working\u2014but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work and not dissuade people out of the work force.\n\nAnother study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]].

Money is like an access ticket to use those resources, and so to make people equally free to do what they want with world assets, the government should give each individual as many such access tickets as possible\u2014that is, the highest sustainable basic income.\n\nKarl Widerquist and others have proposed a theory of freedom in which basic income is needed to protect the power to refuse work<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137274724|title=Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income \u2013 A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No |author= K. Widerquist  |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> which can be summarized as follows. If the resources necessary to an individual's survival are controlled by another group, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. Today, resources necessary for the production of food, shelter and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not.\n\nTherefore, the argument goes that the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.<ref name=\"Sheahen, Allan 2012\" /> Under this argument, personal, political and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no.

One example is that of [[Nelle Harper Lee]], who lived as a single woman in New York City in the 1950s, writing in her free time and supporting herself by working part-time as an airline clerk. She had written several long stories, but achieved no success of note.

UBI differs from the Keynesian concept of 'paying people to dig ditches and then filling them up again', as these people had a job and were doing something whether useful or not, it occupied their time.

Stout|Lynn Stout]] and her co-authors Tamara Belinfanti and Sergio Gramitto in their book ''Citizen Capitalism: How A Universal Fund Can Provide Influence and Income to All'' which was published in 2019. In the book, Stout and her co-authors propose the building of a not-for-profit universal fund composed of shares donated by corporations and philanthropic individuals in which every American would receive one share. These shares could not be sold, bequeathed, donated, or borrowed against, but each \"citizen shareholder\" would receive an even portion of the net dividends paid out by shares in the fund, therefore contributing to the amelioration of income inequality. Each shareholder would also receive additional influence in the form of a vote (corresponding to their shares in the fund), providing in theory for a significantly expanded degree of citizen engagement in the role that public corporations play in American society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://citizencapitalism.org/|title=Citizen Capitalism|website=Citizen Capitalism|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Basic income in crypto currencies and as part of social media apps ===\nNimses is a concept that offers universal basic income to every member of its system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://futurism.com/what-will-the-currency-of-a-workless-cashless-future-be|title=What Will the Currency of a Workless, Cashless Future Be?|website=Futurism|language=en|access-date=2019-01-25}}</ref> The idea of Nimses consists of [[time-based currency]] called Nim (1 nim = 1 minute of life).

So far no country has introduced an unconditional basic income as law.\n\n== Public opinion ==\nSupport for a universal basic income varies widely across Europe, as shown by a recent wave of the European Social Survey. A high share of the population tends to support the scheme in southern and central eastern European Union countries, while support tends to be lower in western European countries such as France and Germany, and even lower in Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweden. Individuals who face greater economic insecurity, for instance because of low income and unemployment tend to be more supportive of a basic income.<ref>Tim Vlandas, \"The Politics of the Basic Income Guarantee: Analysing Individual Support in Europe\", ''Basic Income Studies'', vol. 14, no. 1 (06 June 2019)  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/bis-2018-0021 </ref> Overall, support tends to be on average higher in countries where existing unemployment benefits are not generous and/or where the unemployed are activated in the sense that the receipt of benefits is conditional on certain job search behaviour <ref>Tim Vlandas, \"The Political Economy of Individual Level Support for the Basic Income in Europe\", ''[[Journal of European Social Policy]]'', forthcoming (2020)  https://vlandas.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/vlandas_jesp_basic-income_december2019_acceptedversion.pdf </ref>\n\nA poll conducted by the [[University of Chicago]] indicates that 51% of Americans from the ages of 18\u201336 support a monthly basic income of $1,000.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bowden |first1=John |title=Majority of young Americans support universal basic income, public healthcare: poll |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/490297-study-indicates-majority-of-young-americans-support-universal |accessdate=31 March 2020 |work=The Hill |date=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Petitions, polls and referendums ==\n* 2008: an official petition for basic income was started in [[Germany]] by [[Susanne Wiest]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.piratenpartei.de/2013/06/27/bundestag-will-petition-zum-bedingungslosen-grundeinkommen-ohne-diskussion-abschliesen/ |title = Bundestag will Petition zum bedingungslosen Grundeinkommen ohne Diskussion abschlie\u00dfen \u203a Piratenpartei Deutschland |publisher = Piratenpartei.de |date =  |accessdate = 5 June 2016 }}</ref> The petition was accepted and Susanne Wiest was invited for a hearing at the German parliament's Commission of Petitions.

Looking at its north to south orientation, it is shaped like an inverted T, about {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=in|frac=4}} long and {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=in|frac=4}} wide. A road bridge connects its northern end to the mainland of England at [[Langstone, Hampshire|Langstone]].  The [[Hayling Ferry]] is a small pedestrian ferry connecting to the [[Eastney]] area of the city of [[Portsmouth]] on the neighbouring [[Portsea Island]]. To the west is [[Langstone Harbour]] and to the east is [[Chichester Harbour]].\n\nThe natural beach at Hayling was predominantly sandy, but in recent years it has been mechanically topped with shingle dredged from the bed of the Solent in an effort to reduce beach erosion and reduce the potential to flood low-lying land. At low tide, the [[East Winner]] sandbank is visible, extending a mile out to sea. The coastline in this area has substantially changed since Roman times: it is believed much land has been lost from the coasts of Hayling and Selsey by erosion and subsequent flooding.\n\n==Climate==\n\nAs with the rest of the [[British Isles]] and Southern England, Hayling Island experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters. Temperatures have never fallen into double figures below freezing, illustrating the relative warmth of the island \u2013 comparable to the far southwest of England and its neighbour, the [[Isle of Wight]].

Looking at its north to south orientation, it is shaped like an inverted T, about {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=in|frac=4}} long and {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=in|frac=4}} wide. A road bridge connects its northern end to the mainland of England at [[Langstone, Hampshire|Langstone]].  The [[Hayling Ferry]] is a small pedestrian ferry connecting to the [[Eastney]] area of the city of [[Portsmouth]] on the neighbouring [[Portsea Island]]. To the west is [[Langstone Harbour]] and to the east is [[Chichester Harbour]].\n\nThe natural beach at Hayling was predominantly sandy, but in recent years it has been mechanically topped with shingle dredged from the bed of the Solent in an effort to reduce beach erosion and reduce the potential to flood low-lying land. At low tide, the [[East Winner]] sandbank is visible, extending a mile out to sea. The coastline in this area has substantially changed since Roman times: it is believed much land has been lost from the coasts of Hayling and Selsey by erosion and subsequent flooding.\n\n==Climate==\n\nAs with the rest of the [[British Isles]] and Southern England, Hayling Island experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters. Temperatures have never fallen into double figures below freezing, illustrating the relative warmth of the island \u2013 comparable to the far southwest of England and its neighbour, the [[Isle of Wight]].
