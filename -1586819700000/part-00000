{"title_page": "Action at a distance", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Action (physics)}}\n{{For|the anti-pattern in computer science|Action at a distance (computer programming)}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''action at a distance''' is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object. That is, it is the nonlocal interaction of objects that are separated in space.\n\nThis term was used most often in the context of early theories of [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]] to describe how an object responds to the influence of distant objects. For example, [[Coulomb's law]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] are such early theories.\n\nMore generally \"action at a distance\" describes the failure of early [[atomism|atomistic]] and [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic theories]] which sought to reduce all physical interaction to collision. The exploration and resolution of this problematic phenomenon led to significant developments in physics, from the concept of a field, to descriptions of [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[gauge boson|mediator particles]] of the [[Standard Model]].<ref name=\"Hesse\">{{cite journal |title=Action at a Distance in Classical Physics |journal=Isis |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=337\u2013353 |author=Hesse, Mary B. |authorlink=Mary Hesse |jstor=227576 |date=December 1955 |doi=10.1086/348429 }}</ref>\n\n==Electricity and magnetism==\nPhilosopher [[William of Ockham]] discussed action at a distance to explain [[magnetism]] and the ability of the Sun to heat the Earth's atmosphere without affecting the intervening space.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tachau |first=Katherine H. |title=Vision and Certitude in the Age of Ockham: Optics, Epistemology, and the Foundations of Semantics, 1250\u20131345 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=9004085521 |p=133}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to account for action at a distance in the theory of electromagnetism led to the development of the concept of a [[field (physics)|field]] which mediated interactions between currents and charges across empty space. According to field theory, we account for the [[Coulomb]] (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an [[electric field]], which can be felt by other charges as a force. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1873.<ref>[[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] (1873) [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00maxwgoog A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism], pages 426\u2013438, link from [[Internet Archive]]</ref> He began by reviewing the explanation of [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's formula]] given by [[Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]]. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring \"action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light\". This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an [[electromagnetic field]] described by [[Maxwell's equations]], which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.\n\nElectrodynamics was later described without fields (in [[Minkowski space]])  as the direct interaction of particles with [[Lightlike#Causal structure|lightlike]] separation vectors.{{Dubious|date=August 2015}} This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called \"direct interaction\" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters).<ref>Barut, A. O. \"Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles\"</ref> This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (a field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.\n\nDirect interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles.  Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and [[radiative damping]] (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations (these are the so-called [[No Interaction Theorems]]). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the [[Lamb shift]]  which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field.  Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory]] and [[Modern physics]] has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\n==Gravity==\n{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}\n\n===Newton===\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. <!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).<ref name=\"sep-qm-action-distance\"/>\n\nA related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term [[Mach's principle]] for this question.\n\n{{quote|It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.

But Newton agreed, in Janiak\u2019s view, with an immaterial [[Aether theories|ether]], which he considered that Newton identifies himself with [[God]] himself: \u201cNewton obviously thinks that God might be the very \u201cimmaterial medium\u201d underlying all gravitational interactions among material bodies.\u201d\n\nSteffen Ducheyne, in ''Newton on Action at a Distance''<ref>Steffen Ducheyne (2011) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.003 Newton on Action at a Distance and the Cause of Gravity], Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 42 (1): 154\u201359</ref>, considered that Newton never accepted direct remote action, only material intervention or immaterial substance.\n\nHylarie Kochiras, in ''Gravity and Newton\u2019s substance counting problem''<ref>Hylarie Kochiras (2009) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2009.07.003 Gravity and Newton\u2019s Substance Counting Problem], Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 40 (3): 267\u201380</ref>, argued that Newton was inclined to reject direct action, giving priority to the hypothesis of an intangible environment. But, in his speculative moments, Newton oscillated between accepting and rejecting direct remote action. Newton, according to Kochiras, claims that [[God]] is a virtual omnipresent, the force/agent must subsist in substance, and God is omnipresent substantially, resulting in a hidden premise, the principle of local action.\n\nEric Schliesser, in ''Newton\u2019s substance monism, distant action, and the nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism''<ref>Eric Schliesser (2011) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.004 Newton\u2019s Substance Monism, Distant Action, and the Nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism: Discussion of H. Kochiras \u2018Gravity and Newton\u2019s Substance Counting Problem], Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 42 (1): 160\u201366</ref>, argued that Newton does not categorically refuse the idea that matter is active, and therefore accepted the possibility of a direct action at a distance. Newton affirms the virtual omnipresence of God in addition to his substantial omnipresence.\n\nJohn Henry, in ''Gravity and De gravitatione: The Development of Newton\u2019s Ideas on Action at a Distance''<ref>[[John Henry (historian)|John Henry]] (2011) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.025 Gravity and De Gravitatione: The Development of Newton\u2019s Ideas on Action at a Distance], Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 42 (1): 11\u201327</ref>, also argued that direct remote action was not inconceivable for Newton, rejecting the idea that gravity can be explained by subtle matter, accepting the idea of an omnipotent [[God]], and rejecting the Epicurean attraction.\n\nFor further discussion see Ducheyne, S. \"Newton on Action at a Distance\". ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'' vol. 52.4 (2014): 675\u2013702.\n\n===Einstein===\nAccording to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], ''instantaneous action at a distance'' violates the relativistic [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|upper limit on speed]] of propagation of information. If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]].\n\nOne of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed {{math|'''''c'''''}}, the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a [[Field (physics)|field]], or something similar.\n\nThis has been achieved by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are\u2014as with electric and magnetic fields\u2014propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].\n\nMach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of [[geodesic]]s.\n\nAs a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit [[gravitational wave]]s, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like [[Tests of general relativity|many other aspects of relativity]]) has been [[Gravitational wave#Detection|experimentally confirmed]] by astronomers\u2014most dramatically in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|direct detection of gravitational waves]] originating from a [[black hole merger]] when they passed through [[LIGO#Advanced LIGO|LIGO]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/ligo-first-detection-gravitational-waves-0211 | title=Scientists make first direct detection of gravitational waves}}</ref>\n\n==Quantum mechanics==<!-- This section is linked from [[Time travel]] -->\n{{See also|Quantum nonlocality}}\nSince the early twentieth century, [[quantum mechanics]] has posed new challenges for the view that physical processes should obey [[Principle of locality|locality]]. Whether [[quantum entanglement]] counts as action-at-a-distance hinges on the nature of the [[wave function]] and [[decoherence]], issues over which there is still considerable debate among scientists and philosophers.\n\nOne important line of debate originated with Einstein, who challenged the idea that quantum mechanics offers a complete description of reality, along with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]. They proposed a [[thought experiment]] involving an entangled pair of observables with non-commuting operators (e.g. position and momentum).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777\u2013780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThis thought experiment, which came to be known as the [[EPR paradox]], hinges on the principle of locality.

According to field theory, we account for the [[Coulomb]] (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an [[electric field]], which can be felt by other charges as a force. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1873.<ref>[[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] (1873) [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00maxwgoog A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism], pages 426\u2013438, link from [[Internet Archive]]</ref> He began by reviewing the explanation of [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's formula]] given by [[Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]]. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring \"action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light\". This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an [[electromagnetic field]] described by [[Maxwell's equations]], which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.\n\nElectrodynamics was later described without fields (in [[Minkowski space]])  as the direct interaction of particles with [[Lightlike#Causal structure|lightlike]] separation vectors.{{Dubious|date=August 2015}} This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called \"direct interaction\" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters).<ref>Barut, A. O. \"Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles\"</ref> This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (the field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.\n\nDirect interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles.  Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and [[radiative damping]] (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations (these are the so-called [[No Interaction Theorems]]). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the [[Lamb shift]]  which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field.  Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory]] and [[Modern physics]] has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\n==Gravity==\n{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}\n\n===Newton===\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. <!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).<ref name=\"sep-qm-action-distance\"/>\n\nA related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term [[Mach's principle]] for this question.\n\n{{quote|It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.

But, in his speculative moments, Newton oscillated between accepting and rejecting direct remote action. Newton, according to Kochiras, claims that [[God]] is a virtual omnipresent, the force/agent must subsist in substance, and God is omnipresent substantially, resulting in a hidden premise, the principle of local action.\n\nEric Schliesser, in ''Newton\u2019s substance monism, distant action, and the nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism''<ref>Eric Schliesser (2011) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.004 Newton\u2019s Substance Monism, Distant Action, and the Nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism: Discussion of H.

''Journal of the History of Philosophy'' vol. 52.4 (2014): 675\u2013702.\n\n===Einstein===\nAccording to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], ''instantaneous action at a distance'' violates the relativistic [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|upper limit on speed]] of propagation of information. If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]].\n\nOne of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed {{math|'''''c'''''}}, the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a [[Field (physics)|field]], or something similar.\n\nThis has been achieved by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are\u2014as with electric and magnetic fields\u2014propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].\n\nMach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of [[geodesic]]s.\n\nAs a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit [[gravitational wave]]s, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like [[Tests of general relativity|many other aspects of relativity]]) has been [[Gravitational wave#Detection|experimentally confirmed]] by astronomers\u2014most dramatically in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|direct detection of gravitational waves]] originating from a [[black hole merger]] when they passed through [[LIGO#Advanced LIGO|LIGO]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/ligo-first-detection-gravitational-waves-0211 | title=Scientists make first direct detection of gravitational waves}}</ref>\n\n==Quantum mechanics==<!-- This section is linked from [[Time travel]] -->\n{{See also|Quantum nonlocality}}\nSince the early twentieth century, [[quantum mechanics]] has posed new challenges for the view that physical processes should obey [[Principle of locality|locality]]. Whether [[quantum entanglement]] counts as action-at-a-distance hinges on the nature of the [[wave function]] and [[decoherence]], issues over which there is still considerable debate among scientists and philosophers.\n\nOne important line of debate originated with Einstein, who challenged the idea that quantum mechanics offers a complete description of reality, along with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]. They proposed a [[thought experiment]] involving an entangled pair of observables with non-commuting operators (e.g. position and momentum).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777\u2013780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThis thought experiment, which came to be known as the [[EPR paradox]], hinges on the principle of locality.

William Fowler called this a \"silent comedy\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \"the Moore\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \"secret convoy\", hidden ropes and mechanism.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> The role may have represented [[Gawain]], as he appears in the ''[[Knight of the Cart]]'' substituted for \"[[Ywain]]\" in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''.

This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]], as if [[Neptune]], the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \"conspiracies of witches\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also onboard, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], as [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref>\n\nThe ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while [[Arion]] seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by [[Psalm 128]] in canon with musical accompaniment.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\".</ref> Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions:<blockquote>\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that none could perceive what brought her in.\"<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref></blockquote>\n\nJames and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet. Sugar confections and sculptures were made for the court by Jacques de Boussy, a French or Flemish specialist.<ref>Michael Pearce, 'Riddle's Court, Banquet & Diplomacy in 1598', ''History Scotland'' 12:4 (2012), pp. 20-7: [[Marguerite Wood]], ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1589-1603'' (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 362.</ref> Meanwhile, the Great Hall was cleared for revels, which Fowler did not describe further. The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors.\n\nIn 1610 the masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'' at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]] also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Milford Haven]] harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers. The banquet at the King James's baptism in December 1566 at Stirling Castle had also involved food on moving stages, with dancing choreographed by [[Bastian Pagez]].\n\n==Ambassadors and diplomatic gift-giving==\n[[File:Anne of Denmark, ca 1600.jpg|thumb|right|'''Anne of Denmark''' accepted gifts from the ambassadors in a ceremony held in her audience chamber in the palace.]]\n[[Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex]] was the ambassador from England.

The Chapel Royal was purpose-built in 1594 under the direction of William Schaw, who was [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland|Master of Work]] to the king and the queen, and an administrator of the queen's landed income. The building has an central triumphal arch as an entrance, flanked by Italianate windows, and can be described as the first Renaissance style church in Britain.<ref>Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', ''Architectural History'', vol. 54 (2011), pp. 91, 103.</ref> The north fa\u00e7ade is featureless.

Campbell and MacKechnie propose that the physical embodiment of the Temple in the architecture, rather than the allusion to kingship made by Colville, was a secret kept by the masons.<ref>Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', ''Architectural History'', vol. 54 (2011), pp. 110-2.</ref>\n\n==The Legacy for Historians==\nThe events of the baptism were intended to convey a cluster of meanings; the genealogy of Prince Henry, the legitimacy of the Scottish succession to the crown of England, the wealth of Scotland, its faith, the difficulties that James VI and Anne of Denmark faced crossing the sea as an epic battle against witchcraft, and Scotland's presence on the international stage. Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances.

William Fowler called this a \"silent comedy\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \"the Moore\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \"secret convoy\", hidden ropes and mechanism.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> The role may have represented [[Gawain]], as he appears in the ''[[Knight of the Cart]]'' substituted for \"[[Ywain]]\" in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. The exact reference intended is unclear in the evidence.\n\nThe African actor may have performed in 1590 at [[Entry and Coronation of Anne of Denmark|Anne of Denmark's Entry into Edinburgh]]. The queen also had an African servant in her household listed as \"the Moir\" in 1590, who was bought clothes with her pages, but there is no further record of this man.<ref>[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 144.]</ref>\n\nAfter this tableau was removed, a large model ship was brought into the Great Hall, or uncovered there. This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]], as if [[Neptune]], the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \"conspiracies of witches\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also onboard, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], as [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref>\n\nThe ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while [[Arion]] seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by [[Psalm 128]] in canon with musical accompaniment.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\".</ref> Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions:<blockquote>\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that none could perceive what brought her in.\"<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref></blockquote>\n\nJames and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet. Sugar confections and sculptures were made for the court by Jacques de Boussy, a French or Flemish specialist.<ref>Michael Pearce, 'Riddle's Court, Banquet & Diplomacy in 1598', ''History Scotland'' 12:4 (2012), pp. 20-7: [[Marguerite Wood]], ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1589-1603'' (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 362.</ref> Meanwhile, the Great Hall was cleared for revels, which Fowler did not describe further. The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors.\n\nIn 1610 the masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'' at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]] also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Milford Haven]] harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers. The banquet at the King James's baptism in December 1566 at Stirling Castle had also involved food on moving stages, with dancing choreographed by [[Bastian Pagez]].\n\n==Ambassadors and diplomatic gift-giving==\n[[File:Anne of Denmark, ca 1600.jpg|thumb|right|'''Anne of Denmark''' accepted gifts from the ambassadors in a ceremony held in her audience chamber in the palace.]]\n[[Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex]] was the ambassador from England.

Anne however was forced to stay in Norway by accidents and bad weather, the circumstances which gave rise to Fowler mentioning thanksgiving for deliverance from witchcraft. The ambassador's masque would have comprised; six dancers wearing swords or [[falchion]]s with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torch bearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets. Only the account for making the costumes is known, and the subject of the masque was not recorded.<ref>Henry Morley, ''Masques and Entertainments by Ben Jonson'' (London, 1890), pp. xii-xiii: James Robinson Planche, ''A Cyclopedia Of Costume'', vol. 2 (London, 1879), p. 394: John Payne Collier, ''Annals of the Stage'', vol. 1 (London, 1831), pp. 270-1, citing British Library Lansdowne MS 59.</ref> At the same time, James VI had sent [[Roger Aston]] to [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at Carlisle for actors from the [[Queen Elizabeth's Men|Queen's Players]] who were at [[Knowsley Hall]] to perform in Edinburgh.

He said two of the Scottish envoys sent with invitations were unsuitable. Sir [[William Keith of Delny]] could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish, and the [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross|laird of Easter Wemyss]] was chosen only because he happened to be travelling to London and Paris on his own business. Melville states that [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]] went to Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenberg, and was rewarded with gifts of three gold chains, but the dukes felt they would have been better honoured by a separate ambassador to each of them. Easter Wemyss received no rewards, because he was a messenger and did not have the status of an ambassador. Melville claimed that Elizabeth was more enthusiastic to be represented at the event when she learnt that [[Henry IV of France]] was not sending an ambassador.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill'' (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 411.</ref>\n\nThe Danish ambassadors and the ambassadors from the two German dukes had arrived in Leith on 11 and 12 July.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 376.</ref> Melville was appointed to greet them, but he could not persuade them to ride up to [[Holyrood Palace]] together in the same convoy and instead had to organise two processions. As the day of the masque and baptism was postponed, Melville had to entertain the ambassadors in Edinburgh, with his brothers [[Jane Kennedy (courtier)|Andrew Melville of Garvock]] and William Melville [[Tongland Abbey|Commendator of Tungland]].<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill'' (Edinburgh, 1827),  pp. 410-413.</ref> Robert Bowes said the ambassadors were entertained by various lairds of Lothian in turn, at the king's request. [[John Colville (c. 1540\u20131605)|John Colville]] wrote that the day after the ambassadors arrived Anne of Denmark took the ferry to [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]] and went to [[Falkland Palace]] to avoid them because she felt her accommodation at [[Holyroodhouse]] was not up to scratch.

The building has an central triumphal arch as an entrance, flanked by Italianate windows, and can be described as the first Renaissance style church in Britain.<ref>Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', ''Architectural History'', vol. 54 (2011), pp. 91, 103.</ref> The north fa\u00e7ade is featureless.

Campbell and MacKechnie propose that the physical embodiment of the Temple in the architecture, rather than the allusion to kingship made by Colville, was a secret kept by the masons.<ref>Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', ''Architectural History'', vol. 54 (2011), pp. 110-2.</ref>\n\n==The Legacy for Historians==\nThe events of the baptism were intended to convey a cluster of meanings; the genealogy of Prince Henry, the legitimacy of the Scottish succession to the crown of England, the wealth of Scotland, its faith, the difficulties that James VI and Anne of Denmark faced crossing the sea as an epic battle against witchcraft, and Scotland's presence on the international stage. Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances.

It was the first time in English history that a speaker of the House of Commons had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.\n\n==Early life==\nLenthall was born in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]],<ref>{{NHLE |num=1218864 |desc=Speaker's House |grade=II |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> the second son of William Lenthall (d. 1596) and Frances Southwell,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} and was educated at [[Thame]] school.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He matriculated at [[Merton College, Oxford#St Alban Hall|St Alban Hall]] [[University of Oxford]] in 1607 but left in 1609 without taking a degree.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He moved to [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1616, becoming a [[bencher]] of the inn in 1633.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He built up a successful legal practice, becoming [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of Woodstock in 1621, an Oxfordshire [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]] in 1631, and recorder of Gloucester in 1638.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}}\n==Early parliamentary career and Short Parliament==\n{{main|Short Parliament}}\n\nLenthall's parliamentary career began in 1624 when he sat as [[Member of parliament|member]] for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|New Woodstock]] in Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He failed to be re-elected in 1625,{{sfn|Thrush|2010|pp=98\u201399}} but again represented the constituency during the 1640 [[Short Parliament]], on several occasions being called upon to chair grand committees of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House]] on important subjects, including [[ship money]] and parliamentary grievances.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} The Short Parliament was dissolved on 5 May 1640 after only three weeks.\n      \n==Long Parliament==\n{{main|Long Parliament}}\nWhen [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] recalled parliament once more on 4 November 1640, at the start of what became known as the [[Long Parliament]], Lenthall again attended on behalf of New Woodstock.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} Discovering that his preferred candidate for [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker]], [[Thomas Gardiner (Royalist)|Sir Thomas Gardiner]], had failed to be returned, the king reviewed the list of available lawyers and approved Lenthall as the new speaker,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} a position that Lenthall was to hold for most of the next twenty years.\n\nFrom the start, Lenthall had his critics. [[Henry Mildmay|Sir Henry Mildmay]] criticised him for letting too many speak during a debate, he was accused of partiality and procedural errors, and at one point was made to look foolish over a point of precedence.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} However, the journal of [[Simonds d'Ewes|Sir Simonds d'Ewes]] (who was not generally supportive) suggests that in the opening months of the Long Parliament Lenthall was very much in control of proceedings.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nDuring 1640\u20131641 Lenthall proved himself a competent speaker. He introduced or codified a variety of procedural rules including the establishment of the duration of [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]] before and after sittings, the imposition of a penalty for speaking when another member had the floor, and the rule that while one piece of business was before the House a motion on another could not be made.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nBy late 1641 Lenthall was finding the House's long sittings physically exhausting and he became increasingly desperate to be relieved of the speakership. He was also concerned about his personal finances, pleading the prospect of financial ruin if he were to continue. In the event, however, he was to remain in post, with only a few gaps, for many more years.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n===The king's attempted seizure of the Five Members===\n\n[[File:Attempted Arrest of the Five members by Charles West Cope.jpg|thumb|Lenthall kneels to [[Charles I of England|Charles]] during the attempted arrest of the [[Five Members]]]]\n{{main|Five Members}}\nThe relationship between the House of Commons and [[Charles I of England|the king]] became increasingly fraught during 1641, and at the end of the year Charles launched in the [[House of Lords]] accusations of [[treason]] against [[Five Members|five leading members]] of the Commons.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The Commons sat to consider the allegations on 3 January 1642, and held them to be a breach of the House's [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|privilege]].{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} Provoked, and determined that the Five Members should not escape arrest, Charles decided to go to the House of Commons himself to apprehend them.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The next day, 4 January, he arrived in person, accompanied by about 400 armed men, and entered the Commons chamber.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}} Addressing Lenthall, he said \"Mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair\". Lenthall vacated it. Calling first for one of the members, and then another, Charles was met with total silence. He asked the speaker where they were.

He served as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] for a period of almost twenty years, both before and after the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. \n\nHe is best remembered for his dignified defiance of the king on 4 January 1642 when Charles entered the chamber of the House of Commons, supported by 400 armed men, in an attempt to seize [[Five Members|five members]] whom he accused of [[treason]]. When Charles asked Lenthall where the five were, Lenthall famously replied \"I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me\". It was the first time in English history that a speaker of the House of Commons had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.\n\n==Early life==\nLenthall was born in [[Henley-on-Thames]], [[Oxfordshire]],<ref>{{NHLE |num=1218864 |desc=Speaker's House |grade=II |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> the second son of William Lenthall (d. 1596) and Frances Southwell,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} and was educated at [[Thame]] school.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He matriculated at [[Merton College, Oxford#St Alban Hall|St Alban Hall]] [[University of Oxford]] in 1607 but left in 1609 without taking a degree.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He moved to [[Lincoln's Inn]] and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1616, becoming a [[bencher]] of the inn in 1633.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He built up a successful legal practice, becoming [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of Woodstock in 1621, an Oxfordshire [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]] in 1631, and recorder of Gloucester in 1638.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}}\n==Early parliamentary career and Short Parliament==\n{{main|Short Parliament}}\n\nLenthall's parliamentary career began in 1624 when he sat as [[Member of parliament|member]] for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|New Woodstock]] in Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} He failed to be re-elected in 1625,{{sfn|Thrush|2010|pp=98\u201399}} but again represented the constituency during the 1640 [[Short Parliament]], on several occasions being called upon to chair grand committees of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House]] on important subjects, including [[ship money]] and parliamentary grievances.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Family background and early career\"}} The Short Parliament was dissolved on 5 May 1640 after only three weeks.\n      \n==Long Parliament==\n{{main|Long Parliament}}\nWhen [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] recalled parliament once more on 4 November 1640, at the start of what became known as the [[Long Parliament]], Lenthall again attended on behalf of New Woodstock.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} Discovering that his preferred candidate for [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker]], [[Thomas Gardiner (Royalist)|Sir Thomas Gardiner]], had failed to be returned, the king reviewed the list of available lawyers and approved Lenthall as the new speaker,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} a position that Lenthall was to hold for most of the next twenty years.\n\nFrom the start, Lenthall had his critics. [[Henry Mildmay|Sir Henry Mildmay]] criticised him for letting too many speak during a debate, he was accused of partiality and procedural errors, and at one point was made to look foolish over a point of precedence.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} However, the journal of [[Simonds d'Ewes|Sir Simonds d'Ewes]] (who was not generally supportive) suggests that in the opening months of the Long Parliament Lenthall was very much in control of proceedings.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nDuring 1640\u20131641 Lenthall proved himself a competent speaker. He introduced or codified a variety of procedural rules including the establishment of the duration of [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|parliamentary privilege]] before and after sittings, the imposition of a penalty for speaking when another member had the floor, and the rule that while one piece of business was before the House a motion on another could not be made.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\nBy late 1641 Lenthall was finding the House's long sittings physically exhausting and he became increasingly desperate to be relieved of the speakership. He was also concerned about his personal finances, pleading the prospect of financial ruin if he were to continue. In the event, however, he was to remain in post, with only a few gaps, for many more years.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n===The king's attempted seizure of the Five Members===\n\n[[File:Attempted Arrest of the Five members by Charles West Cope.jpg|thumb|Lenthall kneels to [[Charles I of England|Charles]] during the attempted arrest of the [[Five Members]]]]\n{{main|Five Members}}\nThe relationship between the House of Commons and [[Charles I of England|the king]] became increasingly fraught during 1641, and at the end of the year Charles launched in the [[House of Lords]] accusations of [[treason]] against [[Five Members|five leading members]] of the Commons.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The Commons sat to consider the allegations on 3 January 1642, and held them to be a breach of the House's [[Parliamentary privilege in the United Kingdom|privilege]].{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} Provoked, and determined that the Five Members should not escape arrest, Charles decided to go to the House of Commons himself to apprehend them.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} The next day, 4 January, he arrived in person, accompanied by about 400 armed men, and entered the Commons chamber.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}} Addressing Lenthall, he said \"Mr Speaker, I must for a time make bold with your chair\". Lenthall vacated it. Calling first for one of the members, and then another, Charles was met with total silence. He asked the speaker where they were.  Kneeling, Lenthall responded with extraordinary courage:{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n{{Quote\n|text=May it please your majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here; and I humbly beg your majesty's pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me.\n}}\nIt was the first time that a speaker had declared his allegiance to the liberty of parliament rather than the will of the monarch.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe King paused. \"'Tis no matter, I think my eyes are as good as another's\". He studied the benches for 'a pretty while' then lamented \"all my birds have flown\". He left the chair and walked out 'in a more discontented and angry passion than he came in',{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} followed by shouts of \"Privilege! Privilege!\" from the members.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}}\n\nCharles's intended show of strength had failed, he left London less than a week later,{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=107\u2013108}} and within months the country was plunged into civil war.\n\nLenthall's defence of his office was acknowledged by the House on 9 April, when it awarded him the sum of \u00a36000.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}} In the last speech that Lenthall delivered to the king he talked of reconciliation, and invited Charles to rid himself of false counsellors.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The Long Parliament\"}}\n\n===Civil War===\n\n[[File:William Lenthall.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of William Lenthall by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]]]\n\nParliament continued to sit during the [[English Civil War|civil war]], acting now without the king's authority. Lenthall remained in the chair, supporting the Parliamentary cause but without much sympathy toward those diehard protestants who were seeking radical ecclesiastical reform.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} In November 1642, he argued forcefully that the Commons should send peace proposals to the king.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\nLenthall's appointment to a series of high offices during this period brought some relief to his preoccupation with his personal finances: during the 1640s he became [[Master of the Rolls]], a [[Lord Chancellor|commissioner of the Great Seal]], and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]].{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} Nevertheless, his worries continued especially since with the coming of war his estates near [[Oxford]] were at risk of confiscation by the [[Cavalier|royalists.]]{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} In June 1649 a labourer broke into his London house and stole \u00a31900; he was later caught, tried, and sentenced to hang.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\nBy 1647 popular dissent was growing against the power of the [[New Model Army]] and the oppressions of local committees.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} The Long Parliament found itself increasingly unpopular, having imposed punitive taxation and chosen a course which had led to slaughter without any identifiable achievement.{{sfn|Field|2011|p=113}} On 26 July a mob invaded parliament to force it to agree to the army's [[Solemn Engagement]]{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=256}} (its refusal to disband until its grievances were met). The speaker was held in the chair by force{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=256}} and was compelled to put to the vote a resolution inviting the king to London.{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=256}}\n\nOn 31 July 1647 Lenthall published a personal declaration stating that votes in the Commons had been forced, rendering them void.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} He declared that he would take himself to the army, and would return only when free to resume his office.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} Along with fifty-seven other members, eight peers and the speaker of the Lords, he left London.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}} The fugitive members were well-received by the soldiers, and they were invited by their commander [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Baron Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] to review 15,000 men on [[Hounslow Heath]] on 3 August.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}}  Fairfax's regiments encircled London the next day, and under his protection Lenthall and the other fugitives were escorted in triumph back to parliament.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}}  Lenthall was re-installed in the chair,{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} and all votes passed during his absence were subsequently annulled.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=379}}\n\nLenthall sympathized with the Independents in parliament, and was portrayed by royalist newspapers in 1648 as being their tool, plotting to manipulate the House in their interests.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} But he did not always act as expected, for example using his casting vote in favour of continuing negotiations with the king.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\n===Pride's Purge===\n\n{{main|Pride's Purge}}\nOn 6 December 1648, in an event known as [[Pride's Purge]], troops of the New Model Army under the command of [[Thomas Pride|Colonel Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from parliament all those who were not Independents or Army supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} Lenthall remained silent, and had probably been warned in advance.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} He was certainly consulted on several occasions by Independent leaders during the December crisis.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}} \n\n=== Rump Parliament ===\n{{Main|Rump Parliament}}\nThe Purge had reduced the Commons to a [[Rump Parliament|rump]] of a little over 200 [[Roundhead|hard-line members]].{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=213}} Lenthall remained in post during the debates and resolutions that led ultimately to [[Execution of Charles I|Charles's execution]] on 30 January 1649, though there is no evidence that he was otherwise active in the events leading up to the [[regicide]].{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"The speaker during the civil war\"}}\n\nIn February 1649, the House voted to abolish both the [[House of Lords|House of Peers]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]],{{sfn|Field|2011|p=118}} and Lenthall found himself speaker of a new supreme [[Unicameralism|unicameral parliament]]. Though holding little real power, Lenthall as its representative became the leading citizen of England.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}} Although the first to take the engagement of loyalty to the new [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], he remained cautious and conservative in his approach to public affairs.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}}\n\nIn December 1651 [[Oliver Cromwell]] arranged a meeting at the speaker's house to discuss options for future government.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=521}} Lenthall, along with the other lawyers present, argued against the idea of a pure [[republic]] and in favour of a mixed constitution incorporating some role for a monarch.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=521}}\n===Cromwell's dismissal of the Rump===\n[[File:WilliamLenthall1652.jpg|thumb|upright|Lenthall in about 1652]]\nThe Rump Parliament had undertaken to dissolve itself \"as soon as may possibly stand with the safety of the people\".{{sfn|Field|2011|p=119}} But it failed to do so, and on 20 April 1653 it was forcibly dissolved by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] and other leading army officers.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}} Supported by [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Colonel Thomas Harrison]] and 30 or 40 musketeers, Cromwell ordered the chamber to be cleared.{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=530}} Lenthall once again rose to the occasion, announcing to Harrison that he would not come down unless he was pulled out.{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=305}} Harrison stretched out an arm and Lenthall submitted,{{sfn|Hibbert|1993|p=305}} doubtless realising the futility of resistance.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}}\n\nLenthall had become associated with the shortcomings of the Rump, and he found no place in the [[Barebone's Parliament|Nominated Assembly]] that sat between July and December 1653.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\"Speaker during the Commonwealth\"}}\n=== First Protectorate Parliament ===\n{{main|First Protectorate Parliament}}\nThe [[First Protectorate Parliament]] was summoned in 1654 by Cromwell, in his new role as [[Lord Protector]].

He nevertheless took a full part in the proceedings, being the senior member on the committee charged with settling the new constitutional arrangements.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cSpeaker and Cromwellian office-holder\"}} He was supportive of the Protector and was rewarded \u2013 after some agitation on his part \u2013 with a seat in Cromwell's new [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]], taking up his place as Lord Lenthall 10 December 1657.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cSpeaker and Cromwellian office-holder\"}}\n\n===Revival of the Rump Parliament===\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell on 3 September 1658 his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him as Lord Protector. The Protectorate rapidly collapsed, and on 6 May 1659 Lenthall was visited by senior army officers who asked him to help with the revival of the Rump Parliament, and to return as speaker.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cCollapse of the republic and the restoration of monarchy\"}} Lenthall was reluctant to give up his seat in the Other House{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=725}} and pleaded ill health, but when he was bypassed and parliament summoned without his aid he felt himself obliged to resume his role as speaker the following day.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cCollapse of the republic and the restoration of monarchy\"}}\n\nLenthall now presided over a revived parliament of only 78 members{{sfn|Woolrych|2002|p=727}}, and in spite of his parallel role as head of the army, division between parliament and the army deepened.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|loc=\u201cCollapse of the republic and the restoration of monarchy\"}}  On 12 October 1659 the army surrounded and occupied the precincts of the House, and for a night and a day a stand-off with the parliamentary defenders ensued. Lenthall himself was denied access by the blockading soldiers, and had to turn back.

He noted in his memory that he \"never raced home from school and cried\" but earned the respect of his classmates, sometimes by fighting. This taught him \"to always walk tall, and with a certain bearing, so people knew I meant business\".<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In his 2006 memoir, ''Go to School, You're a Little Black Boy'', Alexander recalled: \"Blacks at that time made up a sliver-thin portion of the city's population, and racial prejudice abounded.\" When the family moved to the east end of Toronto, and he attended [[Riverdale Collegiate]], Alexander knew only three Black families. \"The scene in Toronto at that time wasn't violent, though you had to know your place and govern yourself accordingly.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHis family was religious and enjoyed a social life centred on regularly attending a Baptist church in downtown Toronto.

He recalled in his memoir, \"[G]iven the message about education that had been pounded into my head since I was a young child, the fact those kids didn\u2019t go to school was an eye-opener for me.\" As a black community, Harlem allowed him to find role models who worked at jobs that did not involve manual labour.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\n==War record==\nIn 1939, after Canada declared war on Germany, his mother sent him back to Toronto to live with his father. Lincoln met Yvonne (Tody) Harrison at a dance in Toronto. The youngest of four daughters of Robert, a railway porter, and his wife Edythe (n\u00e9e Lewis), Harrison lived in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

While there, he suggested to the Dean during a lecture that he was using inappropriate language: \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Challenging the Dean he said: \"But you can't say that because you have to show leadership.

Two years later Alexander partnered with Dave Duncan, forming the firm Duncan & Alexander, which he claimed was the first inter-racial law partnership in Canada.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/><ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander  bought his own home on Proctor Blvd in the east end of Hamilton in 1958 and was able to move his family out of his in-laws' house. He lived there for nearly four decades.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1960, he and his wife visited twenty-three countries in Africa as volunteers with [[Operation Crossroads Africa]], a trip he said that made him realize: \"In Africa I was a black man and I was somebody.\"<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander wrote in his memoir:\n\n<blockquote>\"The experience was an eye-opener for me not only as a lawyer, but also as a human being, because I began to realize what black people could do.

He joined former McMaster classmate Jack Millar in the firm Millar, Alexander, Tokiwa and Isaacs, which eventually became known as \"the United Nations law firm\".

Bunny was never accepted by Lincoln Sr. and was not allowed in the family's house.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nAlexander went to [[Earl Grey Public School]] where he was the only Black in his kindergarten class. He noted in his memoir that he \"never raced home from school and cried\" but earned the respect of his classmates, sometimes by fighting. This taught him \"to always walk tall, and with a certain bearing, so people knew I meant business\".<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In his 2006 memoir, ''Go to School, You're a Little Black Boy'', Alexander recalled: \"Blacks at that time made up a sliver-thin portion of the city's population, and racial prejudice abounded.\" When the family moved to the east end of Toronto, and he attended [[Riverdale Collegiate]], Alexander knew only three Black families. \"The scene in Toronto at that time wasn't violent, though you had to know your place and govern yourself accordingly.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHis family was religious and enjoyed a social life centred on regularly attending a Baptist church in downtown Toronto. His father was a stern disciplinarian who wanted his son to play the piano. Alexander preferred various sports, including track, soccer, hockey, softball and boxing; he never learned to swim. His size made him uncoordinated so he was not a natural athlete.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nAs a teen Alexander's mother moved to [[Harlem]] with his half-brother Ridley after his father beat her violently. Lincoln and his brother Hughie were cared for by Sadie and Rupert Downes until his mother could send for one of them. She chose Lincoln; Hughie remained with the Downes family and the brothers grew apart.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn New York he attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], the only member of his family to do so. He recalled in his memoir, \"[G]iven the message about education that had been pounded into my head since I was a young child, the fact those kids didn\u2019t go to school was an eye-opener for me.\" As a black community, Harlem allowed him to find role models who worked at jobs that did not involve manual labour.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\n==War record==\nIn 1939, after Canada declared war on Germany, his mother sent him back to Toronto to live with his father. Lincoln met Yvonne (Tody) Harrison at a dance in Toronto. The youngest of four daughters of Robert, a railway porter, and his wife Edythe (n\u00e9e Lewis), Harrison lived in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Alexander was smitten by her and resolved to marry her. Because he was too young to enlist in the armed forces, he took a job as a machinist making anti-aircraft guns at a factory in Hamilton to be close to her.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHe first distinguished himself in service to [[Canada]] in 1942 as a corporal and wireless operator in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He served in many parts of the country including [[Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie|Portage La Prairie]].

He reported the incident to a superior officer who refused to take action.  Alexander quit the Air Force in 1945 and was granted an honourable discharge. Of that incident, he said: \"[A]t that time they didn't know how to deal with race relations of this sort of thing; they just turned a blind eye to it.\"<ref name=\"GovOnLa\"/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nAfter the war Alexander completed his studies at Hamilton's Central Collegiate and then entered [[McMaster University]] in 1946 to study economics and history, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1949.<ref name=globeobit>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Sandra|title=Obituary: Former lieutenant-governor took discrimination as personal challenge|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-former-lieutenant-governor-took-discrimination-as-personal-challenge/article4623578/?page=all|accessdate=October 27, 2012|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=October 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023161925/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-former-lieutenant-governor-took-discrimination-as-personal-challenge/article4623578/?page=all|archivedate=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"CELA\"/>\n\nAt age 25, on September 10, 1948, he married Yvonne \"Tody\" Harrison, five years his senior. Upon graduating in 1949, he applied for a sales job at [[Stelco]], a steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario. Although he had references, the support of McMaster and the mayor of Hamilton, Stelco was unwilling to have a black man on its sales force. He declined their offer of his old summer job working in the plant.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1948, Alexander's mother died at age 49, suffering from dementia; his father committed suicide four years later.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> He married his first wife, Yvonne Harrison, in 1948;<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> their only child, a son Keith, was born in 1949.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In 1986, Alexander said in a ''Chatelaine'' magazine interview: \"My mother was the single biggest influence on me\u2013before my wife, I\u2019ve always regretted that she didn\u2019t live to see me graduate from university.\"<ref name=globeobit/>\n\nAlexander then attended [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in Toronto. While there, he suggested to the Dean during a lecture that he was using inappropriate language: \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Challenging the Dean he said: \"But you can't say that because you have to show leadership. You're in a position of authority, a leader in the community. A leader has to lead and not be using such disrespectful comments without even thinking about them.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> Of the incident he recalled: \"I don't know what ever made me stand up and ask him that in a class of 200 people.&nbsp;... But I will tell you one thing, that day made me a man.\"<ref name=\"GovOnLa\"/> His actions did not end his career as he feared and Alexander graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1953.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/>\n\nAfter [[Articled clerk|articling]] for Sam Gotfrid, Q.C., the only job offer he received was from Helen and Edward Okuloski, a brother and sister who had started their own practice in Hamilton when they were unable to find jobs with existing firms. Here he practiced real estate and commercial law and established a political base in the German and Polish communities in Hamilton. Two years later Alexander partnered with Dave Duncan, forming the firm Duncan & Alexander, which he claimed was the first inter-racial law partnership in Canada.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/><ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander  bought his own home on Proctor Blvd in the east end of Hamilton in 1958 and was able to move his family out of his in-laws' house. He lived there for nearly four decades.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1960, he and his wife visited twenty-three countries in Africa as volunteers with [[Operation Crossroads Africa]], a trip he said that made him realize: \"In Africa I was a black man and I was somebody.\"<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander wrote in his memoir:\n\n<blockquote>\"The experience was an eye-opener for me not only as a lawyer, but also as a human being, because I began to realize what black people could do. I saw that, unlike the Hollywood version, these Africans were men and women of significant talents. I became conscious of my blackness. I had come from a white world. Now we were in Africa, and I realized we are people of skill and creativity. I was a black man and I was a somebody. I started standing tall.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1962, Alexander's partnership with Duncan was dissolved. He joined former McMaster classmate Jack Millar in the firm Millar, Alexander, Tokiwa and Isaacs, which eventually became known as \"the United Nations law firm\". In his memoir, Alexander recalls: \"A Caucasian, a black, Japanese and a Native Canadian. We were white, black, yellow and red, we used to laugh.\" He was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1965.<ref name=\"CELA\">{{cite web|title=Lincoln Alexander|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lincoln-maccauley-alexander|website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nIn 1965, Alexander ran in the Canadian [[1965 Canadian federal election|federal election]] as the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] candidate in the [[Hamilton West (electoral district)|Hamilton West]] [[electoral district]] but was defeated.<ref name=\"CELA\"/> He ran again in the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968 federal election]] and on June 25, 1968, he won the seat, becoming Canada's first [[Black Canadians|black]] [[Member of Parliament]].<ref name=\"CELA\"/>\n\nOn September 20, 1968 he made his maiden speech in the House of Commons saying:<blockquote>I am not the spokesman for the Negro; that honour has not been given to me.

However, I want the record to show that I accept the responsibility of speaking for him and all others in this great nation who feel that they are the subjects of discrimination because of race, creed or colour.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1970, Alexander voted in favour of the ''[[October Crisis|War Measures Act]]'' invoked by then Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] but later felt he had erred in this decision, saying: \"[T]he issue of limiting rights has far more serious implications than I thought at the time.

As an example, he threatened to break ranks with his own party to vote in favour of anti-hate legislation, saying \"screw you\" to his party's argument that it would curtail freedom of speech. \"Are you saying that you can call my son or daughter a nigger and that is free speech?\" he asked during debate on the bill. [[Heath MacQuarrie]], then a Tory MP from Prince Edward Island, stood up and said, \"I'm not going to let Linc stand alone on this.\" Together they led 17 members of their caucus in support of the government's legislation.<ref name=\"School\"/>\n\nIt was Alexander and Newfoundland MP [[John Lundrigan]] who provoked Trudeau into mouthing an obscenity in the House of Commons during a discussion of training programs for the unemployed in February 1971. This quickly became known as the \"[[fuddle duddle]]\" incident.<ref name=\"School\"/>\n\nAlexander was an observer to the [[United Nations]] in 1976 and 1978 and served briefly as [[Minister of Labour (Canada)|Minister of Labour]] in the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]]'s [[minority government]] headed by [[Joe Clark]] from 1979 to 1980.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHe held the seat through four successive elections until resigning his seat on May 27, 1980, when he was asked by then Premier of Ontario [[Bill Davis]] to serve as chairman of the Ontario Worker's Compensation Board.<ref name=\"Star Obit\">{{cite news|last=Wells|first=Jon|title=Lincoln Alexander dies at 90|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1274101--lincoln-alexander-dies-at-90|date=October 20, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=October 21, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023180952/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/10/20/lincoln_alexander_dies_at_90.html|archivedate=23 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"CELA\"/> He misunderstood Davis's request and recalled: \"I said [to the Premier], 'do you think this is going to give you the black vote around here, the vote of the visible minority&nbsp;...?'

([[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]], who was of mixed descent, was Governor of [[Vancouver Island]] and of [[British Columbia]] prior to [[Canadian Confederation]] when these were British colonies with no connection to [[the Canadas]].)\n\nDuring his appointment, he focused attention on multicultural issues, education, racism and youth issues.<ref name=globeobit/><ref name=\"CELA\"/> As [[viceroy]] he visited 672 communities, held 675 receptions, received roughly 75,000 guests, attended 4,000 engagements, and visited 230 schools.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:State funeral for Lincoln Alexander.jpg|thumb|The funeral procession for the state funeral of the Honorable Lincoln Alexander on October 26, 2012, in Hamilton]]\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 at Workers Compensation Board of Ontario, the organization underwent its most extensive legislative overhaul since 1915.
