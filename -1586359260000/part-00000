{"title_page": "Edo period", "text_new": "{{short description|Period of Japanese history}}\n{{History of Japan |periods |image=File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg |caption=}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Edo period'''|\u6c5f\u6238\u6642\u4ee3|Edo jidai}} or {{nihongo|'''Tokugawa period'''|\u5fb3\u5ddd\u6642\u4ee3|Tokugawa jidai}} is the period between 1603 and 1868 in the [[history of Japan]], when Japan was under the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and the country's 300 regional ''[[daimy\u014d]]''. The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policies, a stable population,  \"no more wars\", and popular enjoyment of arts and culture. The shogunate was officially established in [[Edo]] on March 24, 1603, by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. The period came to an end with the [[Meiji Restoration]] on May 3, 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]].\n\n== Consolidation of the shogunate ==\n{{main|Tokugawa shogunate}}\n[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]]]\n\nA [[revolution]] took place from the time of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], which existed with the [[Tenn\u014d]]'s court, to the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], when the ''[[samurai]]'' became the unchallenged rulers   in what historian [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] called a \"centralized [[feudal]]\" form of shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new-existing [[bakufu]] was [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the main beneficiary of the achievements of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] area. He maintained two million ''[[koku]]'' of land, a new headquarters at [[Edo]], a strategically situated castle town (the future [[Tokyo]]), and also had an additional two million ''koku'' of land and thirty-eight [[vassal]]s under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the [[Toyotomi clan]].\n\nIeyasu's victory over the western ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the [[Keich\u014d]] era) gave him control of all [[Japan]]. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy ''daimy\u014d'' houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western ''daimy\u014d'', but his assumption of the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (1579\u20131632) as ''sh\u014dgun'' and himself as retired ''sh\u014dgun'' in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at [[Osaka]].\n\nThe Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call ''bakuhan'', a combination of the terms ''bakufu'' and ''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'' (domains) to describe the government and society of the period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=128\u2013182}}</ref> In the ''bakuhan'', the ''sh\u014dgun'' had national authority and the ''daimy\u014d'' had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of [[centralized]] and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million ''koku'', control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.\n\nThe  feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of ''daimy\u014d''. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the ''[[Shinpan (daimyo)|shinpan]]'', or \"related houses\". They were twenty-three ''daimy\u014d'' on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the ''[[fudai]]'', or \"house ''daimy\u014d''\", rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 ''fudai'' controlled much smaller ''han'', the greatest assessed at 250,000 ''koku''. Members of the ''fudai'' class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven ''han'' formed the third group, the ''[[tozama]]'' (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The ''tozama'' were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million ''koku'' of productive land. Because the ''tozama'' were least trusted of the ''daimy\u014d'', they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central [[government]] positions.\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, they also had unprecedented power over the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], the court, all ''daimy\u014d'' and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the ''sh\u014dgun'', who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.\n\nA code of laws was established to regulate the ''daimy\u014d'' houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (''han'') and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the ''daimy\u014d'' were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for [[military]] and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the ''daimy\u014d'', thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The ''han'', once military-centered domains, became mere local [[Administration (government)|administrative]] units. The ''daimy\u014d'' did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, [[bureaucrat]]s and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.\n\n==Foreign trade relations==\n{{main|Sakoku}}\n[[File:HasekuraWithShipDetail.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|San Juan Bautista]]'' is represented in [[Claude Deruet]]'s painting of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] in Rome in 1617, as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red manji on orange background) on the top mast.]]\n[[File:Hasekura Travels.jpg|thumb|Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga]]\n[[File:Kawahara Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's-eye view of the Nagasaki bay, with the island [[Dejima]] at mid-left (1820). ]]\n\nLike Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.\n\nThe beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]] during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going Western-style [[warships]], such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-[[ton]] [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 720 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], used those ships throughout Asia.\n\nThe \"Christian problem\" was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian ''daimy\u014d'' in Ky\u016bsh\u016b and their trade with the [[Europeans]]. By 1612, the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Ky\u016bsh\u016b), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the [[Closed Country Edict of 1635]] prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636, the Dutch were restricted to [[Dejima]], a small [[artificial island]]\u2014and thus, not true Japanese soil\u2014in Nagasaki's harbor.\n\nThe shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to target it. The [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637\u201338, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu\u2014and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold\u2014marked the end of the Christian movement, although some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians survived by going underground, the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan]]. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Besides small trade of some outer ''daimy\u014d'' with [[Korea]] and the [[Ryukyu Islands]], to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' to Nagasaki.\n\nThe last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by 1644<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=369\u2013370}}</ref> and by the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|p=370}}</ref> Only China, the [[Dutch East India Company]], and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the [[Dejima]] port in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.\n\n==Society==\n{{main|Edo society}}\n[[File:Edo Hibachi.JPG|thumb|The house of the merchant ''([http://www.kcf.or.jp/fukagawa/ Fukagawa Edo Museum])'']]\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social classes during the Edo period ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]).]]\nDuring the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (''[[kuge]]''), together with the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d''. Below them the population was divided into [[Four divisions of society|four classes]] in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (\u8eab\u5206\u5236): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beasley|1972|p=22}}</ref> Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the [[j\u014dkamachi|cities]] that were built around ''daimy\u014d'' [[Japanese castle|castles]], each restricted to their own quarter. Edo society had an elaborate social structure, in which every family knew its place and level of prestige.<ref>John W. Hall, \"Rule by status in Tokugawa Japan.\" ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' 1.1 (1974): 39-49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/133436 online]</ref>\n\nAt the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the [[sh\u014dgun]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The ''daimy\u014d'' comprised about 250 local lords of local \"han\" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.<ref>Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJLtPR_gMtsC&pg=PA225 p 225\u2013230]</ref>\n\nThen came the 400,000 warriors, called \"[[samurai]]\", in numerous grades and degrees. A few upper samurai were eligible for high office; most were foot soldiers (ashigaru). Since there was very little fighting, they became civil servants paid by the daimyo, with minor duties. The samurai were affiliated with senior lords in a well-established chain of command. The shogun had 17,000 samurai retainers; the daimyo each had hundreds. Most lived in modest homes near their lord's headquarters, and lived off of hereditary rights and stipends. Together these high status groups comprised Japan's ruling class making up about 6% of the total population.\n\nAfter a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles of [[social order]]. Most [[samurai]] lost their direct possession of the land: the ''daimy\u014d'' took over their land.  The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the 5,000 so-called ''[[hatamoto]]''. The ''daimy\u014d'' were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the ''daimy\u014d'' themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'') for the next. This system was called ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]''.<ref>Michael Wert, ''Samurai: A Concise History'' (2019).</ref>\n\nLower orders divided into two main segments\u2014the peasants\u201480% of the population\u2014whose high prestige as producers was undercut by their burden as the chief source of taxes. They were illiterate and lived in villages controlled by appointed officials who kept the peace and collected taxes.\nThe family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society.  The individual had no separate legal rights. The 1711 ''Got\u014dke reij\u014d'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nOutside the four classes were the so-called ''[[Burakumin|eta]]'' and ''hinin'', those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. ''Eta'' were butchers, tanners and undertakers. ''Hinin'' served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word ''eta'' literally translates to \"filthy\" and ''hinin'' to \"non-humans\", a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' were not even people.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=313}}</ref> ''Hinin'' were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee-length and the wearing of hats.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> Sometimes ''eta'' villages were not even printed on official maps. A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> In the 19th century the umbrella term ''burakumin'' was coined to name the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=93}}</ref> The ''eta'', ''hinin'' and ''burakumin'' classes were officially abolished in 1871.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continues into modern times.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Edo Panorama old Tokyo color photochrom.jpg|1200px|Edo, 1865 or 1866.

Economic development during the Tokugawa period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, [[Han (administrative division)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.<ref>Kozo Yamamura, \"Toward a reexamination of the economic history of Tokugawa Japan, 1600\u20131867.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 33.3 (1973): 509-546.

Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Japan had almost [[zero population growth]] between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flath|2000}}</ref> Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\n===Economy===\nThe Tokugawa era brought peace, and that brought prosperity to a nation of 31 million, 80% of them rice farmers.  Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable.

In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services.<ref>Conrad Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2nd ed. 2000) ch 11.</ref>\n\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage. The samurai, forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money, borrowed too much. The bakufu and daimyos raised taxes on farmers, but did not tax business, so they too fell into debt. By 1750 rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt.  The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits. The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system, and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government. One solution was reactionary\u2014with prohibitions on spending for luxuries. Other solutions were modernizing, with the goal of increasing agrarian productivity.  The eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune (in office 1716-1745) had considerable success, though much of his work had to be done again between 1787 and 1793 by the shogun's chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759-1829). Others shoguns debased the coinage to pay debts, which caused inflation.\n\nBy 1800 the commercialization of the economy grew rapidly, bringing more and more remote villages into the national economy. Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high-profit commercial crops and engaged in local money-lending, trade, and small-scale manufacturing. Some wealthy merchants sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class.\n\n====Agriculture====\n[[Rice]] was the base of the economy.  About 80% of the people were rice farmers.<ref>Susan B.

Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in Edo. To raise money, the ''daimy\u014d'' used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nIt was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced [[forest management]] policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the ''sh\u014dgun'', beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d'' could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about [[silviculture]] and plantation [[forestry]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|2005|pp=297\u2013304}}</ref>\n\n===Financial services===\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage.

The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the \"Tempo era\" (1830-1843) promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni. He raised taxes, denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business; he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy.<ref>McClain (2002) pp 128-29</ref>\n\n==Artistic and intellectual development==\n[[File:Japanese - Figurine (\"Okimono\") of a Dragon Emerging from Waves - Walters 491733.jpg|thumb|\"Figurine (\"Okimono\") of a Dragon Emerging from Waves\", Japan ca. 19th century]]\n[[File:Le Mus\u00e9e Paul Dupuy - Horloge japonaise \u00e0 double foliot (Wadokei) - P\u00e9riode Edo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wadokei]], Japanese-made clockwatch, 18th century]]\n\nDuring the period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired by Western techniques.\n\nThe flourishing of [[Neo-Confucianism]] was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies had long been kept active in Japan by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the ''[[kokugaku]]'' (national learning) school of thought.\n\nAdvanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the [[rule of law]]. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.\n\nMembers of the [[samurai]] class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. Another special way of life\u2014''ch\u014dnind\u014d''\u2014also emerged. ''[[Ch\u014dnind\u014d]]'' (\"the way of the townspeople\") was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities\u2014diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality\u2014while blending [[Shinto]], neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.\n\nFor the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ''[[ukiyo]]'' (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life.  This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edo's developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune.<ref>{{Harvnb|Longstreet|Longstreet|1989|p=2}}</ref> Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.\n\n[[File:First Japanese treatise on Western anatomy.jpg|thumb|''[[Kaitai Shinsho]]'', Japan's first treatise on Western [[anatomy]], published in 1774]]\n\nYoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving, and other expenses ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts. These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship so that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion, since a woman's identity was determined by her clothing; specifically, it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with women's cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,<ref>{{Harvnb|Seigle|1993|p=17}}</ref> this area became the country's government-sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for about 250 years.\n\nProfessional female entertainers (''[[geisha]]''), music, popular stories, ''[[Kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ''[[ukiyo-e]]''), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653\u20131724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644\u201394).\n\n[[Matsumura Keibun]] is one of the most significant painters of this period. His works commonly included realistic depictions of birds, flowers and animals.<ref name=BMA>{{Harvnb|Birmingham Museum of Art|2010|pp=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', full-colour [[ukiyo-e]] woodblock print, [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1829\u201332}}]]\n\n[[Ukiyo-e]] is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure districts]] of Edo, such as courtesans and [[kabuki]] actors.  [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first full-colour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e.  The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]].  As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies.  Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of [[Japonisme]]<nowiki/> that swept Western art in the late 19th century.\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. [[Buddhism]], together with [[neo-Confucianism]], provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.\n\n[[File:Plan of edo.jpeg|thumb|Scaled pocket plan of Edo]]\n\n[[Shinto]] eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The [[Kojiki]], [[Nihon Shoki]], and [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]] were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as [[Motoori Norinaga]], even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences\u2014in effect, foreign influences\u2014for contaminating Japan's ancient ways.

For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-ch\u014d was invented during this time<ref>{{Cite book|title = Song, dance, storytelling: aspects of the performing arts in Japan|url = https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff|url-access = registration|publisher = China-Japan Program, Cornell University|date = 1978-06-01|language = en|first = Frank|last = Hoff|page = [https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff/page/130 130]}}</ref> and is still used today in folk songs.  Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened.  Several different types of [[kabuki]] (theater) emerged.  Some, such as [[shibaraku]], were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles.  Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Edo Culture: Daily Life and Diversions in Urban Japan, 1600\u20131868|last = Nishiyama|first = Matsunosuke|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 198\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 03.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[uchikake]]}}), 1840\u20131870, [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\n=== Fashion ===\nThe Edo period introduced a wide variety of designs and decorative techniques, especially for kimono worn by women.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=8}} The main consumers of kimono were the [[samurai]] who used lavish clothing and other material luxuries to signal their place at the top of the social order.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Driven by this [[demand]], the textile industry grew and used increasingly sophisticated methods of weaving, [[dyeing]], and [[embroidery]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Over this period, women adopted brighter colours and bolder designs, whereas women's and men's kimono had been very similar.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=22}} The rise of a [[Bourgeoisie|merchant class]] fuelled more demand for elaborate costumes.

The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan's opening to the world by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], whose [[Naval fleet|armada]] (known by Japanese as \"[[Black Ships|the black ships]]\") fired weapons from [[Edo Bay]]. Several [[artificial island|artificial land masses]] were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the [[Odaiba]] district.\n\nThe Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'' and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-''bakufu'' movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was \"poor management of the central government by the ''sh\u014dgun'', which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart\".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|2002|pp=289\u2013292}}</ref> From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families' accumulation of wealth and fostered a \"back to the soil\" policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.\n\nDespite these efforts to restrict wealth and partly because of the extraordinary period of peace, the standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the [[samurai]] and ''[[ch\u014dnin]]'' classes. Despite the reappearance of [[guild]]s, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and [[loan]]s. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the ''ch\u014dnin'' took place.\n\nA struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the ''sh\u014dgun'' imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an [[agrarian society]] failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.<ref>{{Citation|last=Turkington|first=David|author-link=David Turkington|title=A Chronology of Japanese History|work=Edo Period (1603-1868)|url=http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|accessdate=May 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625110809/http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|archive-date=June 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.\n\nAlthough Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime.\n\nWestern intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on [[Karafuto]] (called [[Sakhalin]] under Russian and Soviet control) and on the [[Kuril Islands]], the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and [[whaler]]s were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan's shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. ''[[Rangaku]]'' became crucial not only in understanding the foreign \"[[barbarian]]s\" but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.\n\nBy the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and [[natural disaster]]s hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of ''rangaku'', censorship of literature, and elimination of \"luxury\" in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The ''bakufu'' persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the [[First Opium War]] of 1839\u20131842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.\n\nJapan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations when [[James Biddle (commodore)|Commodore James Biddle]] appeared in [[Edo Bay]] with two warships in July 1846.\n\n===End of seclusion===\n[[File:Matthew Calbraith Perry.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Calbraith Perry]]]]\n[[File:Commodore-Perry-Visit-Kanagawa-1854.jpg|thumb|Landing of Commodore Perry, Officers and Men of the Squadron To meet the Imperial Commissioners at ''Kurihama [[Yokosuka]]'' March 8th, 1854]]\n\nWhen Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, [[Abe Masahiro]] (1819\u20131857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to [[national security]], Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or [[Treaty of Kanagawa]]) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], a seaport on the [[Izu Peninsula]], southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the ''bakufu'' five years later.\n\nThe resulting damage to the ''bakufu'' was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=51}}</ref> The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the ''bakufu''. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the ''fudai'', had consulted with the ''shinpan'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d'', further undermining the already weakened ''bakufu''. In the [[Ansei Reform]] (1854\u20131856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within ''[[fudai]]'' circles, which opposed opening ''bakufu'' councils to ''tozama daimy\u014d'', and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by [[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810\u20131864).\n\nAt the head of the dissident faction was [[Tokugawa Nariaki]], who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school\u2014based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles\u2014had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine [[Yamato dynasty]].\n\nIn the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key ''daimy\u014d'', and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the ''bakufu'', rejected Hotta's request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the ''sh\u014dgun'' died without an [[heir]], Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (or Keiki), for ''sh\u014dgun'', a candidate favored by the ''[[shinpan]]'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d''. The ''fudai'' won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing [[Yoshida Sh\u014din]] (1830\u20131859), a leading ''sonn\u014d-j\u014di'' intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu), and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.\n\nRecently{{when|date=November 2016}} some scholars{{who|date=November 2016}} have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. From 1716 to 1745 Yoshimune (eighth Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'' from 1716\u20131745) started the first [[Ky\u014dh\u014d reforms]] in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=42}}</ref> In 1767, to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the [[Kansei Reforms]] in 1787\u20131793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> The final economic reform of the [[Tenp\u014d]] era of 1841\u20131843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silk worms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane's School of National Learning:\n<poem>\n\"It is disgusting\nthe agitation over thread\nIn today's world\nEver since the ships\nfrom foreign countries\ncame for the jeweled\nsilkworm cocoons\nto the land of the gods and the Emperor\nPeoples hearts\nawesome though they are,\nare being pulled apart\nand consumed by rage.\"</poem><ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=52}}</ref> This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\" />\n[[File:Yoshinobu Tokugawa 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in later life]]\n[[File:Kanrinmaru.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']], Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, 1855]]\n\n===Bakumatsu modernization and conflicts===\n[[File:WesternizedSamurai1866.jpg|thumb|Samurai in western clothing of the Tokugawa Shogunate Army (1866).]]\n{{main|Bakumatsu}}\n\nDuring the last years of the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'', or ''[[bakumatsu]]'', the ''bakufu'' took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of [[anti-Western sentiment]] throughout the country.\n\nThe army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in [[Nagasaki]] in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as [[Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the ''sh\u014dgun'' already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiyo Maru|''Kaiy\u014d Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]] under the command of Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. A [[Jules Brunet|French military mission]] was established to help modernize the armies of the ''bakufu''.\n\nRevering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the [[Anglo-Satsuma War]] led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A ''bakufu'' army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]]s in 1866. Finally, in 1867, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] died and was succeeded by his underaged son [[Emperor Meiji]].\n\n[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and ''sh\u014dgun''. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b ''daimy\u014d'', other ''daimy\u014d'' called for returning the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s political power to the emperor and a council of ''daimy\u014d'' chaired by the former Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun''. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an \"imperial restoration\". The Satsuma, Ch\u014dsh\u016b, and other ''han'' leaders and radical courtiers, however, [[rebellion|rebelled]], seized the [[Japanese imperial palace|imperial palace]], and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.\n\nFollowing the [[Boshin War]] (1868\u20131869), the ''bakufu'' was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common ''daimy\u014d''. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the ''bakufu'' [[navy|naval forces]] under Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] continued to hold out for another six months in [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they founded the short-lived [[Republic of Ezo]].\n\n==Events==\n* 1600: [[Battle of Sekigahara]].

The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policies, a stable population,  \"no more wars\", and popular enjoyment of arts and culture. The shogunate was officially established in [[Edo]] on March 24, 1603, by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. The period came to an end with the [[Meiji Restoration]] on May 3, 1868, after the [[fall of Edo]].\n\n== Consolidation of the shogunate ==\n{{main|Tokugawa shogunate}}\n[[File:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], first ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]]]\n\nA [[revolution]] took place from the time of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], which existed with the [[Tenn\u014d]]'s court, to the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], when the ''[[samurai]]'' became the unchallenged rulers   in what historian [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] called a \"centralized [[feudal]]\" form of shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new-existing [[bakufu]] was [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], the main beneficiary of the achievements of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d]] area. He maintained two million ''[[koku]]'' of land, a new headquarters at [[Edo]], a strategically situated castle town (the future [[Tokyo]]), and also had an additional two million ''koku'' of land and thirty-eight [[vassal]]s under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the [[Toyotomi clan]].\n\nIeyasu's victory over the western ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the [[Keich\u014d]] era) gave him control of all [[Japan]]. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy ''daimy\u014d'' houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western ''daimy\u014d'', but his assumption of the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son [[Tokugawa Hidetada|Hidetada]] (1579\u20131632) as ''sh\u014dgun'' and himself as retired ''sh\u014dgun'' in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at [[Osaka]].\n\nThe Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call ''bakuhan'', a combination of the terms ''bakufu'' and ''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'' (domains) to describe the government and society of the period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=128\u2013182}}</ref> In the ''bakuhan'', the ''sh\u014dgun'' had national authority and the ''daimy\u014d'' had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of [[centralized]] and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million ''koku'', control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.\n\nThe  feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of ''daimy\u014d''. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the ''[[Shinpan (daimyo)|shinpan]]'', or \"related houses\". They were twenty-three ''daimy\u014d'' on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the ''[[fudai]]'', or \"house ''daimy\u014d''\", rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 ''fudai'' controlled much smaller ''han'', the greatest assessed at 250,000 ''koku''. Members of the ''fudai'' class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven ''han'' formed the third group, the ''[[tozama]]'' (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The ''tozama'' were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million ''koku'' of productive land. Because the ''tozama'' were least trusted of the ''daimy\u014d'', they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central [[government]] positions.\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, they also had unprecedented power over the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]], the court, all ''daimy\u014d'' and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the ''sh\u014dgun'', who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.\n\nA code of laws was established to regulate the ''daimy\u014d'' houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]'' system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (''han'') and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the ''daimy\u014d'' were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for [[military]] and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the ''daimy\u014d'', thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The ''han'', once military-centered domains, became mere local [[Administration (government)|administrative]] units. The ''daimy\u014d'' did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, [[bureaucrat]]s and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.\n\n==Foreign trade relations==\n{{main|Sakoku}}\n[[File:HasekuraWithShipDetail.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|San Juan Bautista]]'' is represented in [[Claude Deruet]]'s painting of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] in Rome in 1617, as a galleon with Hasekura's flag (red manji on orange background) on the top mast.]]\n[[File:Hasekura Travels.jpg|thumb|Itinerary and dates of the travels of Hasekura Tsunenaga]]\n[[File:Kawahara Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's-eye view of the Nagasaki bay, with the island [[Dejima]] at mid-left (1820). ]]\n\nLike Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.\n\nThe beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the [[Nanban trade period]] during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going Western-style [[warships]], such as the [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], a 500-[[ton]] [[galleon]]-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the ''bakufu'' commissioned around 720 [[Red Seal Ships]], three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as [[Yamada Nagamasa]], used those ships throughout Asia.\n\nThe \"Christian problem\" was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian ''daimy\u014d'' in Ky\u016bsh\u016b and their trade with the [[Europeans]]. By 1612, the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Ky\u016bsh\u016b), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the [[Closed Country Edict of 1635]] prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636, the Dutch were restricted to [[Dejima]], a small [[artificial island]]\u2014and thus, not true Japanese soil\u2014in Nagasaki's harbor.\n\nThe shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to target it. The [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637\u201338, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu\u2014and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold\u2014marked the end of the Christian movement, although some [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians survived by going underground, the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan]]. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Besides small trade of some outer ''daimy\u014d'' with [[Korea]] and the [[Ryukyu Islands]], to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of ''[[sakoku]]'' to Nagasaki.\n\nThe last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by 1644<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|pp=369\u2013370}}</ref> and by the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hall|McClain|1991|p=370}}</ref> Only China, the [[Dutch East India Company]], and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the [[Dejima]] port in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.\n\n==Society==\n{{main|Edo society}}\n[[File:Edo Hibachi.JPG|thumb|The house of the merchant ''([http://www.kcf.or.jp/fukagawa/ Fukagawa Edo Museum])'']]\n[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|Social classes during the Edo period ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]).]]\nDuring the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (''[[kuge]]''), together with the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d''. Below them the population was divided into [[Four divisions of society|four classes]] in a system known as ''mibunsei'' (\u8eab\u5206\u5236): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beasley|1972|p=22}}</ref> Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the [[j\u014dkamachi|cities]] that were built around ''daimy\u014d'' [[Japanese castle|castles]], each restricted to their own quarter. Edo society had an elaborate social structure, in which every family knew its place and level of prestige.<ref>John W. Hall, \"Rule by status in Tokugawa Japan.\" ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' 1.1 (1974): 39-49. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/133436 online]</ref>\n\nAt the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the [[sh\u014dgun]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The ''daimy\u014d'' comprised about 250 local lords of local \"han\" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.<ref>Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJLtPR_gMtsC&pg=PA225 p 225\u2013230]</ref>\n\nThen came the 400,000 warriors, called \"[[samurai]]\", in numerous grades and degrees. A few upper samurai were eligible for high office; most were foot soldiers (ashigaru). Since there was very little fighting, they became civil servants paid by the daimyo, with minor duties. The samurai were affiliated with senior lords in a well-established chain of command. The shogun had 17,000 samurai retainers; the daimyo each had hundreds. Most lived in modest homes near their lord's headquarters, and lived off of hereditary rights and stipends. Together these high status groups comprised Japan's ruling class making up about 6% of the total population.\n\nAfter a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles of [[social order]]. Most [[samurai]] lost their direct possession of the land: the ''daimy\u014d'' took over their land.  The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the ''sh\u014dgun'', the 5,000 so-called ''[[hatamoto]]''. The ''daimy\u014d'' were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the ''daimy\u014d'' themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (''[[Han (administrative division)|han]]'') for the next. This system was called ''[[sankin-k\u014dtai]]''.<ref>Michael Wert, ''Samurai: A Concise History'' (2019).</ref>\n\nLower orders divided into two main segments\u2014the peasants\u201480% of the population\u2014whose high prestige as producers was undercut by their burden as the chief source of taxes. They were illiterate and lived in villages controlled by appointed officials who kept the peace and collected taxes.\nThe family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society.  The individual had no separate legal rights. The 1711 ''Got\u014dke reij\u014d'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nOutside the four classes were the so-called ''[[Burakumin|eta]]'' and ''hinin'', those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. ''Eta'' were butchers, tanners and undertakers. ''Hinin'' served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word ''eta'' literally translates to \"filthy\" and ''hinin'' to \"non-humans\", a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' were not even people.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=313}}</ref> ''Hinin'' were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city.

A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> In the 19th century the umbrella term ''burakumin'' was coined to name the ''eta'' and ''hinin'' because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\">{{harvnb|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|2002|p=93}}</ref> The ''eta'', ''hinin'' and ''burakumin'' classes were officially abolished in 1871.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 313\"/> However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continues into modern times.<ref name=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric 2002 93\"/>\n\n{{wide image|Edo Panorama old Tokyo color photochrom.jpg|1200px|Edo, 1865 or 1866.

Economic development during the Tokugawa period included [[urbanization]], increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and [[handicraft]] industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, [[Han (administrative division)|''han'']] authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.<ref>Kozo Yamamura, \"Toward a reexamination of the economic history of Tokugawa Japan, 1600\u20131867.\" ''Journal of Economic History'' 33.3 (1973): 509-546.

Many other [[castle town]]s grew as well. Japan had almost [[zero population growth]] between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flath|2000}}</ref> Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\n\n===Economy===\nThe Tokugawa era brought peace, and that brought prosperity to a nation of 31 million, 80% of them rice farmers.  Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable.

In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services.<ref>Conrad Totman, ''A History of Japan'' (2nd ed. 2000) ch 11.</ref>\n\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage. The samurai, forbidden to engage in farming or business but allowed to borrow money, borrowed too much. The bakufu and daimyos raised taxes on farmers, but did not tax business, so they too fell into debt. By 1750 rising taxes incited peasant unrest and even revolt.  The nation had to deal somehow with samurai impoverishment and treasury deficits. The financial troubles of the samurai undermined their loyalties to the system, and the empty treasury threatened the whole system of government. One solution was reactionary\u2014with prohibitions on spending for luxuries. Other solutions were modernizing, with the goal of increasing agrarian productivity.  The eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune (in office 1716-1745) had considerable success, though much of his work had to be done again between 1787 and 1793 by the shogun's chief councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759-1829). Others shoguns debased the coinage to pay debts, which caused inflation.\n\nBy 1800 the commercialization of the economy grew rapidly, bringing more and more remote villages into the national economy. Rich farmers appeared who switched from rice to high-profit commercial crops and engaged in local money-lending, trade, and small-scale manufacturing. Some wealthy merchants sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class.\n\n====Agriculture====\n[[Rice]] was the base of the economy.  About 80% of the people were rice farmers.<ref>Susan B.

Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the ''[[fudasashi]]'' market in Edo. To raise money, the ''daimy\u014d'' used [[forward contract]]s to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern [[futures trading]].\n\nIt was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced [[forest management]] policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the ''sh\u014dgun'', beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the ''sh\u014dgun'' and ''daimy\u014d'' could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about [[silviculture]] and plantation [[forestry]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|2005|pp=297\u2013304}}</ref>\n\n===Financial services===\nThe merchants benefited enormously, especially those with official patronage.

Some wealthy merchants sought higher social status by using money to marry into the samurai class.\n\nA few domains, notably Ch\u014ds\u016b and Satsuma, used innovative methods to restore their finances, but most sunk further into debt.  The financial crisis provoked a reactionary solution near the end of the \"Tempo era\" (1830-1843) promulgated by the chief counselor Mizuno Tadakuni. He raised taxes, denounced luxuries and tried to impede the growth of business; he failed and it appeared to many that the continued existence of the entire Tokugawa system was in jeopardy.<ref>McClain (2002) pp 128-29</ref>\n\n==Artistic and intellectual development==\n[[File:Japanese - Figurine (\"Okimono\") of a Dragon Emerging from Waves - Walters 491733.jpg|thumb|\"Figurine (\"Okimono\") of a Dragon Emerging from Waves\", Japan ca. 19th century]]\n[[File:Le Mus\u00e9e Paul Dupuy - Horloge japonaise \u00e0 double foliot (Wadokei) - P\u00e9riode Edo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wadokei]], Japanese-made clockwatch, 18th century]]\n\nDuring the period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (called ''[[rangaku]]'', \"Dutch studies\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in [[Dejima]]. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or [[wadokei]], inspired by Western techniques.\n\nThe flourishing of [[Neo-Confucianism]] was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies had long been kept active in Japan by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical [[humanism]], [[rationalism]], and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the ''[[kokugaku]]'' (national learning) school of thought.\n\nAdvanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the [[rule of law]]. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.\n\nMembers of the [[samurai]] class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. Another special way of life\u2014''ch\u014dnind\u014d''\u2014also emerged. ''[[Ch\u014dnind\u014d]]'' (\"the way of the townspeople\") was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as [[Osaka]], [[Kyoto]], and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities\u2014diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality\u2014while blending [[Shinto]], neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.\n\nFor the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ''[[ukiyo]]'' (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life.  This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edo's developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune.<ref>{{Harvnb|Longstreet|Longstreet|1989|p=2}}</ref> Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.\n\n[[File:First Japanese treatise on Western anatomy.jpg|thumb|''[[Kaitai Shinsho]]'', Japan's first treatise on Western [[anatomy]], published in 1774]]\n\nYoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving, and other expenses ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts. These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship so that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion, since a woman's identity was determined by her clothing; specifically, it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with women's cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,<ref>{{Harvnb|Seigle|1993|p=17}}</ref> this area became the country's government-sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for about 250 years.\n\nProfessional female entertainers (''[[geisha]]''), music, popular stories, ''[[Kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ''[[ukiyo-e]]''), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653\u20131724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644\u201394).\n\n[[Matsumura Keibun]] is one of the most significant painters of this period. His works commonly included realistic depictions of birds, flowers and animals.<ref name=BMA>{{Harvnb|Birmingham Museum of Art|2010|pp=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', full-colour [[ukiyo-e]] woodblock print, [[Hokusai]], {{circa|1829\u201332}}]]\n\n[[Ukiyo-e]] is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure districts]] of Edo, such as courtesans and [[kabuki]] actors.  [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first full-colour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e.  The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as [[Torii Kiyonaga|Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]].  As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].  The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies.  Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of [[Japonisme]]<nowiki/> that swept Western art in the late 19th century.\n\n[[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. [[Buddhism]], together with [[neo-Confucianism]], provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.\n\n[[File:Plan of edo.jpeg|thumb|Scaled pocket plan of Edo]]\n\n[[Shinto]] eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The [[Kojiki]], [[Nihon Shoki]], and [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]] were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as [[Motoori Norinaga]], even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences\u2014in effect, foreign influences\u2014for contaminating Japan's ancient ways. Japan was the land of the [[kami]] and, as such, had a special destiny.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2003|pp=45\u201347}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n\nThe Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments (despite termination of contact with the outside world) and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment.  For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-ch\u014d was invented during this time<ref>{{Cite book|title = Song, dance, storytelling: aspects of the performing arts in Japan|url = https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff|url-access = registration|publisher = China-Japan Program, Cornell University|date = 1978-06-01|language = en|first = Frank|last = Hoff|page = [https://archive.org/details/songdancestoryte0000hoff/page/130 130]}}</ref> and is still used today in folk songs.  Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened.  Several different types of [[kabuki]] (theater) emerged.  Some, such as [[shibaraku]], were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles.  Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Edo Culture: Daily Life and Diversions in Urban Japan, 1600\u20131868|last = Nishiyama|first = Matsunosuke|publisher = University of Hawai'i Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 198\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 03.jpg|thumb|right|Outer kimono for a young woman ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[uchikake]]}}), 1840\u20131870, [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\n=== Fashion ===\nThe Edo period introduced a wide variety of designs and decorative techniques, especially for kimono worn by women.{{sfn|Iwao|2015|p=8}} The main consumers of kimono were the [[samurai]] who used lavish clothing and other material luxuries to signal their place at the top of the social order.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Driven by this [[demand]], the textile industry grew and used increasingly sophisticated methods of weaving, [[dyeing]], and [[embroidery]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=20}} Over this period, women adopted brighter colours and bolder designs, whereas women's and men's kimono had been very similar.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=22}} The rise of a [[Bourgeoisie|merchant class]] fuelled more demand for elaborate costumes.

The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan's opening to the world by [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], whose [[Naval fleet|armada]] (known by Japanese as \"[[Black Ships|the black ships]]\") fired weapons from [[Edo Bay]]. Several [[artificial island|artificial land masses]] were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the [[Odaiba]] district.\n\nThe Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'' and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-''bakufu'' movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was \"poor management of the central government by the ''sh\u014dgun'', which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart\".{{attribution needed|date=February 2018}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|2002|pp=289\u2013292}}</ref> From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families' accumulation of wealth and fostered a \"back to the soil\" policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.\n\nDespite these efforts to restrict wealth and partly because of the extraordinary period of peace, the standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the [[samurai]] and ''[[ch\u014dnin]]'' classes. Despite the reappearance of [[guild]]s, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and [[loan]]s. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the ''ch\u014dnin'' took place.\n\nA struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the ''sh\u014dgun'' imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an [[agrarian society]] failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.<ref>{{Citation|last=Turkington|first=David|author-link=David Turkington|title=A Chronology of Japanese History|work=Edo Period (1603-1868)|url=http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|accessdate=May 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625110809/http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/edohistory.html|archive-date=June 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.\n\nAlthough Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime.\n\nWestern intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on [[Karafuto]] (called [[Sakhalin]] under Russian and Soviet control) and on the [[Kuril Islands]], the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of [[Hokkaid\u014d]]. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and [[whaler]]s were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan's shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. ''[[Rangaku]]'' became crucial not only in understanding the foreign \"[[barbarian]]s\" but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.\n\nBy the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and [[natural disaster]]s hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of ''rangaku'', censorship of literature, and elimination of \"luxury\" in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of ''[[sonn\u014d j\u014di]]'' (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The ''bakufu'' persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the [[First Opium War]] of 1839\u20131842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.\n\nJapan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations when [[James Biddle (commodore)|Commodore James Biddle]] appeared in [[Edo Bay]] with two warships in July 1846.\n\n===End of seclusion===\n[[File:Matthew Calbraith Perry.jpg|thumb|[[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Calbraith Perry]]]]\n[[File:Commodore-Perry-Visit-Kanagawa-1854.jpg|thumb|Landing of Commodore Perry, Officers and Men of the Squadron To meet the Imperial Commissioners at ''Kurihama [[Yokosuka]]'' March 8th, 1854]]\n\nWhen Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, [[Abe Masahiro]] (1819\u20131857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to [[national security]], Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or [[Treaty of Kanagawa]]) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], a seaport on the [[Izu Peninsula]], southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the ''bakufu'' five years later.\n\nThe resulting damage to the ''bakufu'' was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=51}}</ref> The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p51\" /> Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the ''bakufu''. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the ''fudai'', had consulted with the ''shinpan'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d'', further undermining the already weakened ''bakufu''. In the [[Ansei Reform]] (1854\u20131856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within ''[[fudai]]'' circles, which opposed opening ''bakufu'' councils to ''tozama daimy\u014d'', and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by [[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810\u20131864).\n\nAt the head of the dissident faction was [[Tokugawa Nariaki]], who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito school\u2014based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles\u2014had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine [[Yamato dynasty]].\n\nIn the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key ''daimy\u014d'', and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the ''bakufu'', rejected Hotta's request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the ''sh\u014dgun'' died without an [[heir]], Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (or Keiki), for ''sh\u014dgun'', a candidate favored by the ''[[shinpan]]'' and ''tozama daimy\u014d''. The ''fudai'' won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing [[Yoshida Sh\u014din]] (1830\u20131859), a leading ''sonn\u014d-j\u014di'' intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu), and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.\n\nRecently{{when|date=November 2016}} some scholars{{who|date=November 2016}} have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. From 1716 to 1745 Yoshimune (eighth Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'' from 1716\u20131745) started the first [[Ky\u014dh\u014d reforms]] in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=42}}</ref> In 1767, to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the [[Kansei Reforms]] in 1787\u20131793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p42\" /> The final economic reform of the [[Tenp\u014d]] era of 1841\u20131843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silk worms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane's School of National Learning:\n<poem>\n\"It is disgusting\nthe agitation over thread\nIn today's world\nEver since the ships\nfrom foreign countries\ncame for the jeweled\nsilkworm cocoons\nto the land of the gods and the Emperor\nPeoples hearts\nawesome though they are,\nare being pulled apart\nand consumed by rage.\"</poem><ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2008|p=52}}</ref> This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.<ref name=\"Gordon2008p52\" />\n[[File:Yoshinobu Tokugawa 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] in later life]]\n[[File:Kanrinmaru.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']], Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, 1855]]\n\n===Bakumatsu modernization and conflicts===\n[[File:WesternizedSamurai1866.jpg|thumb|Samurai in western clothing of the Tokugawa Shogunate Army (1866).]]\n{{main|Bakumatsu}}\n\nDuring the last years of the ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|bakufu]]'', or ''[[bakumatsu]]'', the ''bakufu'' took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of [[anti-Western sentiment]] throughout the country.\n\nThe army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in [[Nagasaki]] in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as [[Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the ''sh\u014dgun'' already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiyo Maru|''Kaiy\u014d Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]] under the command of Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. A [[Jules Brunet|French military mission]] was established to help modernize the armies of the ''bakufu''.\n\nRevering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the [[Anglo-Satsuma War]] led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A ''bakufu'' army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]]s in 1866. Finally, in 1867, [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] died and was succeeded by his underaged son [[Emperor Meiji]].\n\n[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and ''sh\u014dgun''. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Ch\u014dsh\u016b ''daimy\u014d'', other ''daimy\u014d'' called for returning the ''sh\u014dgun''{{'}}s political power to the emperor and a council of ''daimy\u014d'' chaired by the former Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun''. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an \"imperial restoration\". The Satsuma, Ch\u014dsh\u016b, and other ''han'' leaders and radical courtiers, however, [[rebellion|rebelled]], seized the [[Japanese imperial palace|imperial palace]], and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.\n\nFollowing the [[Boshin War]] (1868\u20131869), the ''bakufu'' was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common ''daimy\u014d''. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the ''bakufu'' [[navy|naval forces]] under Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] continued to hold out for another six months in [[Hokkaid\u014d]], where they founded the short-lived [[Republic of Ezo]].\n\n==Events==\n* 1600: [[Battle of Sekigahara]].

Davis was a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He had also been a [[United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]] and [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] under President [[Franklin Pierce]]. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the Confederate government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where South Carolina state militia besieged [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston harbor, held by a small [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] garrison. By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army.\n\nAn accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men. This does not include an unknown number of [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons.<ref>Records of the number of individuals who served in the [[United States Army]] are more extensive and reliable, but still are not entirely accurate. Estimates of the number of individual Union soldiers range between 1,550,000 and 2,400,000, with a number between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 most likely. Union Army records show slightly more than 2,677,000 enlistments but this number apparently includes many re-enlistments. These numbers do not include sailors who served in [[United States Navy]] or [[United States Marine Corps]]. These figures represent the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, not the size of the army at any given date.</ref> Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the army at any given date. These numbers do not include men who served in [[Confederate States Navy]].\n\nAlthough most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription, primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer. In the absence of exact records, estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts.<ref>Albert Burton Moore, ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' (1924).</ref>\n\nConfederate casualty figures also are incomplete and unreliable. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers are about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in United States prison camps. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026. These numbers do not include men who died from other causes such as accidents, which would add several thousand to the death toll.<ref>In comparison, the best estimates of the number of deaths of United States soldiers are 110,100 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 224,580 deaths from disease and 30,192 deaths in Confederate prison camps, although some historians also dispute these figures. The best conjecture for United States Army wounded is 275,175.</ref>\n\nThe main Confederate armies, the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] under [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] and the remnants of the [[Army of Tennessee]] and various other units under General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], surrendered to the U.S. on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12), and April 18, 1865 (officially April 26). Other Confederate forces surrendered between April 16, 1865, and June 28, 1865.<ref>Confederate forces at [[Mobile, Alabama]], and [[Columbus, Georgia]], also had already surrendered on April 14, 1865, and April 16, 1865, respectively. U.S. and Confederate units fought a [[Battle of Columbus (1865)|battle at Columbus, Georgia]], before the surrender on April 16, 1865, and a small final battle at [[Battle of Palmito Ranch|Palmito Ranch]], Texas, on May 12, 1865. In areas more distant from the main theaters of operations, Confederate forces in Alabama and Mississippi under [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], in Arkansas under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[M. Jeff Thompson]], in Louisiana and Texas under General [[E. Kirby Smith]] and in [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] under Brigadier General [[Stand Watie]] surrendered on May 4, 1865, May 12, 1865, May 26, 1865 (officially June 2, 1865), and June 28, 1865, respectively.</ref> By the end of the war, more than 100,000 Confederate soldiers had deserted,<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Foner|title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwVkgrvctCcC&pg=PA15|year=1988|page=15|isbn=9780062035868}}</ref> and some estimates put the number as high as one third of Confederate soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamner |first1=Christopher |title=Deserters in the Civil War {{!}} Teachinghistory.org |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23934 |website=teachinghistory.org |accessdate=3 August 2018 |ref=Historian Christopher Hamner teaches at George Mason University, serves as Editor-in-Chief of Papers of the War Department, 1784\u20131800, and is the author of Enduring Battle: American Soldiers in Three Wars, 1776\u20131945. |language=en}}</ref> The Confederacy's government effectively dissolved when it fled Richmond in April and exerted no control over the remaining armies.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy the time [[Abraham Lincoln]] took office as [[President of the United States]] on March 4, 1861, the seven seceding slave states had formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]].

It was to consist of a large provisional force to exist only in time of war and a small permanent regular army. The provisional, volunteer army was established by an act of the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] passed on February 28, 1861, one week before the act which established the permanent regular army organization, passed on March 6. Although the two forces were to exist concurrently, little was done to organize the Confederate regular army.<ref name=\"Allardice2008\">{{cite book|author=Bruce S.

Virtually all regular, volunteer, and conscripted men preferred to enter this organization since officers could achieve a higher rank in the Provisional Army than they could in the Regular Army. If the war had ended successfully for them, the Confederates intended that the PACS would be disbanded, leaving only the ACSA.<ref name=\"Eicher7066\"/>\n* The '''Army of the Confederate States of America''' ('''ACSA''') was the regular army and was authorized to include 15,015 men, including 744 officers, but this level was never achieved. The men serving in the highest rank as Confederate States generals, such as [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] and [[Robert E. Lee]], were enrolled in the ACSA to ensure that they outranked all militia officers.<ref name=Eicher7066/> ACSA ultimately existed only on paper. The organization of the ACSA did not proceed beyond the appointment and confirmation of some officers. Three state regiments were later denominated \"Confederate\" regiments but this appears to have had no practical effect on the organization of a regular Confederate Army and no real effect on the regiments themselves.\n\nMembers of all the [[military forces of the Confederate States]] (the army, the navy, and the marine corps) are often referred to as \"Confederates\", and members of the Confederate army were referred to as \"Confederate soldiers\". Supplementing the Confederate army were the various state militias of the Confederacy:\n* Confederate States '''State Militias''' were organized and commanded by the state governments, similar to those authorized by the United States' [[Militia Act of 1792]].\n\n===Control and conscription===\n{{Main|Confederate Conscription Acts 1862-1864}}\n[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|left|A cartoon from the war, showing the Confederates forcibly drafting a Unionist man into the Confederate army.

Lee, [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], [[James Longstreet]]) and even President Jefferson Davis, were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers who had been opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession, but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They felt that they had no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated to hear of such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it.\n\n===Personnel organization===\nAs in the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]], the Confederate Army's soldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\n\nAlthough fewer soldiers might comprise a squad or platoon, the smallest [[Infantry in the American Civil War|infantry maneuver unit]] in the Army was a company of 100 soldiers. Ten companies were organized into an infantry regiment, which theoretically had 1,000 men. In reality, as disease, desertions and casualties took their toll, and the common practice of sending replacements to form new regiments took hold, most regiments were greatly reduced in strength. By the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300\u2013400 men, with Confederate units slightly smaller on average than their U.S. counterparts. For example, at the pivotal [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], the average U.S. Army infantry regiment's strength was 433 men, versus 409 for Confederate infantry regiments.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaltimesi00faus|title=Historical times illustrated encyclopedia of the Civil War|date=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|others=Faust, Patricia L., Delaney, Norman C., Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana (Mississippi State University.

They were generally referred by number and state, for example [[1st Texas Infantry|1st Texas]], [[12th Virginia Infantry|12th Virginia]]. To the extent the word \"[[battalion]]\" was used to describe a military unit, it referred to a multi-company task force of a regiment or a near-regimental size unit. Throughout the war, the Confederacy raised the equivalent of 1,010 regiments in all branches, including militias, versus 2,050 regiments for the U.S. Army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Civil War dictionary|last=1921\u2013|first=Boatner, Mark Mayo|date=1959|publisher=D.

Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually formed a [[Division (military)|division]]. Two to four divisions usually formed a [[corps]]. Two to four corps usually formed an army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently as if it were a small army. The Confederate States Army consisted of several field armies, named after their primary area of operation. The largest Confederate field army was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], whose surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]] in 1865 marked the end of major combat operations in the US Civil War.\n\n[[Company (military unit)|Companies]] were commanded by captains and had two or more lieutenants. Regiments were commanded by colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a lower grade officer. Barring the same type of circumstances which might leave a lower grade officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Corporal Artillery CS Army.jpg|Corporal of the Artillery division of the Confederate Army\nFile:AdamJSlemmerinConfederateBatteryAtWarringtonAcrossFromFortPickens1861.jpg|Confederate mortar crew at Warrington, Florida in 1861, across from Fort Pickens\nFile:ArtilleryCharleston1863.jpg|Confederate artillery at Charleston Harbor, 1863\nFile: History of the Doles-Cook brigade of northern Virginia, C.S.

General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|major general]], and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]]), but all wore the same insignia regardless of grade. This was a decision made early in the conflict. The Confederate Congress initially made the rank of brigadier general the highest rank. As the war progressed, the other general-officer ranks were quickly added, but no insignia for them was created. (Robert E. Lee was a notable exception to this. He chose to wear the rank insignia of a colonel.) Only seven men achieved the rank of (full) general;<ref name=\"confederate\"/> the highest-ranking (earliest date of rank) was [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]], Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army.\n\nOfficers' uniforms bore a braided design on the sleeves and [[kepi]], the number of adjacent strips (and therefore the width of the lines of the design) denoting rank. The color of the piping and kepi denoted the military branch. The braid was sometimes left off by officers since it made them conspicuous targets. The kepi was rarely used, the common slouch hat being preferred for its practicality in the Southern climate.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=11| '''Enlisted rank structure'''\n|-\n![[Sergeant Major]]\n![[Quartermaster Sergeant]]\n![[Ordnance Sergeant]]\n![[First Sergeant]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant Major-Infantry.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Ordnance Sergeant-Artillery.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America First Sergeant.jpg|80px]]\n|-\n![[Sergeant]]\n![[Corporal]]\n![[Musician (rank)|Musician]]\n![[Private (rank)|Private]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Corporal-Cavalry.jpg|80px]]\n!no insignia\n!no insignia\n|}\n\nBranch colors were used for the color of chevrons\u2014blue for infantry, yellow for cavalry, and red for artillery. This could differ with some units, however, depending on available resources or the unit commander's desire. Cavalry regiments from Texas, for example, often used red insignia and at least one Texas infantry regiment used black.\n\nThe CSA differed from many contemporaneous armies in that all officers under the rank of [[brigadier general (CSA)|brigadier general]] were elected by the soldiers under their command. The Confederate Congress authorized the awarding of medals for courage and good conduct on October 13, 1862, but wartime difficulties prevented the procurement of the needed medals. To avoid postponing recognition for their valor, those nominated for the awards had their names placed on a [[Confederate Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]], which would be read at the first dress parade after its receipt and be published in at least one newspaper in each state.\n\n===Armies and prominent leaders===\nThe C.S. Army was composed of independent armies and military departments that were constituted, renamed, and disbanded as needs arose, particularly in reaction to offensives launched by the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]]. These major units were generally named after states or geographic regions (in comparison to the U.S. Army's custom of naming armies after rivers). Armies were usually commanded by [[Full General (CSA)#Major general|full generals]] (there were seven in the C.S. Army) or [[Lt. General (CSA)|lieutenant generals]].

The central government was short of money so each state government had to supply its regiments.  The lack of central authority and the ineffective [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|railroads]], combined with the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Confederate army's demise. The Confederacy early on lost control of most of its major river and ocean ports to capture or blockade. The road system was poor, and it relied more and more on a heavily overburdened railroad system. U.S. forces destroyed track, engines, cars, bridges and telegraph lines as often as possible, knowing that new equipment was unavailable to the Confederacy.<ref>George Edgar Turner, ''Victory rode the rails: the strategic place of the railroads in the Civil War'' (1972)</ref> Occasional raids into the North were designed to bring back money and supplies. In 1864, the Confederates burned down [[Chambersburg]], a Pennsylvania city they had raided twice in the years before, due to its failure to pay an extortion demand.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2163218|title = Chambersburg: Anatomy of a Confederate Reprisal|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 96|issue = 2|pages = 432\u2013455|last1 = Smith|first1 = Everard H.|year = 1991|doi = 10.2307/2163218}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of severe supply problems, as well as the lack of textile factories in the Confederacy and the successful U.S. naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]] (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure [[U.S. Army]] uniform parts from captured supplies and dead U.S. soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.<ref>Steven G. Collins, \"System in the South: John W. Mallet, Josiah Gorgas, and uniform production at the confederate ordnance department.\" ''Technology and culture'' (1999) 40#3 pp: 517\u2013544 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v040/40.3collins.html in Project MUSE].</ref>\n\nIndividual states were expected to supply their soldiers, which led to a lack of uniformity. Some states (such as North Carolina) were able to better supply their soldiers, while other states (such as Texas) were unable for various reasons to adequately supply their troops as the war continued.\n\nFurthermore, each state often had its uniform regulations and insignia, which meant that the \"standard\" Confederate uniform often featured a variety of differences based on the state the soldier came from. For example, uniforms for North Carolina regiments often featured a colored strip of cloth on their shoulders to designate what part of the service the soldier was in. Confederate soldiers also frequently suffered from inadequate supplies of shoes, tents, and other gear, and would be forced to innovate and make do with whatever they could scrounge from the local countryside. While Confederate officers were generally better-supplied and were normally able to wear a regulation officer's uniform, they often chose to share other hardships \u2013 such as the lack of adequate food \u2013 with their troops.\n\n[[File: Confederates marching through Frederick, MD in 1862.jpg|thumb|250px|Confederate troops marching south on N Market Street, [[Frederick, Maryland]], during the Civil War]]\n\nConfederate soldiers were also faced with inadequate food rations, especially as the war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia was at the end of a long, tenuous supply line. United States victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vandiver | first1 = Frank E. | year = 1944 | title = Texas and the Confederate Army's Meat Problem | journal = Southwestern Historical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 225\u2013233 | jstor=30236034}}</ref>\n\nBy 1863 Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] often spent as much time and effort searching for food for their men as they did in planning strategy and tactics. Individual commanders often had to \"[[Foraging|beg, borrow or steal]]\" food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured U.S. depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee's campaign against [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and southern [[Pennsylvania]] (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, especially food.<ref>Larry J. Daniel, ''Soldiering in the Army of Tennessee: A Portrait of Life in a Confederate Army'' (2003) ch 4 on inadequate rations</ref>\n\n[[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]'s [[total warfare]] reduced the ability of the South to produce food and ship it to the armies or its cities. Coupled with the [[Union blockade|U.S. blockade of all ports]] the devastation of plantations, farms and railroads meant the Confederacy increasingly lost the capacity to feed its soldiers and civilians.\n\n==Native Americans and the Confederate army==\n{{main|Native Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\nNative Americans served in both the United States and Confederate military during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> They fought knowing they might jeopardize their freedom, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War.<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"ac\"/> During the Civil War 28,693 Native Americans served in the U.S. and Confederate armies, participating in battles such as [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], [[Second Manassas]], [[Antietam]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse|Spotsylvania]], [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], and in Federal assaults on [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> Many Native American tribes, such as the Creek, the Cherokee, and the Choctaw, were slaveholders themselves, and thus, found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy.<ref name=\"Native_American_Slave_Ownership\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, [[Albert Pike]] was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the [[Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws]] conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, [[Confederate States of America]] citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Seminole]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. The [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] wanted to recruit Indians east of the Mississippi River in 1862, so they opened up a recruiting camp in [[Mobile, Alabama]] \"at the foot of Stone Street\".<ref name=\"j_matte1\"/> The ''Mobile Advertiser and Register'' would advertise for a chance at military service.\n\n{{quote|text=A Chance for Active Service.

Escott:\n\n{{quote|[F]or a great many of the most powerful southerners the idea of arming and freeing the slaves was repugnant because the protection of slavery had been and still remained the central core of Confederate purpose ...

Historians provide estimates of the actual number of individual Confederate soldiers between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men.<ref>Long, E. B. ''The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac, 1861\u20131865''.

Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served in each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the armies at any given date. Confederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on the number of Confederate soldiers. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. In contrast, about 25,000 Union soldiers died as a result of accidents, drowning, murder, killed after capture, suicide, execution for various crimes, execution by the Confederates (64), sunstroke, other and not stated. Confederate casualties for all these reasons are unavailable. Since some Confederate soldiers would have died for these reasons, more total deaths and total casualties for the Confederacy must have occurred. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026; another is 226,000. At the end of the war 174,223 men of the Confederate forces surrendered to the [[Union Army]].<ref name=\"www1\"/><ref>Long, 1971, p. 711</ref>\n\nCompared to the Union Army at the time, the Confederate army was not very ethnically diverse. Ninety-one percent of Confederate soldiers were native-born white men and only 9% were foreign-born white men, Irishmen being the largest group with others including Germans, French, Mexicans, and British.  A small number of Asian men were forcibly inducted into the Confederate army against their will when they arrived in Louisiana from overseas.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Burke|last=Davis|title=Civil War: Strange and Fascinating Facts|publisher=Random House|date=1960}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Inglish |first=Patty |title=Chinese Soldiers Who Fought in the American Civil War for the Union and the Confederacy |date=July 8, 2015 |work=HubPages |quote=Interestingly, some Chinese were 'Shanghaied' into the Confederate Army in New Orleans when they disembarked ships coming into port.

Davis was a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]], and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He had also been a [[United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]] and [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] under President [[Franklin Pierce]]. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the Confederate government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where South Carolina state militia besieged [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston harbor, held by a small [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] garrison. By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army.\n\nAn accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men. This does not include an unknown number of [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons.<ref>Records of the number of individuals who served in the [[United States Army]] are more extensive and reliable, but still are not entirely accurate. Estimates of the number of individual Union soldiers range between 1,550,000 and 2,400,000, with a number between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 most likely. Union Army records show slightly more than 2,677,000 enlistments but this number apparently includes many re-enlistments. These numbers do not include sailors who served in [[United States Navy]] or [[United States Marine Corps]]. These figures represent the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, not the size of the army at any given date.</ref> Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the army at any given date. These numbers do not include men who served in [[Confederate States Navy]].\n\nAlthough most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription, primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer. In the absence of exact records, estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts.<ref>Albert Burton Moore, ''Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy'' (1924).</ref>\n\nConfederate casualty figures also are incomplete and unreliable.

At home their families were in worsening condition and faced starvation and the depredations of roving bands of marauders. Many soldiers went home temporarily (\"[[Absent Without Official Leave]]\") and quietly returned when their family problems had been resolved. By September 1864, however, President Davis publicly admitted that two-thirds of the soldiers were absent, \"most of them without leave.\"  The problem escalated rapidly after that, and fewer and fewer men returned.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Williams|title=Rich Man's War: Class, Caste, and Confederate Defeat in the Lower Chattahoochee Valley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-U2z9lk833EC&pg=PA4|year=2011|publisher=University of Georgia Press|page=4|isbn=9780820340791}}</ref> Soldiers who were fighting in defense of their homes realized that they had to desert to fulfill that duty. Historian Mark Weitz argues that the official count of 103,400 deserters is too low. He concludes that most of the desertions came because the soldier felt he owed a higher duty to his own family than to the Confederacy.<ref>Mark A. Weitz, ''A higher duty: desertion among Georgia troops during the Civil War'' (U of Nebraska Press, 2005).</ref>\n\nConfederate policies regarding desertion generally were severe.  For example, on August 19, 1862, General Stonewall Jackson approved the court-martial sentence of execution for three soldiers for desertion, rejecting pleas for clemency from the soldier's regimental commander. Jackson's goal was to maintain discipline in a volunteer army whose homes were under threat of enemy occupation.<ref>K. M.

Lee, [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], [[James Longstreet]]) and even President Jefferson Davis, were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers who had been opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession, but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They felt that they had no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated to hear of such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it.\n\n===Personnel organization===\nAs in the [[Union Army|U.S. Army]], the Confederate Army's soldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\n\nAlthough fewer soldiers might comprise a squad or platoon, the smallest [[Infantry in the American Civil War|infantry maneuver unit]] in the Army was a company of 100 soldiers. Ten companies were organized into an infantry regiment, which theoretically had 1,000 men. In reality, as disease, desertions and casualties took their toll, and the common practice of sending replacements to form new regiments took hold, most regiments were greatly reduced in strength. By the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300\u2013400 men, with Confederate units slightly smaller on average than their U.S. counterparts. For example, at the pivotal [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], the average U.S. Army infantry regiment's strength was 433 men, versus 409 for Confederate infantry regiments.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historicaltimesi00faus|title=Historical times illustrated encyclopedia of the Civil War|date=1986|publisher=Harper & Row|others=Faust, Patricia L., Delaney, Norman C., Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana (Mississippi State University.

To the extent the word \"[[battalion]]\" was used to describe a military unit, it referred to a multi-company task force of a regiment or a near-regimental size unit.

Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually formed a [[Division (military)|division]]. Two to four divisions usually formed a [[corps]]. Two to four corps usually formed an army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently as if it were a small army. The Confederate States Army consisted of several field armies, named after their primary area of operation. The largest Confederate field army was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], whose surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Courthouse]] in 1865 marked the end of major combat operations in the US Civil War.\n\n[[Company (military unit)|Companies]] were commanded by captains and had two or more lieutenants. Regiments were commanded by colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a lower grade officer. Barring the same type of circumstances which might leave a lower grade officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Corporal Artillery CS Army.jpg|Corporal of the Artillery division of the Confederate Army\nFile:AdamJSlemmerinConfederateBatteryAtWarringtonAcrossFromFortPickens1861.jpg|Confederate mortar crew at Warrington, Florida in 1861, across from Fort Pickens\nFile:ArtilleryCharleston1863.jpg|Confederate artillery at Charleston Harbor, 1863\nFile: History of the Doles-Cook brigade of northern Virginia, C.S.

General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|major general]], and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|brigadier general]]), but all wore the same insignia regardless of grade. This was a decision made early in the conflict. The Confederate Congress initially made the rank of brigadier general the highest rank. As the war progressed, the other general-officer ranks were quickly added, but no insignia for them was created. (Robert E. Lee was a notable exception to this. He chose to wear the rank insignia of a colonel.) Only seven men achieved the rank of (full) general;<ref name=\"confederate\"/> the highest-ranking (earliest date of rank) was [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]], Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army.\n\nOfficers' uniforms bore a braided design on the sleeves and [[kepi]], the number of adjacent strips (and therefore the width of the lines of the design) denoting rank. The color of the piping and kepi denoted the military branch. The braid was sometimes left off by officers since it made them conspicuous targets. The kepi was rarely used, the common slouch hat being preferred for its practicality in the Southern climate.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=11| '''Enlisted rank structure'''\n|-\n![[Sergeant Major]]\n![[Quartermaster Sergeant]]\n![[Ordnance Sergeant]]\n![[First Sergeant]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant Major-Infantry.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Ordnance Sergeant-Artillery.jpg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America First Sergeant.jpg|80px]]\n|-\n![[Sergeant]]\n![[Corporal]]\n![[Musician (rank)|Musician]]\n![[Private (rank)|Private]]\n|-\n![[File:Confederate States of America Sergeant-Artillery.svg|80px]]\n![[File:Confederate States of America Corporal-Cavalry.jpg|80px]]\n!no insignia\n!no insignia\n|}\n\nBranch colors were used for the color of chevrons\u2014blue for infantry, yellow for cavalry, and red for artillery. This could differ with some units, however, depending on available resources or the unit commander's desire. Cavalry regiments from Texas, for example, often used red insignia and at least one Texas infantry regiment used black.\n\nThe CSA differed from many contemporaneous armies in that all officers under the rank of [[brigadier general (CSA)|brigadier general]] were elected by the soldiers under their command. The Confederate Congress authorized the awarding of medals for courage and good conduct on October 13, 1862, but wartime difficulties prevented the procurement of the needed medals. To avoid postponing recognition for their valor, those nominated for the awards had their names placed on a [[Confederate Roll of Honor|Roll of Honor]], which would be read at the first dress parade after its receipt and be published in at least one newspaper in each state.\n\n===Armies and prominent leaders===\nThe C.S.

F. Brandon<ref name=\"history-sites\"/>]]\n{{main|Confederate States of America#Transportation systems}}\n\nThe supply situation for most Confederate armies was dismal, even when they were victorious on the battlefield.  The central government was short of money so each state government had to supply its regiments.  The lack of central authority and the ineffective [[Confederate railroads in the American Civil War|railroads]], combined with the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Confederate army's demise. The Confederacy early on lost control of most of its major river and ocean ports to capture or blockade. The road system was poor, and it relied more and more on a heavily overburdened railroad system. U.S. forces destroyed track, engines, cars, bridges and telegraph lines as often as possible, knowing that new equipment was unavailable to the Confederacy.<ref>George Edgar Turner, ''Victory rode the rails: the strategic place of the railroads in the Civil War'' (1972)</ref> Occasional raids into the North were designed to bring back money and supplies. In 1864, the Confederates burned down [[Chambersburg]], a Pennsylvania city they had raided twice in the years before, due to its failure to pay an extortion demand.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2163218|title = Chambersburg: Anatomy of a Confederate Reprisal|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 96|issue = 2|pages = 432\u2013455|last1 = Smith|first1 = Everard H.|year = 1991|doi = 10.2307/2163218}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of severe supply problems, as well as the lack of textile factories in the Confederacy and the successful U.S. naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as [[Juglans cinerea|butternut]] (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure [[U.S. Army]] uniform parts from captured supplies and dead U.S. soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.<ref>Steven G. Collins, \"System in the South: John W. Mallet, Josiah Gorgas, and uniform production at the confederate ordnance department.\" ''Technology and culture'' (1999) 40#3 pp: 517\u2013544 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v040/40.3collins.html in Project MUSE].</ref>\n\nIndividual states were expected to supply their soldiers, which led to a lack of uniformity. Some states (such as North Carolina) were able to better supply their soldiers, while other states (such as Texas) were unable for various reasons to adequately supply their troops as the war continued.\n\nFurthermore, each state often had its uniform regulations and insignia, which meant that the \"standard\" Confederate uniform often featured a variety of differences based on the state the soldier came from. For example, uniforms for North Carolina regiments often featured a colored strip of cloth on their shoulders to designate what part of the service the soldier was in. Confederate soldiers also frequently suffered from inadequate supplies of shoes, tents, and other gear, and would be forced to innovate and make do with whatever they could scrounge from the local countryside. While Confederate officers were generally better-supplied and were normally able to wear a regulation officer's uniform, they often chose to share other hardships \u2013 such as the lack of adequate food \u2013 with their troops.\n\n[[File: Confederates marching through Frederick, MD in 1862.jpg|thumb|250px|Confederate troops marching south on N Market Street, [[Frederick, Maryland]], during the Civil War]]\n\nConfederate soldiers were also faced with inadequate food rations, especially as the war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia was at the end of a long, tenuous supply line. United States victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vandiver | first1 = Frank E. | year = 1944 | title = Texas and the Confederate Army's Meat Problem | journal = Southwestern Historical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 225\u2013233 | jstor=30236034}}</ref>\n\nBy 1863 Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee]] often spent as much time and effort searching for food for their men as they did in planning strategy and tactics. Individual commanders often had to \"[[Foraging|beg, borrow or steal]]\" food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured U.S. depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee's campaign against [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and southern [[Pennsylvania]] (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, especially food.<ref>Larry J. Daniel, ''Soldiering in the Army of Tennessee: A Portrait of Life in a Confederate Army'' (2003) ch 4 on inadequate rations</ref>\n\n[[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]'s [[total warfare]] reduced the ability of the South to produce food and ship it to the armies or its cities. Coupled with the [[Union blockade|U.S. blockade of all ports]] the devastation of plantations, farms and railroads meant the Confederacy increasingly lost the capacity to feed its soldiers and civilians.\n\n==Native Americans and the Confederate army==\n{{main|Native Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\nNative Americans served in both the United States and Confederate military during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> They fought knowing they might jeopardize their freedom, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War.<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"ac\"/> During the Civil War 28,693 Native Americans served in the U.S. and Confederate armies, participating in battles such as [[Battle of Pea Ridge|Pea Ridge]], [[Second Manassas]], [[Antietam]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse|Spotsylvania]], [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]], and in Federal assaults on [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].<ref name=\"aa\"/><ref name=\"Native_American_Participation_Numbers\"/> Many Native American tribes, such as the Creek, the Cherokee, and the Choctaw, were slaveholders themselves, and thus, found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy.<ref name=\"Native_American_Slave_Ownership\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of the war, [[Albert Pike]] was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the [[Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws]] conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, [[Confederate States of America]] citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Seminole]], [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]], and [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. The [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] wanted to recruit Indians east of the Mississippi River in 1862, so they opened up a recruiting camp in [[Mobile, Alabama]] \"at the foot of Stone Street\".<ref name=\"j_matte1\"/> The ''Mobile Advertiser and Register'' would advertise for a chance at military service.\n\n{{quote|text=A Chance for Active Service.

Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 7\u20138, 1862, Drew's Mounted Rifles defected to the United States forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, U.S. troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the United States Army.<ref name=\"aa\"/>\n\n[[William Holland Thomas]], the only white chief of the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], recruited hundreds of Cherokees for the Confederate army, particularly for [[Thomas' Legion]].

The Choctaws, who were expecting support from the Confederates, got little. Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General [[Albert Pike]] authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Seminoles, Creeks, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them. A disgusted officer later acknowledged that \"with the exception of a partial supply for the Choctaw regiment, no tents, clothing, or camp, and garrison equipage was furnished to any of them.\"<ref name=\"webb_garrison\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==African Americans and the Confederate Army==\n[[File: Negroes Being Driven South By the Rebel Officers (November 1862), by Harper's Weekly.jpg|thumb|An 1862 illustration showing Confederates escorting kidnapped African American civilians south into slavery.

Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served in each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the armies at any given date. Confederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on the number of Confederate soldiers. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. In contrast, about 25,000 Union soldiers died as a result of accidents, drowning, murder, killed after capture, suicide, execution for various crimes, execution by the Confederates (64), sunstroke, other and not stated. Confederate casualties for all these reasons are unavailable. Since some Confederate soldiers would have died for these reasons, more total deaths and total casualties for the Confederacy must have occurred. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026; another is 226,000.

{"title_page": "Bosnia and Herzegovina Chess Championship", "text_new": "The '''Bosnia and Herzegovina Chess Championship''' is the national [[chess]] championship of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was first organised in 2005 by the BIH Chess Union; more than ten years after its independence from [[Yugoslavia]]. In the first edition there were six players from Bosnia and Herzegovina and six players from [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The first edition was marked by the absence of leading players such as [[Borki Predojevi\u0107]], [[Bojan Kurajica]] and Emir Dizdarevi\u0107. The second edition was played with 10 players from Bosnia and Herzegovina and two players from Serbia and Montenegro. The field in the third edition consisted entirely of Bosnia and Herzegovina chess players. With Borki Predojevi\u0107 and [[Predrag Nikoli\u0107]] participating, it was the strongest edition so far.\n\n==Winners==\n:{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! # !! Year !! City !!

This randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits found in the crop (like high yield or good nutrition) can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used.\n\nMaize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on [[Selection methods in plant breeding based on mode of reproduction|mass selection]]. Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection (C. G. Hopkins c. 1896), hybrids made from selected [[inbred]] lines (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using four inbred lines ([[Donald F. Jones|D. F. Jones]] c. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958). By the 1930s, companies such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Pioneer]] devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long-term development. Internationally important seed banks such as the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT) and the US bank at the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] maintain [[germplasm]] important for future crop development.\n\nSince the 1940s the best strains of maize have been first-generation hybrids made from inbred strains that have been optimized for specific traits, such as yield, nutrition, drought, pest and disease tolerance. Both conventional cross-breeding and genetic modification have succeeded in increasing output and reducing the need for cropland, pesticides, water and fertilizer.<ref name=nyt14 /> There is conflicting evidence to support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades. This suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle, lodging resistance, tolerance of high plant density, disease/pest tolerance, and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2135/cropsci1999.3961622x | author = Duvick, D.

''parviglumis'', native to the [[Balsas River]] valley in south-eastern Mexico, with up to 12% of its [[genetic material]] obtained from ''Zea mays'' ssp. ''mexicana'' through [[introgression]]. This theory was further confirmed by the 2002 study of Matsuoka et al.<ref name=\"Mat\" />\n# It has been derived from hybridization between a small domesticated maize (a slightly changed form of a wild maize) and a teosinte of section ''Luxuriantes'', either ''Z. luxurians'' or ''[[Zea diploperennis|Z. diploperennis]]''.\n# It has undergone two or more domestications either of a wild maize or of a teosinte. (The term \"teosinte\" describes all [[species]] and subspecies in the genus ''Zea'', excluding ''Zea mays'' ssp. ''mays''.)\n# It has evolved from a hybridization of ''Z. diploperennis'' by ''[[Tripsacum dactyloides]]''.\nIn the late 1930s, Paul Mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of ''[[Tripsacum]]'', a related genus. This theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern [[genetic testing]], which refutes Mangelsdorf's model and the fourth listed above.<ref name=\"wilkes\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nThe teosinte origin theory was proposed by the Russian botanist [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov]] in 1931 and the later American [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[George Beadle]] in 1932.<ref name=\"wilkes\" />{{rp|10}} It is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants' genomes. Teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring. A number of questions remain concerning the species, among them:\n# how the immense diversity of the species of sect. ''Zea'' originated,\n# how the tiny archaeological specimens of 3500\u20132700 BC could have been selected from a teosinte, and\n# how domestication could have proceeded without leaving remains of teosinte or maize with teosintoid traits earlier than the earliest known until recently, dating from ca. 1100 BC.\n\nThe [[domestication]] of maize is of particular interest to researchers\u2014[[archaeologist]]s, [[genetics|geneticists]], [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanists]], geographers, etc. The process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. Research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of [[Oaxaca]] and [[Jalisco]], because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there.\n\n=== Connection with 'parviglumis' subspecies ===\n[[File:Maize-teosinte.jpg|thumb|[[teosinte]] (top), maize-teosinte hybrid (middle), maize (bottom)]]\n\nGenetic studies, published in 2004 by [[John Doebley]], identified ''Zea mays'' ssp.

Archaeobotanical studies, published in 2009, point to the middle part of the Balsas River valley as the likely location of early domestication; this river is not very long, so these locations are not very distant.

Its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation \u2013 from the planting to the food preparation. Maize formed the Mesoamerican people's identity.\n\nIt is unknown what precipitated its domestication, because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small, and hard to obtain, to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell.\n\nIn 1939, George Beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily \"popped\" for human consumption, like modern popcorn.<ref>NORMAN H.

Its [[root]] system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses [[C4 carbon fixation]], maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use [[C3 carbon fixation]] such as [[alfalfa]] and [[soybeans]]. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize was \"knee-high by the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]\", although modern [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for [[silage]] is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the \"milk stage\", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field maize is left in the field until very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact, sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring. The importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of Africa, where periodic [[drought]] regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent [[famine]]. Although it is grown mainly in wet, hot climates, it has been said to thrive in cold, hot, dry or wet conditions, meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop.<ref>Fernandez-Armesto, Felipe (2011). \"The World: A History\", p. 470.

Maize provided support for [[bean]]s, and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing [[rhizobia]] bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other [[legume]]s; and [[Squash (fruit)|squashes]] provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil.<ref name=Mann_2011>{{cite book |title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus |edition=2nd |authorlink=Charles C.

In more arid lands, this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of {{convert|10|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep furrows to collect water. Modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young, although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some Native American reservations. When maize is planted in rows, it also allows for planting of other crops between these rows to make more efficient use of land space.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Maize|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0002.667/--maize?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=Agriculture|journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot & d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project|accessdate=April 1, 2015|date=2011-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn most regions today, maize grown in residential [[garden]]s is still often planted manually with a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]], whereas maize grown commercially is no longer planted manually but rather is planted with a [[planter (farm implement)|planter]]. In North America, fields are often planted in a two-[[crop rotation]] with a [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] crop, often [[alfalfa]] in cooler climates and [[soybean]]s in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, [[winter wheat]], is added to the rotation.\n\nMany of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Often the varieties have been [[genetically modified]] to tolerate [[glyphosate]] or to provide protection against natural pests. Glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance. This genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature.\n\nIn the midwestern United States, low-till or [[no-till farming]] techniques are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest. The fields are planted and [[anhydrous ammonia|fertilized]]. [[Weed]]s are controlled through the use of [[herbicide]]s, and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.\nThe technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming. Weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients, making them undesirable.\n\n=== Harvesting ===\n[[File:YellowCorn.jpg|thumb|right|Mature maize ears]]\n[[File:Iowa harvest 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Harvesting maize, [[Jones County, Iowa]]]]\n[[File:MyanmarCorn3.jpg|thumb|right|Hand-picking harvest of maize in Myanmar.]]\nBefore the 20th century, all maize harvesting was by [[manual labour]], by [[grazing]], or by some combination of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the [[corn stover|stover]] was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and [[stook|shocked]], people and [[livestock]] did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, [[appropriate technology|as appropriate to each farm's needs]], although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest [[unit cost]]s when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher [[fixed cost]] cannot be [[amortization|amortized]] over as many units.\n\nBefore [[World War II]], most maize in North America was harvested by hand. This involved a large numbers of workers and associated social events (husking or shucking [[communal work|bees]]). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the [[corn stover|stover]]) and corn binders, which are [[reaper-binder]]s designed specifically for maize (for example, {{YouTube|zA3zbJNvWuo}}). The latter produce [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] that can be [[stook|shocked]]. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in [[corn crib]]s, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a [[combine harvester|combine]] and store it in [[silo#Bins|bins]]. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become [[organic matter]] for the [[soil]]. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.\n\nWhen maize is a [[silage]] crop, the entire plant is usually chopped at once with a [[forage harvester]] (chopper) and ensiled in silos or polymer wrappers. Ensiling of sheaves cut by a corn binder was formerly common in some regions but has become uncommon.\n\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n\nFor storing grain in bins, the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling. If the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high, [[grain drying|grain dryers]] are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain. This can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases ([[propane]] or [[natural gas]]) and electricity to power the blowers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Devender|first=Karl|title=Grain Drying Concepts and Options|publisher=University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture|date=July 2011|url=http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-1072.pdf|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\nMaize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain.<ref name=global>{{cite web|title=International Grains Council Market Report 28 November 2013|url=http://www.igc.int/downloads/gmrsummary/gmrsumme.pdf|author=International Grains Council (international organization)|year=2013|author-link=International Grains Council (international organization)}}</ref> In 2018, total world production was 1.15 billion [[tonne]]s, led by the United States with 34.2% of the total (table).

Virtually every dish in Mexican cuisine uses maize. In the form of grain or cornmeal, maize is the main ingredient of [[Corn tortilla|tortillas]], [[tamale]]s, [[pozole]], [[atole]] and all the dishes based on them, like [[taco]]s, [[quesadilla]]s, [[chilaquiles]], [[enchilada]]s, [[tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] and many more. In Mexico even a fungus of maize, known as [[huitlacoche]] is considered a delicacy.\n\nIntroduced into Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th century, maize has become Africa's most important staple food crop.<ref>\"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]\". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).</ref> Maize meal is made into a thick [[porridge]] in many cultures: from the [[polenta]] of Italy, the ''angu'' of Brazil, the ''[[m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103]]'' of Romania, to [[Mush (cornmeal)|cornmeal mush]] in the US (and [[hominy]] [[grits]] in the South) or the food called [[mealie pap]] in South Africa and ''[[sadza]]'', ''[[nshima]]'' and ''[[ugali]]'' in other parts of Africa. Maize meal is also used as a replacement for [[wheat]] flour, to make [[cornbread]] and other baked products. [[Masa]] (cornmeal treated with [[limewater]]) is the main ingredient for [[tortilla]]s, [[atole]] and many other dishes of Central American food.\n\n[[Popcorn]] consists of kernels of certain varieties that explode when heated, forming fluffy pieces that are eaten as a snack. Roasted dried maize ears with semihardened kernels, coated with a seasoning mixture of fried chopped spring onions with salt added to the oil, is a popular [[snack food]] in Vietnam. ''Cancha'', which are roasted maize chulpe kernels, are a very popular snack food in Peru, and also appears in traditional Peruvian ''[[ceviche]]''. An unleavened bread called ''[[makki di roti]]'' is a popular bread eaten in the [[Punjab region]] of India and Pakistan.\n\n''[[Chicha]]'' and ''chicha morada'' (purple chicha) are drinks typically made from particular types of maize. The first one is fermented and alcoholic, the second is a soft drink commonly drunk in Peru.\n\n[[Corn flakes]] are a common [[breakfast cereal]] in North America and the United Kingdom, and found in many other countries all over the world.\n\nMaize can also be prepared as [[hominy]], in which the kernels are soaked with [[lye]] in a process called [[nixtamalization]]; or [[grits]], which are coarsely ground hominy. These are commonly eaten in the [[Southeastern United States]], foods handed down from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who called the dish [[sagamite]].\n\nThe Brazilian dessert [[canjica (dish)|''canjica'']] is made by boiling maize kernels in sweetened milk.\nMaize can also be harvested and consumed in the unripe state, when the kernels are fully grown but still soft. Unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable; this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob. [[Sweet corn]], a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch, is usually consumed in the unripe state. Such [[corn on the cob]] is a common dish in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Cyprus, some parts of South America, and the Balkans, but virtually unheard of in some European countries. Corn on the cob was hawked on the streets of early 19th-century New York City by poor, barefoot \"[[Hot Corn]] Girls\", who were thus the precursors of [[hot dog cart]]s, [[churro]] wagons, and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today.<ref>Solon Robinson. Hot Corn: Life Scenes in New York Illustrated (Series appearing in 1853 in the NY Tribune, later as a book)</ref> The cooked, unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a [[vegetable]] in side dishes, [[salad]]s, [[garnish (food)|garnishes]], etc. Alternatively, the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes, such as maize [[pur\u00e9e]], [[tamale]]s, ''[[pamonha]]s'', ''[[curau]]'', [[cake]]s, [[ice cream]]s, etc.[[File:Maizes on fire.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|Maize being thoroughly [[roasting|roasted]] in portable [[brazer]] in India]]\n\nMaize is a major source of [[starch]]. [[Cornstarch]] (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of [[cooking oil]] ([[corn oil]]) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly [[high fructose corn syrup]], a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce [[grain alcohol]]. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of [[Bourbon whiskey]]. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for [[beer]].\n\nWithin the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed [[livestock]], as forage, [[silage]] (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as [[dog food]].\n\nBoiled corn (Russian: \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0430, ''kukur\u00faza'') is one of the most popular [[street food]]s in Russia.

It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried [[corn kernel|kernels]] are used as feed. They are often kept on the [[corncob|cob]] for storage in a [[corn crib]], or they may be shelled off for storage in a [[grain bin]]. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the [[corn stover]]) can be used later as fodder, [[bedding (animals)|bedding]] (litter), or [[soil conditioner|soil amendment]]. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually [[forage harvester|chopped all at once]] and [[silage|ensilaged]], as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage is one of the most valuable forages for ruminants.<ref>Heuz\u00e9 V., Tran G., Edouard N., Lebas F., 2017. Maize silage.

With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in [[silo]]es but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.<ref>Heuz\u00e9 V., Tran G., Edouard N., Lebas F., 2017. Maize green forage.

High fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol, which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize. This led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers. Because of the relationship between fuel and maize, prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nThe price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/2008/0128/p03s03-usec.html|title=Christian Science Monitor|journal=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mark Clayton|date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iowarfa.org/food_facts.php |title=Iowa Renewable Fuels Association |publisher= |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011043043/http://www.iowarfa.org/food_facts.php |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Haase anaerobic digester.JPG|left|thumb|Farm-based maize silage digester located near [[Neum\u00fcnster]] in Germany, 2007.

This randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits found in the crop (like high yield or good nutrition) can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used.\n\nMaize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on [[Selection methods in plant breeding based on mode of reproduction|mass selection]]. Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection (C. G. Hopkins c. 1896), hybrids made from selected [[inbred]] lines (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using four inbred lines ([[Donald F. Jones|D. F. Jones]] c. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958). By the 1930s, companies such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Pioneer]] devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long-term development. Internationally important seed banks such as the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT) and the US bank at the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] maintain [[germplasm]] important for future crop development.\n\nSince the 1940s the best strains of maize have been first-generation hybrids made from inbred strains that have been optimized for specific traits, such as yield, nutrition, drought, pest and disease tolerance. Both conventional cross-breeding and genetic modification have succeeded in increasing output and reducing the need for cropland, pesticides, water and fertilizer.<ref name=nyt14 /> There is conflicting evidence to support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades. This suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle, lodging resistance, tolerance of high plant density, disease/pest tolerance, and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2135/cropsci1999.3961622x | author = Duvick, D.

''mays''.)\n# It has evolved from a hybridization of ''Z. diploperennis'' by ''[[Tripsacum dactyloides]]''.\nIn the late 1930s, Paul Mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of ''[[Tripsacum]]'', a related genus. This theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern [[genetic testing]], which refutes Mangelsdorf's model and the fourth listed above.<ref name=\"wilkes\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nThe teosinte origin theory was proposed by the Russian botanist [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov]] in 1931 and the later American [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[George Beadle]] in 1932.<ref name=\"wilkes\" />{{rp|10}} It is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants' genomes. Teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring. A number of questions remain concerning the species, among them:\n# how the immense diversity of the species of sect. ''Zea'' originated,\n# how the tiny archaeological specimens of 3500\u20132700 BC could have been selected from a teosinte, and\n# how domestication could have proceeded without leaving remains of teosinte or maize with teosintoid traits earlier than the earliest known until recently, dating from ca. 1100 BC.\n\nThe [[domestication]] of maize is of particular interest to researchers\u2014[[archaeologist]]s, [[genetics|geneticists]], [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanists]], geographers, etc. The process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago.

Its [[root]] system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses [[C4 carbon fixation]], maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use [[C3 carbon fixation]] such as [[alfalfa]] and [[soybeans]]. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize was \"knee-high by the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]\", although modern [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for [[silage]] is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the \"milk stage\", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field maize is left in the field until very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact, sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring. The importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of Africa, where periodic [[drought]] regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent [[famine]]. Although it is grown mainly in wet, hot climates, it has been said to thrive in cold, hot, dry or wet conditions, meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop.<ref>Fernandez-Armesto, Felipe (2011). \"The World: A History\", p. 470.

In North America, fields are often planted in a two-[[crop rotation]] with a [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] crop, often [[alfalfa]] in cooler climates and [[soybean]]s in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, [[winter wheat]], is added to the rotation.\n\nMany of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Often the varieties have been [[genetically modified]] to tolerate [[glyphosate]] or to provide protection against natural pests. Glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance. This genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature.\n\nIn the midwestern United States, low-till or [[no-till farming]] techniques are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest. The fields are planted and [[anhydrous ammonia|fertilized]]. [[Weed]]s are controlled through the use of [[herbicide]]s, and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.\nThe technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming. Weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients, making them undesirable.\n\n=== Harvesting ===\n[[File:YellowCorn.jpg|thumb|right|Mature maize ears]]\n[[File:Iowa harvest 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Harvesting maize, [[Jones County, Iowa]]]]\n[[File:MyanmarCorn3.jpg|thumb|right|Hand-picking harvest of maize in Myanmar.]]\nBefore the 20th century, all maize harvesting was by [[manual labour]], by [[grazing]], or by some combination of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the [[corn stover|stover]] was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and [[stook|shocked]], people and [[livestock]] did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, [[appropriate technology|as appropriate to each farm's needs]], although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest [[unit cost]]s when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher [[fixed cost]] cannot be [[amortization|amortized]] over as many units.\n\nBefore [[World War II]], most maize in North America was harvested by hand. This involved a large numbers of workers and associated social events (husking or shucking [[communal work|bees]]). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the [[corn stover|stover]]) and corn binders, which are [[reaper-binder]]s designed specifically for maize (for example, {{YouTube|zA3zbJNvWuo}}). The latter produce [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] that can be [[stook|shocked]]. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in [[corn crib]]s, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a [[combine harvester|combine]] and store it in [[silo#Bins|bins]]. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become [[organic matter]] for the [[soil]]. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.\n\nWhen maize is a [[silage]] crop, the entire plant is usually chopped at once with a [[forage harvester]] (chopper) and ensiled in silos or polymer wrappers. Ensiling of sheaves cut by a corn binder was formerly common in some regions but has become uncommon.\n\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n\nFor storing grain in bins, the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling. If the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high, [[grain drying|grain dryers]] are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain. This can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases ([[propane]] or [[natural gas]]) and electricity to power the blowers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Devender|first=Karl|title=Grain Drying Concepts and Options|publisher=University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture|date=July 2011|url=http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-1072.pdf|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\nMaize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain.<ref name=global>{{cite web|title=International Grains Council Market Report 28 November 2013|url=http://www.igc.int/downloads/gmrsummary/gmrsumme.pdf|author=International Grains Council (international organization)|year=2013|author-link=International Grains Council (international organization)}}</ref> In 2018, total world production was 1.15 billion [[tonne]]s, led by the United States with 34.2% of the total (table).

Virtually every dish in Mexican cuisine uses maize. In the form of grain or cornmeal, maize is the main ingredient of [[Corn tortilla|tortillas]], [[tamale]]s, [[pozole]], [[atole]] and all the dishes based on them, like [[taco]]s, [[quesadilla]]s, [[chilaquiles]], [[enchilada]]s, [[tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] and many more. In Mexico even a fungus of maize, known as [[huitlacoche]] is considered a delicacy.\n\nIntroduced into Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th century, maize has become Africa's most important staple food crop.<ref>\"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]\". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).</ref> Maize meal is made into a thick [[porridge]] in many cultures: from the [[polenta]] of Italy, the ''angu'' of Brazil, the ''[[m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103]]'' of Romania, to [[Mush (cornmeal)|cornmeal mush]] in the US (and [[hominy]] [[grits]] in the South) or the food called [[mealie pap]] in South Africa and ''[[sadza]]'', ''[[nshima]]'' and ''[[ugali]]'' in other parts of Africa. Maize meal is also used as a replacement for [[wheat]] flour, to make [[cornbread]] and other baked products. [[Masa]] (cornmeal treated with [[limewater]]) is the main ingredient for [[tortilla]]s, [[atole]] and many other dishes of Central American food.\n\n[[Popcorn]] consists of kernels of certain varieties that explode when heated, forming fluffy pieces that are eaten as a snack. Roasted dried maize ears with semihardened kernels, coated with a seasoning mixture of fried chopped spring onions with salt added to the oil, is a popular [[snack food]] in Vietnam. ''Cancha'', which are roasted maize chulpe kernels, are a very popular snack food in Peru, and also appears in traditional Peruvian ''[[ceviche]]''. An unleavened bread called ''[[makki di roti]]'' is a popular bread eaten in the [[Punjab region]] of India and Pakistan.\n\n''[[Chicha]]'' and ''chicha morada'' (purple chicha) are drinks typically made from particular types of maize. The first one is fermented and alcoholic, the second is a soft drink commonly drunk in Peru.\n\n[[Corn flakes]] are a common [[breakfast cereal]] in North America and the United Kingdom, and found in many other countries all over the world.\n\nMaize can also be prepared as [[hominy]], in which the kernels are soaked with [[lye]] in a process called [[nixtamalization]]; or [[grits]], which are coarsely ground hominy. These are commonly eaten in the [[Southeastern United States]], foods handed down from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who called the dish [[sagamite]].\n\nThe Brazilian dessert [[canjica (dish)|''canjica'']] is made by boiling maize kernels in sweetened milk.\nMaize can also be harvested and consumed in the unripe state, when the kernels are fully grown but still soft. Unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable; this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob. [[Sweet corn]], a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch, is usually consumed in the unripe state. Such [[corn on the cob]] is a common dish in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Cyprus, some parts of South America, and the Balkans, but virtually unheard of in some European countries. Corn on the cob was hawked on the streets of early 19th-century New York City by poor, barefoot \"[[Hot Corn]] Girls\", who were thus the precursors of [[hot dog cart]]s, [[churro]] wagons, and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today.<ref>Solon Robinson. Hot Corn: Life Scenes in New York Illustrated (Series appearing in 1853 in the NY Tribune, later as a book)</ref> The cooked, unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a [[vegetable]] in side dishes, [[salad]]s, [[garnish (food)|garnishes]], etc. Alternatively, the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes, such as maize [[pur\u00e9e]], [[tamale]]s, ''[[pamonha]]s'', ''[[curau]]'', [[cake]]s, [[ice cream]]s, etc.[[File:Maizes on fire.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|Maize being thoroughly [[roasting|roasted]] in portable [[brazer]] in India]]\n\nMaize is a major source of [[starch]]. [[Cornstarch]] (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of [[cooking oil]] ([[corn oil]]) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly [[high fructose corn syrup]], a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce [[grain alcohol]]. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of [[Bourbon whiskey]]. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for [[beer]].\n\nWithin the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed [[livestock]], as forage, [[silage]] (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as [[dog food]].\n\nBoiled corn (Russian: \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0430, ''kukur\u00faza'') is one of the most popular [[street food]]s in Russia.

They are often kept on the [[corncob|cob]] for storage in a [[corn crib]], or they may be shelled off for storage in a [[grain bin]]. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the [[corn stover]]) can be used later as fodder, [[bedding (animals)|bedding]] (litter), or [[soil conditioner|soil amendment]]. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually [[forage harvester|chopped all at once]] and [[silage|ensilaged]], as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage is one of the most valuable forages for ruminants.<ref>Heuz\u00e9 V., Tran G., Edouard N., Lebas F., 2017. Maize silage.

High fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol, which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize. This led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers. Because of the relationship between fuel and maize, prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nThe price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/2008/0128/p03s03-usec.html|title=Christian Science Monitor|journal=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mark Clayton|date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iowarfa.org/food_facts.php |title=Iowa Renewable Fuels Association |publisher= |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011043043/http://www.iowarfa.org/food_facts.php |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Haase anaerobic digester.JPG|left|thumb|Farm-based maize silage digester located near [[Neum\u00fcnster]] in Germany, 2007.

Its ecclesiastical jurisdiction includes the northern and central parts of the state of [[Mississippi]], an area of {{convert|97,458|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is the largest diocese, by area, in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]]. It was formerly known as the ''Diocese of Natchez'' (1837\u20131956) and the ''Diocese of Natchez-Jackson'' (1956\u201377). [[Jackson, Mississippi]] is the [[episcopal see]].\n\n==History==\nThe region which is now the Diocese of Jackson made its first contacts with the Catholic Church through French [[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries during the expeditions of [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]], [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]], and [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville|d'Iberville]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1787, three [[Spain|Spanish]] priests, Fathers McKenna, White, and Savage, arrived at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] from [[Salamanca]] and erected three missions in the vicinity. These missions, however, virtually disappeared after the Spanish turned over the area to the United States. Much valuable property was lost to the Church, and the efforts made to recover it were in vain.<ref name=Charles>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10709b.htm Charles, Brother. \"Natchez.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10.
