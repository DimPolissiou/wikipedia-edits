One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted. Near Tynes Ainsworth Road, a mobile home was tossed and completely destroyed; both occupants died.

Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted. Near Tynes Ainsworth Road, a mobile home was tossed and completely destroyed; both occupants died.
