He was educated in [[English literature]] at [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross College]], a Catholic college in [[Massachusetts]], and after graduation spent two years in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] doing law-related work.  Upon return to Boston, Pitt taught [[English literature]], [[journalism]], [[grammar]], and [[history]] at a small [[private school]]. In 2002, he joined the staff of the non-profit news organization [[Truthout]] as a contributing writer, and is now lead columnist and a senior editor. He lives and works in [[Keene, New Hampshire]] but remains a devoted [[Sports in Boston|Boston sports]] fan. Pitt is married and has a daughter.\n\n==Writing career==\nPitt became devoted to writing about politics during the [[impeachment]] [[trial (law)|trial]] of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

He was selected for the New Zealand tour of Australia in 1919 and became Kiwi number 121 in the process.\n\n==Early Life==\nArchie Waddell grew up in [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]]. When he was just 8 months old his father was killed in a boating accident. The Northumberland launch which was working at Napier Port was stranded in a severe gale at anchor on 11 May, 1887 and was unable to berth. The Union Company\u2019s steam launch, Boojum, was sent out to help but was capsized and thrown on to Petane Beach.

Indeed Waddell had joined the war effort and was part of a group of 200 New Zealanders who volunteered in London. He was listed as being from Waipu, though this is more likely a misspelling of Waiapu where there Waiapu Cathedral stands.

He was selected for the New Zealand tour of Australia in 1919 and became Kiwi number 121 in the process.\n\n==Early Life==\nArchie Waddell grew up in [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]]. When he was just 8 months old his father was killed in a boating accident. The Northumberland launch which was working at Napier Port was stranded in a severe gale at anchor on 11 May, 1887 and was unable to berth. The Union Company\u2019s steam launch, Boojum, was sent out to help but was capsized and thrown on to Petane Beach.

He took a losing program, that had never had a winning year, to six consecutive winning seasons, a region championship, and five runners-up berths. He was Coach of the Year on four occasions, and had a record of 74-24-4.  He was also director of soccer for the Upson Lee Soccer Association.\n\n'''U.S. Olympic Federation'''\n\nSisterson was hired as women's head soccer coach for the U.S. Deaf Soccer Association in 2003. The team previously had poor results in worldwide tournaments. The goal was to prepare and qualify a team for the 2005 Deaflympics in Melbourne, Australia. Sisterson recruited his new squad throughout the U.S., getting mainly NCAA D1 players. Holding training camps in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and New York, Sisterson delivered immediate results. The team was unbeaten in pre-Olympic games against NCAA university teams, and qualified for the Deaflympics as favorites. Sisterson's team remained undefeated throughout Olympic competition (7-0), beating Great Britain in the quarter final, Denmark in the semi-final, culminating in the defeat of Russia in the Gold Medal game, at the Olympic Stadium in Melbourne.<ref>http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/02/u-s-womens-deaflympic-team-wins-gold-medal-at-2005-deaflympics-in-australia/</ref> Sisterson signed a new contract to lead the team to the 2009 Deaflympics in Chinese Taipei, upon returning from Australia. He selected and trained the squad until 2009, but due to head coaching commitments at Santa Barbara City College, could not attend the Olympics. His assistant, and longtime friend, Ken McDonald, led the team, again unbeaten, to win the Gold Medal.\n\n'''W Texas A&M University'''\n\nSisterson became head assistant at W Texas A&M University in 2004.  He coached both the men's and women's programs, and was the recruiting coordinator. The women's team were NCAA Region Tournament finalists, losing to the eventual national champions. The women's team had a record of 13-6-1, and the men's team, who were also tournament finalists, had a record of 11-7-2. Sisterson resigned as head assistant, to accept a head coaching position in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n'''Santa Barbara City College'''\n\nSisterson was hired as head women's soccer coach in 2005. In 2008, he was also appointed as the head men's soccer coach, by Athletic Director, Mike Warren. Sisterson led the Vaquero women's team to Western State Conference (WSC) championships in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2018 and 2019. In 2017 both the men and women's teams were unbeaten in regular season. In 2014, the team was unbeaten in conference.<ref>http://westernstateconference.com/sports/wsoc/2014-15/releases/20141126moin5v/</ref> This was the first time this had been achieved in the program's history. Prior to Sisterson, the women's team had never won a conference title and was nationally unranked. Under Sisterson's guidance, the women's team has achieved numerous national rankings, as high as 2nd in 2017, 5th in 2008 and 2011 and 6th in 2016. He has also led the team to 13  out of 14 post-season tournament appearances, and has a record of 203-68-51 since 2005. The Vaquero women have been honored with five of the last six Western State Conference Player of the Year awards. His success with the Vaqueros men's team includes winning the Western State Conference championship on four occasions. The men's team were also Final Four participants in 2011 and the Women's team in 2016 and 2017 and in 2017 were State Runners Up.  Under Sisterson's tutelage, the team has produced four Western State Conference Player of the Year recipients. The Vaquero men's team are the all-time winningest in the Western State Conference, and Sisterson has won four WSC titles with a 160-70-48 record .

Sisterson has won 9  Western State Championships, as well as receiving coach of the year awards on 10 occasions. In 2011 both the men's and women's teams were Western State Conference Champions, the only time this has been achieved by one college in the history of the Western State Conference, and this was also repeated in 2017, Sisterson being head coach of both teams.

He took a losing program, that had never had a winning year, to six consecutive winning seasons, a region championship, and five runners-up berths. He was Coach of the Year on four occasions, and had a record of 74-24-4.  He was also director of soccer for the Upson Lee Soccer Association.\n\n'''U.S. Olympic Federation'''\n\nSisterson was hired as women's head soccer coach for the U.S. Deaf Soccer Association in 2003. The team previously had poor results in worldwide tournaments. The goal was to prepare and qualify a team for the 2005 Deaflympics in Melbourne, Australia. Sisterson recruited his new squad throughout the U.S., getting mainly NCAA D1 players. Holding training camps in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and New York, Sisterson delivered immediate results. The team was unbeaten in pre-Olympic games against NCAA university teams, and qualified for the Deaflympics as favorites. Sisterson's team remained undefeated throughout Olympic competition (7-0), beating Great Britain in the quarter final, Denmark in the semi-final, culminating in the defeat of Russia in the Gold Medal game, at the Olympic Stadium in Melbourne.<ref>http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/02/u-s-womens-deaflympic-team-wins-gold-medal-at-2005-deaflympics-in-australia/</ref> Sisterson signed a new contract to lead the team to the 2009 Deaflympics in Chinese Taipei, upon returning from Australia. He selected and trained the squad until 2009, but due to head coaching commitments at Santa Barbara City College, could not attend the Olympics. His assistant, and longtime friend, Ken McDonald, led the team, again unbeaten, to win the Gold Medal.\n\n'''W Texas A&M University'''\n\nSisterson became head assistant at W Texas A&M University in 2004.  He coached both the men's and women's programs, and was the recruiting coordinator. The women's team were NCAA Region Tournament finalists, losing to the eventual national champions. The women's team had a record of 13-6-1, and the men's team, who were also tournament finalists, had a record of 11-7-2. Sisterson resigned as head assistant, to accept a head coaching position in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n'''Santa Barbara City College'''\n\nSisterson was hired as head women's soccer coach in 2005. In 2008, he was also appointed as the head men's soccer coach, by Athletic Director, Mike Warren. Sisterson led the Vaquero women's team to Western State Conference (WSC) championships in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2018 and 2019. In 2017 both the men and women's teams were unbeaten in regular season. In 2014, the team was unbeaten in conference.<ref>http://westernstateconference.com/sports/wsoc/2014-15/releases/20141126moin5v/</ref> This was the first time this had been achieved in the program's history. Prior to Sisterson, the women's team had never won a conference title and was nationally unranked. Under Sisterson's guidance, the women's team has achieved numerous national rankings, as high as 2nd in 2017, 5th in 2008 and 2011 and 6th in 2016. He has also led the team to 13  out of 14 post-season tournament appearances, and has a record of 203-68-51 since 2005. The Vaquero women have been honored with five of the last six Western State Conference Player of the Year awards. His success with the Vaqueros men's team includes winning the Western State Conference championship on four occasions. The men's team were also Final Four participants in 2011 and the Women's team in 2016 and 2017 and in 2017 were State Runners Up.  Under Sisterson's tutelage, the team has produced four Western State Conference Player of the Year recipients. The Vaquero men's team are the all-time winningest in the Western State Conference, and Sisterson has won four WSC titles with a 160-70-48 record . Since 2006, he has achieved a first or second-place position in the WSC, with one of his teams.

Brown and Paban Chandra Saikia(in \"The Dibongiyas\"), the word ''Chu-ti-ya'' is originally derived from the Deori-Chutiya language which means ''natives who live near pure waters''. ''Chu'' meaning for ''pure/good'', ''Ti'' meaning ''water'' and ''Ya'' meaning for ''natives of the land''. It is essentially similar to the way the terms for the Deori clans(Dibangiya, Tengaponiya or Borgoiya) have originated which means residents(denoted by suffix \"Ya\") living near Dibang, Tengapani and Bornoi rivers.<ref>Saikia, P.C. ''The Dibongiyas''. 1976, p. 38.</ref><ref>Brown, W.B. \"An outline grammar of the Deori Chutia language\", p.70.</ref><ref>Rabha, Bishnuprasad \"Rabha Rachanwali(Vol I)\", 1982, p.336.</ref>\n*The Deodhai Buranji mentions the Chutias as ''Chutika'' instead. There is a sloka in the Buranji which reads, {{Quote\n|text=\u201cSadiya Korjaku-Desha Chutika-Bansha Bhirmuka<br />Dhatu Dravya Tu Lebhe Na Hatwa Janpadanaya\u201d\n|author=Deodhai Buranji\n}}<br/>The term Chutika is also of Deori-Chutia origins. ''Chu'' means ''good/pure'' and ''Tika'' stands for ''lineage/origins''. Thus, ''Chu-tika'' could mean ''People of good origins''. On the other hand, ''Chu'' also means ''pig'' in the same language and this would link the Chutias(''pig origin'') to the ''Varaha lineage'' as adopted by the [[Kamarupa]] kings.<ref>Bhuyan, S.K.''Deodhai Assam Buranji(Chutia r Kotha)''.Dept. of Historical and Antiquarian Studies, 1932, p. 5.</ref> It is very possible that the origin word ''Chutika'' later shortened over time to ''Chutia''.\n\n*R.M. Nath in his book \"Background of Assamese culture\" claims that the term is derived from ''chut'' or \"mountain top\", their original place of habitation (after arriving from Sinchuan), before settling down in the plains of Upper Assam.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Momin|first1=Mignonette|last2=Mawlong|first2=Cecile A.|last3=Q\u0101dr\u012b|first3=Fuz\u0324ail A\u1e25mad|title=Society and Economy in North-East India|date=2004|publisher=Regency Publications|isbn=9788189233402|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Djx131iEeYkC&q=Chutiya#v=snippet&q=Chutiya&f=false | quote=\"two main views on the origin of the Chutiyas: (a) that the Chutiyas were so called because they had originally occupied the ''chut'' or mountaintop ...\"}}</ref> But, this is cannot be true as the term \"Chut\" doesn't belong to Deori-Chutia language or any other Bodo dialects.\n\n==Origin==\n\n*There are numerous folklores among the community which points to ancestors ''Bhirmukka'' and ''Subahu-Chutan''. The Deodhai Buranji mentions Birpal to be a descendant of Bhirmukka. It also reads ''\"Sadiya Korjaku-Desha Chutika-Bansha Bhirmukka\"''. As per the Buranji, due to some misfortune(''deva-dosha'') Birpal had to settle down with 60 Chutia families in a hill named ''Swarnagiri/Sonagiri'' in the year 1189 A.D.(1111 saka). As per another folklore of the Chutia priestly community ''Deoris'', Bhirmukka was the descendant of a king named ''Subahu-Chutan''.<ref>Barua, S.L. ''Chutiya Jatir Buranji''. 2004, p. 454.</ref> This ancestor can be identified to be the second last king of [[Bhauma dynasty]] ''Subahu''.<ref>[https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/66653/10/10_chapter%203.pdf ''Subahu was the 20th king after Narakasura']</ref> It is believed that once king ''Subahu-Chutan'', motivated by his desire, wanted to marry goddess ''Pisasi-dema''(Dikkarvasini). When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a stone temple with a copper roof and a stone staircase from the temple to the river within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him. If however he failed the task, he as well his descendants had to forever worship the goddess. Subahu took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. When the king had almost accomplished his task and only the door was left to build, the goddess paniced. In order to prevent Subahu from completing the task, she created a cock out of her own hands and made it crow untimely to give the impression of dawn to Subahu. Duped by the trick, Subahu left the door half way through and promised to worship the goddess till eternity. As the door could not be complete, the Deoris of the temple always leave the door of the temple open. <ref>Bordoloi, Dr. Nirmalprava ''Devi''. 1989, p. 222.</ref><ref>''Deori Sanskriti'',p. 49-50</ref>The Deoris called the Chutia kingdom as ''Chutam''(Land of Chutias).<ref>[http://www.ijrssh.com/images/short_pdf/Jul_2013_LADE%20JAYANT%20DEORAM.pdf (IJRSSH) 2013, Vol. No. 2, Issue No. III, Jul-Sep]</ref> \n\n*Another folklore prevalent among the community notes a hill by the name of ''Sotai-Parvat''. The folklore states that at a very early time, the plains of Assam was a marshland devastated by frequent floods which made the people settle in the hills. The sky was said to be very close to the ground(probably as it was covered by clouds) and this annoyed the people a lot. One day an old women who knew magic attempted to solve the issue, but instead ended up removing the sky completely. This made the place very cold and dark. So, the people migrated from the place and gathered together in a hill named Sotai-Parvat. They stayed there for sometime and then shifted to the plains due to some reason. One group crossed a mighty river(probably Brahmaputra) and the other did not. This is how the Chutias scattered around the region. It is interesting to note that there still exists a hill named ''Sotai pahar'' in today's [[Sonitpur district]] (previously known as Hadappesvara).<ref>[https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/north-east/road-work-threat-to-wildlife-bro-hill-cutting-puts-habitat-of-sonitpur-animal-reserves-in-danger/cid/492192 ''\"..Sotai Pahar, which is a part of Balipara reserve forest on the western side of the road.\"'']</ref> The Deoris sing in their Bisu(Bihu) songs,\n{{Quote|text=\u201cSeng seng maruwa harali e.<br />Pindhe jai emola kutumbar e.<br />Kuwari pindhise keruna e, hei heya.<br />Sotai parvatat Bijuli marise,<br />Kuwarik paisu dekhi na e hei heya.\u201d}}{{Quote|text=\u201cSotai parvatar Dhuwali-kuwali<br />Kune bhat randhi khai,<br />Maak nai mawra tiri nai borola<br />Hati dhoriboloi jai.\"}}{{Quote|text=\u201cThoi ki nothoi thoi.<br />Era bandhe dhan e dhemeliya.<br />Sotai parvatat Dhuwali-kuwali dhan e dhemeliya.<br />Kune bhate randhe khale harilare<br />Dhan e dhemeliya.\u201d}}There is a mention of a group of people named ''Sesatai'' (known to [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] as ''Saesadai'' or ''Sosaeadae'') in ancient Greek texts. They were described \u2013 in terms similar to descriptions of the Kirradai \u2013 as short and flat-faced, but also shaggy and white. They are said to have lived in the north of Arakan region of Myanmar, east of Bengal(Ganges) and were mentioned to be involved in trade of the aromatic plant [[malabathrum]], betel nut and other items of value between China, Arakan, and Bengal. It is probable that it was the Chutias(pronounced as Sutia) from Sotai hills who are referred in the texts.<ref>\"Ptolemy calls them ''Saesadai'' and describes them more fully; they are not only short and flat-faced, as in the Periplus, but shaggy and white-skinned. ... The characteristics themselves indicate that the Sesatai were similar to the Kirradai, and their access to the border with China indicates that they lived, as Coedes suggests 'between Bengal and China'\". {{harv|Casson|1989|pp=242\u2013243}}</ref><ref>\"In any situation which may be supposed to be that assigned by Ptolemy, the ihnabitants were advantageously situated for carrying on the trade btween Bengal, Arracan and China.\",''Sketch of the Commercial Intercourse of the World with China''</ref>.\n\n==Chutiya rule (1187-1673)==\n\n{{Main|Chutiya Kingdom}}\n\n[[File: SutiyaWarrior.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A 15th century statue of a Chutiya warrior.]]\n\nThe Chutiya Kingdom was established by Birpal in 1187 on the northern bank of the river Brahmaputra. The kingdom absorbed the ancient Pal dynasty and reigned for over 400 years in northeastern Assam and areas of present-day Arunachal Pradesh, with the capital at Sadiya. The kingdom controlled the entire region of present Assam districts of [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]], [[Dhemaji district|Dhemaji]], [[Tinsukia district|Tinsukia]] and parts of [[Jorhat district|Jorhat]], [[Dibrugarh district|Dibrugarh]], [[Sonitpur district|Sonitpur]].\n\nIt was the dominant kingdom in upper Assam till the 16th century in which it expanded from Parshuram Kund in the east to Vishwanath in the west and had absorbed many local communities and tribes. Most illustrious of the Chutiya kings was Gaurinarayan (Ratnadhwajpal), son of Birpal. He brought many other Chutiya groups into his kingdom. In 1224 Ratnadhwajpal defeated Bhadrasena, the king of Swetagiri. Then he went on to subjugate Nyayapal and marched toward Kamatapur, where he formed an alliance with the Kamata ruler by marrying a princess. Then he marched to Dhaka, and made friends with the Gauda ruler.\n\nThe hostilities with the Ahoms began when the Chutiya Kingdom expanded to the south and during which Ahom king, Sutuphaa, was killed by the Chutiya king during a friendly negotiation.This conflict triggered a number of battles between the two sides, which saw great loss of men and money. The simmering dispute often flared till 1523 when the Ahoms struck the Chutiya Kingdom in its weakest state, they finally took Sadiya and killed the then king Nityapal. The Ahoms established their rule by instituting the position of Sadiyakhowa Gohain, the governor in charge of Sadiya. But the Chutiya had dispersed to frontier regions, and continued raids against the Ahoms.

Up to this time the Ahoms weapons consisted of swords, spears and bows and arrows. The Chutiyas were defeated in 1524 which shows that the Ahoms learned the use of gunpowder from the Chutias. This is further corroborated by the fact that all the ''Hiloidari''(cannonmen)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/3_20190901_20190901 ''Naoboicha Phukanar Buranji'',p.55]</ref> and majority of ''Hiloi-Khanikars''(gunmakers) belonged to the Chutia community. It is believed that the gunpowder and firearms in this part of India was of a better quality than rest of India. It is known that when [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]] went back from Assam he took with him 675 big guns and about 4750 maunds of gunpowder in boxes because they were in much better quality than what they used.\n\n[[File:A terracotta tile of Bhismaknagar depicting a person with a hand-cannon.png|thumb|A terracotta tile of Bhismaknagar depicting a person with a crossbow or a hand-cannon]]\n\n[[File:Mithaholong Bortop.jpg|thumb|This is one of the Mithaholong guns which the Ahoms procured after defeating the Chutias.]]\n\n==Language==\n\nThe original language of the Chutias belong to the [[Tibeto-Burman]] [[Bodo-Garo languages]] group, also known by the same name i.e. Chutiya. Although, the language is no longer spoken by majority of Chutias, it is well preserved by the Deori people or the priestly section of the group.<ref>Brown, W.B. ''An Outline Grammar of the Deori-Chutiya language''. 1933, p.3 .</ref> According to W.B.Brown, the Chutia language was the original language of Upper Assam.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = William Barclays\n  | title = An Outline grammar of the Deori Chutiya language spoken in Upper Assam\n  | date=2015 |orig-year=1895\n  | location = Shillong \n}}</ref> According to PRT Gurdon(1903), the [[Deori language|Deori-Chutia language]] is very similar to the [[Moran language|Moran]] dialect of Assamese and it can well be stated that the Moran language was nothing but a transitionary language between Chutia and Assamese language for the [[Chutiya people|Chutias]], Morans, and a section of [[Deori people|Deoris]](Tengaponia, Borgoya).\n\nAs per the linguist H.A.Gleason, if two languages share around 66% of words, it indicates that the languages have been separated for 1000 years; and if they have 44% common words, it denotes 2000 years of separation. The Boro and Chutia languages share around 55\u201360% of words which indicates that the two tribes must have separated 1200\u20131500 years ago.<ref>Gleason, H.A.

This was probably the time when the first form of Assamese originated in Upper Assam. The old Chutiya language was preserved by the Deori priestly section.\n\nThis is the stone inscription of Chutia King Dharmanarayan from 1442 AD found in the Tamreswari Copper Temple in Sadiya.

According to Ahom buranjis, this form of Assamese along with the original Chutiya language were the only languages to have a writing script when they arrived.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThis form of Assamese was then adopted by the Ahom courts and spread throughout the kingdom. They used this form combined with Tai influence to form the Gargaya Assamese used in later Buranjis. The modern written form of Assamese is mostly influenced by the Gargaya branch of Assamese.<ref>Yasmin Saikia in her book ''Assam and India: Fragmented  Memories'' mentioned Sadiya, capital of the Chutiya kingdom to be one of the two important centers of development for the Assamese language.{{Harv|Saikia|2004|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\nIn the early medieval period, the Chutiyas followed a form of tribal tantric religion closely related to [[Buddhism]] i.e. [[Bon]] before adopting [[Hinduism]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FIA8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183&lpg=PA183&dq=chutiya+tantric+worship&source=bl&ots=GonL3lpS48&sig=ACfU3U2fKJyLZp1pGsz8ar7xFF1aNwBJSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1qt-6u97gAhVLFHIKHfm2BqEQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ Chutias followed a tribal tantric  cult]</ref> During the rule of the Chutiya dynasty, they worshipped various forms of Kali with the help of their tribal priests, Deuris. Their favourite form of worshipping this deity was that of ''Kesai Khaiti''. A crude form of Hinduism became the state religion at a very early time and influence of tantric form of ''Shaktism'' was felt in the royal court. Human sacrifices of criminals was offered to tutelary Goddess, ''Khesai Khati'' and pilgrims from region far more remote i.e. Tibet and China brought their offerings as a token of faith for ''Tantricism''.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=911\u2013916}}\n\n[[File:Dharma Husori.jpg|thumb|Chutia Dharma Husori performed in Borgaon, Tinsukia]]\n\nIn modern times, the majority of Chutiyas are followers of Hinduism and [[Ekasarana Dharma]], a pantheistic religion founded and propagated by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] during the 15th century in Assam.\n\n==Subdivisions==\n\n===Clans===\n\nChutiyas are originally divided into different clans/''bangshas'' which were based on descendants of a common ancestor. These ''Bangshas'' were divided into ''Khels'' which were professional classes like ''Now-Holiya'', ''Jaapi-hojiya'', ''Lahing'', ''Bebejia'', etc. ''Khels'' were further divided into ''Foids''.<ref>Barua, S.L.

Over time, Chutiyas divided into five important groups:<ref>{{Harvcol|Guptajit Pathak|pp=82}}</ref>\n\n* Hindu Chutiya\n* Ahom Chutiya\n* Borahi Chutiya\n* Miri Chutiya\n* Deori Chutiya\n\nThe Hindu Chutiyas represented a large section of the population. These are the Chutiyas who were initiated by Vaishnavite saints like Shankardev, Madhavdev into Vaishnavism sect of Hinduism. They are popularly termed as ''Kesa-ponthi'' as they have been imposed certain restrictions like use of animal meat and alcohols in their rites by the Vaishnavite community. The other group ''Poka-ponthi'' have retained their tribal customs in their original form.<ref>Khanikar, Surjya kanta  ''Chutiya Jaatir Itihax aru Luko-Sanskriti''.1991, p. 215.</ref> Among the Pokaponthis, the Ahom Chutiyas formed the major sub-division. They were termed as such as they intermarried with the Ahoms and held different position in administration of the Ahom kingdom as seen with Momai Tamuli Borbarua and [[Lachit Borphukan]].\n\nThe Borahi Chutiyas are a sub-group of Chutiyas who had certain religious rites different from other Chutiyas. Presently they are found in the [[Dhemaji district|Dhemaji]], [[Golaghat district|Golaghat]] and [[Sibsagar district|Sibsagar]] districts. Miri Chutiyas were the Chutiyas who lived in the bordering villages of the northern bank of Brahmapurtra and fled to the Miri hills during the Ahom invasions. They intermarried with the Miris and were subsequently absorbed by the later. They chiefly belonged to the Bihia, Buruk(Medok) and Bebejia clans.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=L1i51KFUyzIC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=chutiya+tribe+customs&source=bl&ots=wgEjVgb9Lw&sig=ACfU3U31PYmJoCwH4pVRyh5-B2uIzm4QhQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT0ZHI_cPgAhXbfX0KHbx3CEM4ChDoATAEegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=chutiya%20tribe%20customs&f=false Miri Chutiyas explained in \"Society and Economy in North-East India\"]</ref> [[Deori people|Deori Chutiyas]] were originally the priests of the Chutiya people.

The royals and the rich in the past wore clothes made out of Muga and Paat Silk, whereas the ordinary class wore Cotton(summers) and Eri Silk(winter). In the ancient times, royal men wore jewelry items like Longkeru(Earrings), Mota Moni(necklace) as well as golden footwear(Paduka). The royals also used silk umbrellas with gold embroidery known as ''Gunakara''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.451525/page/n399 Khanikar, Surjyakanta, ''Chutia Jatir Itihas Aru Loka-sanskriti'',p. 383-384]</ref>\n\n[[File:Traditional Chutia Sula(Shirt) made of Eri Silk.jpg|thumb|Traditional Chutia Sula(Shirt) made of Eri Silk]]\n\n====Women Attire====\n\nWomen are treated with utmost respect in the Chutia community.

These could be either Muga/Paat(rich class) or Cotton /Eri(ordinary class).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/3_20190901_20190901, Padmeswar Naoboicha Phukan, Assam Buranji, p.30, ''As mentioned in the text, one of the Ahom kings adopted Muga and Paatin their royal courts by recruiting about 1000 Muga weavers from the Chutia community which shows the importance of Muga among Chutias'']</ref> This style of clothing is known as Methoni. After puberty and until Marriage, the girls wore Riha instead of Baiga as the upper garment. This custom to change the clothing style after puberty is a tradition of the tribe. During marriage, the bride wears Paat/Muga Riha along with Mekhela and chador. The chador is a sign of marriage. Other clothing like Mejankari are also worn. Among the jewelry, the bride wore necklaces like Dukdugi, Gejera, Junbiri, Medali/Madoli, earrings like Koria, Thuria, etc. The bride also wore Harudai Jaapi as a headgear. The married women usually wear a Chador and a Gamusa/Gathigi to cover their forehead. The old women had their own style of clothing. They wore the mekhela up to their bosom and tied another cloth in their waist.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.451525/page/n399 Khanikar, Surjyakanta, ''Chutia Jatir Itihas Aru Loka-sanskriti'',p. 384-389]</ref>\n\nOther clothes worn include Borkapur, Cheleng sador, Tongali, etc.\n\n==Notes==\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Shin|first1=Jae-Eun|year=2020|title=Descending from demons, ascending to kshatriyas: Genealogical claims and political process in pre-modern Northeast India, The Chutiyas and the Dimasas|journal=The Indian Economic and Social History Review|volume=57|issue=1|pages=49\u201375|doi=10.1177/0019464619894134|via=|url=}}\n*{{citation\n  | first = Col.

Brown and Paban Chandra Saikia(in \"The Dibongiyas\"), the word ''Chu-ti-ya'' is originally derived from the Deori-Chutiya language which means ''natives who live near pure waters''. ''Chu'' meaning for ''pure/good'', ''Ti'' meaning ''water'' and ''Ya'' meaning for ''natives of the land''. It is essentially similar to the way the terms for the Deori clans(Dibangiya, Tengaponiya or Borgoiya) have originated which means residents(denoted by suffix \"Ya\") living near Dibang, Tengapani and Bornoi rivers.<ref>Saikia, P.C. ''The Dibongiyas''. 1976, p. 38.</ref><ref>Brown, W.B. \"An outline grammar of the Deori Chutia language\", p.70.</ref><ref>Rabha, Bishnuprasad \"Rabha Rachanwali(Vol I)\", 1982, p.336.</ref>\n*The Deodhai Buranji mentions the Chutias as ''Chutika'' instead. There is a sloka in the Buranji which reads, {{Quote\n|text=\u201cSadiya Korjaku-Desha Chutika-Bansha Bhirmuka<br />Dhatu Dravya Tu Lebhe Na Hatwa Janpadanaya\u201d\n|author=Deodhai Buranji\n}}<br/>The term Chutika is also of Deori-Chutia origins. ''Chu'' means ''good/pure'' and ''Tika'' stands for ''lineage/origins''. Thus, ''Chu-tika'' could mean ''People of good origins''. On the other hand, ''Chu'' also means ''pig'' in the same language and this would link the Chutias(''pig origin'') to the ''Varaha lineage'' as adopted by the [[Kamarupa]] kings.<ref>Bhuyan, S.K.''Deodhai Assam Buranji(Chutia r Kotha)''.Dept. of Historical and Antiquarian Studies, 1932, p. 5.</ref> It is very possible that the origin word ''Chutika'' later shortened over time to ''Chutia''.\n\n*R.M. Nath in his book \"Background of Assamese culture\" claims that the term is derived from ''chut'' or \"mountain top\", their original place of habitation (after arriving from Sinchuan), before settling down in the plains of Upper Assam.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Momin|first1=Mignonette|last2=Mawlong|first2=Cecile A.|last3=Q\u0101dr\u012b|first3=Fuz\u0324ail A\u1e25mad|title=Society and Economy in North-East India|date=2004|publisher=Regency Publications|isbn=9788189233402|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Djx131iEeYkC&q=Chutiya#v=snippet&q=Chutiya&f=false | quote=\"two main views on the origin of the Chutiyas: (a) that the Chutiyas were so called because they had originally occupied the ''chut'' or mountaintop ...\"}}</ref> But, this is cannot be true as the term \"Chut\" doesn't belong to Deori-Chutia language or any other Bodo dialects.\n\n==Origin==\n\n*There are numerous folklores among the community which points to ancestors ''Bhirmukka'' and ''Subahu-Chutan''. The Deodhai Buranji mentions Birpal to be a descendant of Bhirmukka. It also reads ''\"Sadiya Korjaku-Desha Chutika-Bansha Bhirmukka\"''. As per the Buranji, due to some misfortune(''deva-dosha'') Birpal had to settle down with 60 Chutia families in a hill named ''Swarnagiri/Sonagiri'' in the year 1189 A.D.(1111 saka). As per another folklore of the Chutia priestly community ''Deoris'', Bhirmukka was the descendant of a king named ''Subahu-Chutan''.<ref>Barua, S.L. ''Chutiya Jatir Buranji''. 2004, p. 454.</ref> This ancestor can be identified to be the second last king of [[Bhauma dynasty]] ''Subahu''.<ref>[https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/66653/10/10_chapter%203.pdf ''Subahu was the 20th king after Narakasura']</ref> It is believed that once king ''Subahu-Chutan'', motivated by his desire, wanted to marry goddess ''Pisasi-dema''(Dikkarvasini). When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a stone temple with a copper roof and a stone staircase from the temple to the river within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him. If however he failed the task, he as well his descendants had to forever worship the goddess. Subahu took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. When the king had almost accomplished his task and only the door was left to build, the goddess paniced. In order to prevent Subahu from completing the task, she created a cock out of her own hands and made it crow untimely to give the impression of dawn to Subahu. Duped by the trick, Subahu left the door half way through and promised to worship the goddess till eternity. As the door could not be complete, the Deoris of the temple always leave the door of the temple open. <ref>Bordoloi, Dr. Nirmalprava ''Devi''. 1989, p. 222.</ref><ref>''Deori Sanskriti'',p. 49-50</ref>The Deoris called the Chutia kingdom as ''Chutam''(Land of Chutias).<ref>[http://www.ijrssh.com/images/short_pdf/Jul_2013_LADE%20JAYANT%20DEORAM.pdf (IJRSSH) 2013, Vol. No. 2, Issue No. III, Jul-Sep]</ref> \n\n*Another folklore prevalent among the community notes a hill by the name of ''Sotai-Parvat''. The folklore states that at a very early time, the plains of Assam was a marshland devastated by frequent floods which made the people settle in the hills. The sky was said to be very close to the ground(probably as it was covered by clouds) and this annoyed the people a lot. One day an old women who knew magic attempted to solve the issue, but instead ended up removing the sky completely. This made the place very cold and dark. So, the people migrated from the place and gathered together in a hill named Sotai-Parvat. They stayed there for sometime and then shifted to the plains due to some reason. One group crossed a mighty river(probably Brahmaputra) and the other did not. This is how the Chutias scattered around the region.

They are said to have lived in the north of Arakan region of Myanmar, east of Bengal(Ganges) and were mentioned to be involved in trade of the aromatic plant [[malabathrum]], betel nut and other items of value between China, Arakan, and Bengal. It is probable that it was the Chutias(pronounced as Sutia) from Sotai hills who are referred in the texts.<ref>\"Ptolemy calls them ''Saesadai'' and describes them more fully; they are not only short and flat-faced, as in the Periplus, but shaggy and white-skinned. ... The characteristics themselves indicate that the Sesatai were similar to the Kirradai, and their access to the border with China indicates that they lived, as Coedes suggests 'between Bengal and China'\". {{harv|Casson|1989|pp=242\u2013243}}</ref><ref>\"In any situation which may be supposed to be that assigned by Ptolemy, the ihnabitants were advantageously situated for carrying on the trade btween Bengal, Arracan and China.\",''Sketch of the Commercial Intercourse of the World with China''</ref>.\n\n==Chutiya rule (1187-1673)==\n\n{{Main|Chutiya Kingdom}}\n\n[[File: SutiyaWarrior.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A 15th century statue of a Chutiya warrior.]]\n\nThe Chutiya Kingdom was established by Birpal in 1187 on the northern bank of the river Brahmaputra. The kingdom absorbed the ancient Pal dynasty and reigned for over 400 years in northeastern Assam and areas of present-day Arunachal Pradesh, with the capital at Sadiya. The kingdom controlled the entire region of present Assam districts of [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]], [[Dhemaji district|Dhemaji]], [[Tinsukia district|Tinsukia]] and parts of [[Jorhat district|Jorhat]], [[Dibrugarh district|Dibrugarh]], [[Sonitpur district|Sonitpur]].\n\nIt was the dominant kingdom in upper Assam till the 16th century in which it expanded from Parshuram Kund in the east to Vishwanath in the west and had absorbed many local communities and tribes. Most illustrious of the Chutiya kings was Gaurinarayan (Ratnadhwajpal), son of Birpal. He brought many other Chutiya groups into his kingdom. In 1224 Ratnadhwajpal defeated Bhadrasena, the king of Swetagiri. Then he went on to subjugate Nyayapal and marched toward Kamatapur, where he formed an alliance with the Kamata ruler by marrying a princess. Then he marched to Dhaka, and made friends with the Gauda ruler.\n\nThe hostilities with the Ahoms began when the Chutiya Kingdom expanded to the south and during which Ahom king, Sutuphaa, was killed by the Chutiya king during a friendly negotiation.This conflict triggered a number of battles between the two sides, which saw great loss of men and money. The simmering dispute often flared till 1523 when the Ahoms struck the Chutiya Kingdom in its weakest state, they finally took Sadiya and killed the then king Nityapal. The Ahoms established their rule by instituting the position of Sadiyakhowa Gohain, the governor in charge of Sadiya. But the Chutiya had dispersed to frontier regions, and continued raids against the Ahoms. It finally ended in 1673, when the Chutiyas fall under the domination of the Ahoms.\n\n[[File:Chutia Kekura Dola.jpg|thumb|Chutia Kekura Dola(Palaquin) donated by king Satyanarayan to the Gharmora Satra.]]\n\n===Gunpowder and Cannons===\n\nThe Chutias were the first people in Assam to use firearms. When the Ahoms annexed Sadiya, they recovered hand-cannons called ''Hiloi''<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.336000/page/n49/mode/1up S.K.

Up to this time the Ahoms weapons consisted of swords, spears and bows and arrows. The Chutiyas were defeated in 1524 which shows that the Ahoms learned the use of gunpowder from the Chutias. This is further corroborated by the fact that all the ''Hiloidari''(cannonmen)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/3_20190901_20190901 ''Naoboicha Phukanar Buranji'',p.55]</ref> and majority of ''Hiloi-Khanikars''(gunmakers) belonged to the Chutia community. It is believed that the gunpowder and firearms in this part of India was of a better quality than rest of India. It is known that when [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]] went back from Assam he took with him 675 big guns and about 4750 maunds of gunpowder in boxes because they were in much better quality than what they used.\n\n[[File:A terracotta tile of Bhismaknagar depicting a person with a hand-cannon.png|thumb|A terracotta tile of Bhismaknagar depicting a person with a crossbow or a hand-cannon]]\n\n[[File:Mithaholong Bortop.jpg|thumb|This is one of the Mithaholong guns which the Ahoms procured after defeating the Chutias.]]\n\n==Language==\n\nThe original language of the Chutias belong to the [[Tibeto-Burman]] [[Bodo-Garo languages]] group, also known by the same name i.e. Chutiya. Although, the language is no longer spoken by majority of Chutias, it is well preserved by the Deori people or the priestly section of the group.<ref>Brown, W.B. ''An Outline Grammar of the Deori-Chutiya language''. 1933, p.3 .</ref> According to W.B.Brown, the Chutia language was the original language of Upper Assam.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = William Barclays\n  | title = An Outline grammar of the Deori Chutiya language spoken in Upper Assam\n  | date=2015 |orig-year=1895\n  | location = Shillong \n}}</ref> According to PRT Gurdon(1903), the [[Deori language|Deori-Chutia language]] is very similar to the [[Moran language|Moran]] dialect of Assamese and it can well be stated that the Moran language was nothing but a transitionary language between Chutia and Assamese language for the [[Chutiya people|Chutias]], Morans, and a section of [[Deori people|Deoris]](Tengaponia, Borgoya).\n\nAs per the linguist H.A.Gleason, if two languages share around 66% of words, it indicates that the languages have been separated for 1000 years; and if they have 44% common words, it denotes 2000 years of separation. The Boro and Chutia languages share around 55\u201360% of words which indicates that the two tribes must have separated 1200\u20131500 years ago.<ref>Gleason, H.A. ''An Introduction to Descriptive Linguistics''. 1974, p. 450.</ref><ref>Baruah, Swarnalata. ''Chutia Jaatir Buranji''.2007, p. 318.</ref>\n\nAfter the advent of Prakrit in the Brahmaputra valley, the language of the Chutias evolved and assimilated with the Prakrit language. This was probably the time when the first form of Assamese originated in Upper Assam. The old Chutiya language was preserved by the Deori priestly section.\n\nThis is the stone inscription of Chutia King Dharmanarayan from 1442 AD found in the Tamreswari Copper Temple in Sadiya. It declares the renovation of the temple using bricks.\n\n[[File:Stone inscription of Chutia king Dharmanarayan dated 1442 A.D. found in Paya-Tamreswari temple.jpg|thumb|Stone inscription of Chutia king Dharmanarayan dated 1442 A.D. found in Paya-Tamreswari temple]]\n\nWhen the Ahoms arrived in the 13th century, they found the Chutiya language to be a version of localised Prakrit with a Prakrit script. According to Ahom buranjis, this form of Assamese along with the original Chutiya language were the only languages to have a writing script when they arrived.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThis form of Assamese was then adopted by the Ahom courts and spread throughout the kingdom. They used this form combined with Tai influence to form the Gargaya Assamese used in later Buranjis. The modern written form of Assamese is mostly influenced by the Gargaya branch of Assamese.<ref>Yasmin Saikia in her book ''Assam and India: Fragmented  Memories'' mentioned Sadiya, capital of the Chutiya kingdom to be one of the two important centers of development for the Assamese language.{{Harv|Saikia|2004|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\nIn the early medieval period, the Chutiyas followed a form of tribal tantric religion closely related to [[Buddhism]] i.e. [[Bon]] before adopting [[Hinduism]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FIA8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183&lpg=PA183&dq=chutiya+tantric+worship&source=bl&ots=GonL3lpS48&sig=ACfU3U2fKJyLZp1pGsz8ar7xFF1aNwBJSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1qt-6u97gAhVLFHIKHfm2BqEQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ Chutias followed a tribal tantric  cult]</ref> During the rule of the Chutiya dynasty, they worshipped various forms of Kali with the help of their tribal priests, Deuris. Their favourite form of worshipping this deity was that of ''Kesai Khaiti''. A crude form of Hinduism became the state religion at a very early time and influence of tantric form of ''Shaktism'' was felt in the royal court. Human sacrifices of criminals was offered to tutelary Goddess, ''Khesai Khati'' and pilgrims from region far more remote i.e. Tibet and China brought their offerings as a token of faith for ''Tantricism''.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=911\u2013916}}\n\n[[File:Dharma Husori.jpg|thumb|Chutia Dharma Husori performed in Borgaon, Tinsukia]]\n\nIn modern times, the majority of Chutiyas are followers of Hinduism and [[Ekasarana Dharma]], a pantheistic religion founded and propagated by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] during the 15th century in Assam.\n\n==Subdivisions==\n\n===Clans===\n\nChutiyas are originally divided into different clans/''bangshas'' which were based on descendants of a common ancestor. These ''Bangshas'' were divided into ''Khels'' which were professional classes like ''Now-Holiya'', ''Jaapi-hojiya'', ''Lahing'', ''Bebejia'', etc. ''Khels'' were further divided into ''Foids''.<ref>Barua, S.L.

Over time, Chutiyas divided into five important groups:<ref>{{Harvcol|Guptajit Pathak|pp=82}}</ref>\n\n* Hindu Chutiya\n* Ahom Chutiya\n* Borahi Chutiya\n* Miri Chutiya\n* Deori Chutiya\n\nThe Hindu Chutiyas represented a large section of the population. These are the Chutiyas who were initiated by Vaishnavite saints like Shankardev, Madhavdev into Vaishnavism sect of Hinduism. They are popularly termed as ''Kesa-ponthi'' as they have been imposed certain restrictions like use of animal meat and alcohols in their rites by the Vaishnavite community. The other group ''Poka-ponthi'' have retained their tribal customs in their original form.<ref>Khanikar, Surjya kanta  ''Chutiya Jaatir Itihax aru Luko-Sanskriti''.1991, p. 215.</ref> Among the Pokaponthis, the Ahom Chutiyas formed the major sub-division. They were termed as such as they intermarried with the Ahoms and held different position in administration of the Ahom kingdom as seen with Momai Tamuli Borbarua and [[Lachit Borphukan]].\n\nThe Borahi Chutiyas are a sub-group of Chutiyas who had certain religious rites different from other Chutiyas. Presently they are found in the [[Dhemaji district|Dhemaji]], [[Golaghat district|Golaghat]] and [[Sibsagar district|Sibsagar]] districts. Miri Chutiyas were the Chutiyas who lived in the bordering villages of the northern bank of Brahmapurtra and fled to the Miri hills during the Ahom invasions. They intermarried with the Miris and were subsequently absorbed by the later. They chiefly belonged to the Bihia, Buruk(Medok) and Bebejia clans.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=L1i51KFUyzIC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=chutiya+tribe+customs&source=bl&ots=wgEjVgb9Lw&sig=ACfU3U31PYmJoCwH4pVRyh5-B2uIzm4QhQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT0ZHI_cPgAhXbfX0KHbx3CEM4ChDoATAEegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=chutiya%20tribe%20customs&f=false Miri Chutiyas explained in \"Society and Economy in North-East India\"]</ref> [[Deori people|Deori Chutiyas]] were originally the priests of the Chutiya people.

The royals and the rich in the past wore clothes made out of Muga and Paat Silk, whereas the ordinary class wore Cotton(summers) and Eri Silk(winter). In the ancient times, royal men wore jewelry items like Longkeru(Earrings), Mota Moni(necklace) as well as golden footwear(Paduka). The royals also used silk umbrellas with gold embroidery known as ''Gunakara''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.451525/page/n399 Khanikar, Surjyakanta, ''Chutia Jatir Itihas Aru Loka-sanskriti'',p. 383-384]</ref>\n\n[[File:Traditional Chutia Sula(Shirt) made of Eri Silk.jpg|thumb|Traditional Chutia Sula(Shirt) made of Eri Silk]]\n\n====Women Attire====\n\nWomen are treated with utmost respect in the Chutia community. Every age group had their own unique clothing style. Girls until puberty wore a Gamusa called Baiga as an upper garment and a Mekhela(Bika Mariba) as a lower garment. These could be either Muga/Paat(rich class) or Cotton /Eri(ordinary class).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/3_20190901_20190901, Padmeswar Naoboicha Phukan, Assam Buranji, p.30, ''As mentioned in the text, one of the Ahom kings adopted Muga and Paatin their royal courts by recruiting about 1000 Muga weavers from the Chutia community which shows the importance of Muga among Chutias'']</ref> This style of clothing is known as Methoni. After puberty and until Marriage, the girls wore Riha instead of Baiga as the upper garment. This custom to change the clothing style after puberty is a tradition of the tribe. During marriage, the bride wears Paat/Muga Riha along with Mekhela and chador. The chador is a sign of marriage. Other clothing like Mejankari are also worn. Among the jewelry, the bride wore necklaces like Dukdugi, Gejera, Junbiri, Medali/Madoli, earrings like Koria, Thuria, etc. The bride also wore Harudai Jaapi as a headgear. The married women usually wear a Chador and a Gamusa/Gathigi to cover their forehead. The old women had their own style of clothing. They wore the mekhela up to their bosom and tied another cloth in their waist.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.451525/page/n399 Khanikar, Surjyakanta, ''Chutia Jatir Itihas Aru Loka-sanskriti'',p. 384-389]</ref>\n\nOther clothes worn include Borkapur, Cheleng sador, Tongali, etc.\n\n==Notes==\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Shin|first1=Jae-Eun|year=2020|title=Descending from demons, ascending to kshatriyas: Genealogical claims and political process in pre-modern Northeast India, The Chutiyas and the Dimasas|journal=The Indian Economic and Social History Review|volume=57|issue=1|pages=49\u201375|doi=10.1177/0019464619894134|via=|url=}}\n*{{citation\n  | first = Col.
