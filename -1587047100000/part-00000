They were placed in high risk locations and fought in the battle that took the city of Anzio in Italy]]\nThe '''Battle of Anzio''' was a battle of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]] that took place from January 22, 1944 (beginning with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] amphibious landing known as '''Operation Shingle''') to June 5, 1944 (ending  with the capture of Rome). The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]].<ref>At the time joined in a single ''[[comune]]'' called [[Nettunia]]. See: {{in lang|it}} ''Nettunia'', Treccani.it [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/nettunia_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/].</ref> ''Nettuno'' was the German name for the ''Battle of Anzio.''<ref>{{cite book |last=  Margaritis |first= Peter |title= Countdown to D-Day: The German perspective |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2019 |publisher= Casemate |location= Oxford, UK & PA, USA |isbn= 978-1-61200-769-4 |oclc= |page= 103 |pages=  }}</ref>\n\nThe operation was initially commanded by Major General [[John P. Lucas]], of the [[U.S. Army]], commanding [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]] with the intention being to outflank German forces at the [[Winter Line]] and enable an attack on [[Rome]].\n\nThe success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed [[marshland]] and surrounded by mountains, depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], commander of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], understood that risk, but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate, {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Lucas, who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack. The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome. However, Lucas, who had little confidence in the operation as planned, failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength.\n\nWhile Lucas consolidated, Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]], the German commander in the Italian theatre, moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the [[beachhead]]. His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position. The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water, planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by [[epidemic]]. For weeks a rain of shells fell on the beach, the marsh, the harbour, and on anything else observable from the hills, with little distinction between forward and rear positions.\n\nAfter a month of heavy but inconclusive fighting, Lucas was relieved and sent home. His replacement was Major General [[Lucian Truscott]], who had previously commanded the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. The Allies broke out in May. But, instead of striking inland to cut lines of communication of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Tenth Army]]'s units [[Battle of Monte Cassino|fighting at Monte Cassino]], Truscott, on Clark's orders, reluctantly turned his forces north-west towards Rome, which was captured on June 4, 1944. As a result, the forces of the German Tenth Army fighting at Cassino were able to withdraw and rejoin the rest of Kesselring's forces north of Rome, regroup, and make a fighting withdrawal to his next major prepared defensive position on the [[Gothic Line]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\nAt the end of 1943, following the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], Allied forces were bogged down at the [[Gustav Line]], a defensive line across Italy south of the strategic objective of Rome. The [[Geography of Italy|terrain of central Italy]] had proved ideally suited to defense, and Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] took full advantage.\n\nOperation Shingle was originally conceived by British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in December 1943, as he lay recovering from [[pneumonia]] in [[Marrakesh]]. His concept was to land two divisions at Anzio, bypassing German forces in central Italy, and take Rome, the strategic objective of the current Battle of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=321}}</ref> By January he had recovered and was badgering his commanders for a plan of attack, accusing them of not wanting to fight but of being interested only in drawing pay and eating rations.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=322}}</ref> General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], had already considered such a plan since October using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have the troops nor the means to transport them. Clark proposed landing a reinforced division to divert German troops from [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. This second landing, however, instead of failing similarly{{clarify|date=April 2018}}, would hold <ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Anzio|url=http://www.worldwar2facts.org/battle-of-anzio.html|work=World War II Facts|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> \"the shingle\" for a week in expectation of a breakthrough at Cassino, and so the operation was named Shingle.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=323}}</ref>\n\nThe Anzio beachhead is at the northwestern end of a tract of reclaimed marshland, formerly the [[Pontine Marshes]], now the Pontine Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying [[malaria]], in Roman times armies marched as quickly as possible across it on the military road, the [[Via Appia]]. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and on others by mountains: the Monti Albani, the [[Monti Lepini]], the [[Monti Ausoni]] and further south the [[Monti Aurunci]] (where the allies had been brought to a halt before [[Monte Cassino]]). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of [[Lazio]], the ancient [[Latium]]. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the [[Via Latina]], running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, risking entrapment. The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under [[Benito Mussolini]]. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from north Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.\n\nWhen [[Lucian Truscott]]'s [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Division]] was first selected for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap and there would be no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. Apparently the two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. [[Allied Forces Headquarters|Mediterranean Theatre]] commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], leaving to take command of [[Operation Overlord]], left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=324}}</ref> \n\nThe final plan called for Lucas to lead the US [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] in a landing in the Anzio area, followed by an advance into the [[Alban Hills]], to cut German communications and \"threaten the rear of the German XIV [[Panzer Corps]]\"{{cn|date=October 2019}} (under [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]]). It was hoped that such an advance would draw German forces away from the Monte Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough there.\n\n==Plan==\nPlanners argued that if Kesselring (in charge of German forces in Italy) pulled troops out of the [[Gustav Line]] to defend against the Allied assault, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line; if Kesselring didn't pull troops out of the Gustav Line, then Operation Shingle would threaten to capture Rome and cut off the German units defending the Gustav Line. Should Germany have adequate reinforcements available to defend both Rome and the Gustav Line, the Allies felt that the operation would nevertheless be useful in engaging forces which could otherwise be committed on another front. The operation was officially canceled on December 18, 1943. However, it was later reselected.\n\nClark did not feel he had the numbers on the southern front to exploit any breakthrough. His plan therefore was relying on the southern offensive drawing Kesselring's reserves in and providing the Anzio force the opportunity to break inland quickly. This would also reflect the orders he had received from Alexander to \"...{{nbsp}}carry out an assault landing on the beaches in the vicinity of Rome with the object of cutting the enemy lines of communication and threatening the rear of the German XIV&nbsp;Corps [on the Gustav Line].\"<ref name=\"LC69\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=69}}</ref> However, his written orders to Lucas did not really reflect this. Initially Lucas had received orders to \"1. Seize and secure a [[beachhead]] in the vicinity of Anzio 2. Advance and secure Colli Laziali [the Alban Hills] 3. Be prepared to advance on Rome\".<ref name=\"LC69\"/> However, Clark's final orders stated \"...{{nbsp}}2. Advance on Colli Laziali\"<ref name=\"LC77\"/> giving Lucas considerable flexibility as to the timing of any advance on the Alban Hills. It is likely that the caution displayed by both Clark and Lucas was to some extent a product of Clark's experiences at the tough battle for the Salerno beach head<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=85}}</ref> and Lucas' natural caution stemming from his lack of experience in battle.\n\nNeither Clark nor Lucas had full confidence in either their superiors or the operational plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Along with most of the Fifth Army staff they felt that ''Shingle'' was properly a two corps or even a full army task.<ref name=\"LC76\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=76}}</ref> A few days prior to the attack, Lucas wrote in his diary, \"They will end up putting me ashore with inadequate forces and get me in a serious jam... Then, who will get the blame?\"<ref name=\"LC77\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=77}}</ref> and \"[The operation] has a strong odour of [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and apparently the same amateur was still on the coach's bench.\"<ref name=\"LC76\"/> The \"amateur\" can only have referred to Winston Churchill, architect of the disastrous Gallipoli landings of World War I and personal advocate of ''Shingle''.\n\n===Availability of naval forces===\nOne of the problems with the plan was the availability of [[landing ship]]s. The American commanders in particular were determined that nothing should delay the Normandy invasion and the supporting [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]]. Operation Shingle would require the use of landing ships necessary for these operations. Initially ''Shingle'' was to release these assets by January&nbsp;15. However, this being deemed problematic, President Roosevelt granted permission for the craft to remain until February&nbsp;5.\n\nOnly enough [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank landing ships]] (LSTs) to land a single division were initially available to ''Shingle''. Later, at Churchill's personal insistence, enough were made available to land two divisions. Allied intelligence thought that five or six German divisions were in the area, although U.S. 5th Army intelligence severely underestimated the German 10th Army's fighting capacity at the time, believing many of their units would be worn out after the defensive battles fought since September.\n\n===Order of battle===\n{{Further|Anzio order of battle}}\n\n'''Task Force 81''' \n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 140\n | header    = Allied naval commanders for Operation Shingle\n | image1    = Frank_J._Lowry.jpg\n | caption1  = Rear Adm.

However, these plans were scrapped on 20 January, apparently because of the high losses during the airborne assaults at Sicily. The 504th PIR was then assigned to land by sea.</ref>\n\n=== Southern attack ===\n{{Main|Battle of Monte Cassino}}\nThe Fifth Army's attack on the Gustav Line began on January 16, 1944, at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The operation failed to break through, but it partly succeeded in its primary objective. Heinrich von Vietinghoff, commanding the Gustav Line, called for reinforcements, and Kesselring transferred the [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th]] and [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Panzergrenadier Divisions]] from Rome.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n==={{anchor|Operation Shingle}} Initial landings===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Operation Shingle]] -->\n[[Image:Cassino+Anzio1943JanFeb.jpg|thumb|Force dispositions at Anzio and Cassino January / February 1944]]\nThe landings began on January 22, 1944.\n\nAlthough resistance had been expected, as seen at [[Operation Avalanche (World War II)#Salerno landings|Salerno]] during 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, with the exception of desultory ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' strafing runs.\n\nBy midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches. Thirteen Allied troops were killed, and 97&nbsp;wounded; about 200 Germans had been taken as [[POWs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Laurie|1994|p=9}}</ref> The 1st Division penetrated {{convert|2|miles|sigfig=1}} inland, the Rangers captured Anzio's port, the 509th PIB captured Nettuno, and the 3rd Division penetrated {{convert|3|miles|sigfig=1}} inland.\n\nIn the first days of operations, the command of the [[Italian resistance movement]] had a meeting with the Allied General Headquarters: it offered to guide the Allied Force through the [[Alban Hills]] territory, but the Allied Command refused the proposal.\n\n=== After the landings ===\nIt is clear that Lucas' superiors expected some kind of offensive action from him. The point of the landing was to turn the German defences on the Winter Line, taking advantage of their exposed rear and hopefully panicking them into retreating northwards past Rome. However, Lucas instead poured more men and material into his tiny bridgehead, and strengthened his defences.\n\nWinston Churchill was clearly displeased with this action. He said: \"I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore, but all we got was a stranded whale\".<ref>{{harvnb|Colville|2004|p=456}}</ref>\n\nLucas' decision remains a controversial one. Noted military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote, \"Had Lucas risked rushing at Rome the first day, his spearheads would probably have arrived, though they would have soon been crushed. Nevertheless he might have 'staked out claims well inland.'<ref>John Keegan, ''The Second World War', Penguin Books; Reprint edition 2005, {{ISBN|978-0143035732}}, p. 357</ref> \"However, Lucas did not have confidence in the strategic planning of the operation. Also, he could certainly argue that his interpretation of his orders from Clark was not an unreasonable one. With two divisions landed, and facing two or three times that many Germans, it would have been reasonable for Lucas to consider the beachhead insecure. But according to Keegan, Lucas's actions \"achieved the worst of both worlds, exposing his forces to risk without imposing any on the enemy.\"\n\n=== Response of Axis forces ===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16897, Italien, Nettuno, britische Kriegsgefangene, Verwundete.jpg|thumb|220px|British POWs near Nettuno]]\nKesselring was informed of the landings at 3 a.m. January 22. Although the landings came as a surprise, Kesselring had made contingency plans to deal with possible landings at all the likely locations. All the plans relied on his divisions each having previously organised a motorized rapid reaction unit (''Kampfgruppe'') which could move speedily to meet the threat and buy time for the rest of the defenses to get in place.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=83}}</ref> At 5 a.m. he initiated Operation \"Richard\" and ordered the ''Kampfgruppe'' of [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]] and the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division]] to defend the roads leading from Anzio to the [[Alban Hills]] via [[Aprilia, Lazio|Campoleone]] and [[Battle of Cisterna|Cisterna]] whilst his plans expected some 20,000 defending troops to have arrived by the end of the first day. In addition, he requested that [[OKW]] send reinforcements, and in response to this they ordered the equivalent of more than three divisions from France, [[Yugoslavia]], and Germany whilst at the same time releasing to Kesselring a further three divisions in Italy which had been under OKW's direct command.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=101}}</ref> Later that morning, he ordered General [[Eberhard von Mackensen]] ([[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourteenth Army]]) and General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]] ([[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|Tenth Army]] \u2013 Gustav Line) to send him additional reinforcements.\n\nThe German units in the immediate vicinity had in fact been dispatched to reinforce the Gustav Line only a few days earlier. All available reserves from the southern front or on their way to it were rushed toward Anzio and Nettuno; these included the [[3rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzer Grenadier]] and [[71st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|71st Infantry Divisions]], and the bulk of the Luftwaffe's Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division. Kesselring initially considered that a successful defence could not be made if the Allies launched a major attack on January&nbsp;23 or January&nbsp;24. However, by the end of January&nbsp;22, the lack of aggressive action convinced him that a defence could be made. Nevertheless, few additional defenders arrived on January&nbsp;23, although the arrival on the evening of January&nbsp;22 of Lieutenant General [[Alfred Schlemm]] and his 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps headquarters brought greater organisation and purpose to the German defensive preparations. By January&nbsp;24, however, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=123}}</ref>\n\nThree days after the landings, the beachhead was surrounded by a defence line consisting of three divisions: The 4th Parachute Division to the west, the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division to the center in front of Alban Hills, the Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division to the east.\n\nVon Mackensen's 14th Army assumed overall control of the defence on January&nbsp;25. Elements of eight German divisions were employed in the defence line around the beachhead, and five more divisions were on their way to the Anzio area. Kesselring ordered an attack on the beachhead for January&nbsp;28, though it was postponed to February&nbsp;1.\n\n=== Liberty ship involvement===\n[[Liberty ship]]s, which were never intended as warships, were involved in some fighting during the battle of Anzio.

It endured a prolonged barrage of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and bombs.

Due to faulty intelligence, when daylight arrived they were engaged and cut off. A brutal battle with elements of the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]] division followed. Rangers began surrendering individually or in small groups prompting others, acting on their own authority, to shoot them.

Some hours after the attack started the coherence of the front line had been completely shattered, and the fighting for the salient had given way to small unit actions, swaying back and forth through the gullies. In the morning of February&nbsp;4 the situation was becoming more serious, with the 1st Battalion, [[Irish Guards]] (of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]]), only having one cohesive [[Company (military unit)|rifle company]] left and on the opposite side of the salient, the 6th Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] (of [[2nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Brigade]]) was beginning to crumble and later lost three complete companies as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]].<ref>D'Este, p. 200.</ref>\n\nEven though the base of the salient was nearly broken, Lucas was able to bolster the British 1st Division's defenses with the newly arrived [[168th (2nd London) Brigade|168th Brigade]] (from the 56th Division, containing 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]], 1st Battalion, [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]], 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]]).<ref name=\"LLoyd162\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=162}}</ref> The [[3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Brigade]] had been tasked with holding the tip of the salient 2 miles long and 1,000 yards wide on the road going north of Campoleone, but after the German attacks in the early hours of 4 February, the 2nd Battalion, [[Sherwood Foresters]], 1st Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] and 1st Battalion, [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] (all of 3rd Brigade) had been cut off and were surrounded in the pocket.

In anticipation of the following spring, Kesselring ordered the preparation of a new defence line, the [[Caesar C line]], behind the line of beachhead running from the mouth of the river [[Tiber]] just south of Rome through [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], skirting south of the Alban Hills to [[Valmontone]] and across Italy to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast at [[Pescara]], behind which 14th Army and, to their left, 10th Army might withdraw when the need arose.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=219\u2013220}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lucian Truscott]], who had been promoted from the command of U.S. 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Division to replace Lucas as commander of VI&nbsp;Corps on February&nbsp;22, worked with his staff on the plans for a decisive attack as part of a general offensive which Alexander was planning for May and which would include a major offensive on the Gustav Line, [[Operation Diadem]]. The objective of the plan was to fully engage Kesselring's armies with a major offensive and remove any prospect of the Germans withdrawing forces from Italy to redeploy elsewhere. It was also intended to trap the bulk of the German 10th Army between the Allied forces advancing through the Gustav Line and VI&nbsp;Corps thrusting inland from Anzio.\n\nIn March, the 2nd Italian SS \"Vendetta\" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Anglo-American forces at the Anzio beachhead. Dispersed among German battalions, the German commanding officers later gave the Italians companies favourable reports. Members of former Blackshirt Lieutenant-Colonel Degli Oddi's \"Vendetta\" helped defeat a determined effort by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division to overrun their positions and captured a number of prisoners.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Their  performance at Anzio led to designation as units of the Waffen-SS, with all the duties and rights that that entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|Stephen|2004|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe next few weeks saw many changes in divisions on both sides. The [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], which had fought with distinction but suffered heavy losses, was withdrawn to England on 23 March 1944. Also in March the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Division]] and in early May, [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 36th Infantry Division]], had arrived at Anzio. On the British side the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]] of [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]] was replaced in the first week of March by [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry Brigade]] (from [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|British 1st Armoured Division]] in North Africa). The Guards Brigade had suffered devastating casualties (nearly 2,000 of an initial strength of over 2,500) in just less than two months at Anzio.<ref name=\"Blaxland, p. 48\"/> In late March the [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]] had also been relieved, after sustaining very heavy losses (one of its battalions \u2014 7th [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Ox and Bucks]] of [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (London) Brigade]] \u2014 had been reduced from 1,000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/33/a3603133.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 WW2 People's War \u2013 Oxs and Bucks at Anzio|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> to 60), by [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]]. By late May, there were some 150,000 Allied troops in the bridgehead,<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=281}}</ref> including five U.S. and two British divisions, facing five German divisions. The Germans were well dug into prepared defenses, but were weak in numbers of officers and NCOs and, by the time of the late May offensive, lacked any reserves (which had all been sent south to the Gustav fighting).<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=271}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:AnzioCassino1944May.jpg|thumb|The Allied breakout from Anzio and advance from the Gustav Line May 1944.]]\n\nDespite Alexander's overall plan for ''Diadem'' requiring VI Corps to strike inland and cut Route&nbsp;6, Clark asked Truscott to prepare alternatives and to be ready to switch from one to another at 48&nbsp;hours' notice. Of the four scenarios prepared by Truscott, Operation Buffalo called for an attack through Cisterna, into the gap in the hills and to cut Route&nbsp;6 at Valmontone. Operation Turtle on the other hand foresaw a main thrust to the left of the Alban Hills taking Campoleone, Albano and on to Rome. On May&nbsp;5, Alexander selected ''Buffalo'' and issued Clark with orders to this effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=271\u2013272}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Clark was determined that VI Corps should strike directly for Rome as evidenced in his later writing: \"We not only wanted the honor of capturing Rome, but felt that we deserved it... Not only did we intend to become the first army to seize Rome from the south, but we intended to see that people at home knew that it was the Fifth Army that did the job, and knew the price that had been paid for it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=272}}</ref> He argued to Alexander that VI&nbsp;Corps did not have the strength to trap the German 10th Army and Alexander, instead of making his requirements clear, was conciliatory and gave the impression that a push on Rome was still a possibility if ''Buffalo'' ran into difficulties.<ref name=\"LC273\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=273}}</ref> On May&nbsp;6, Clark informed Truscott that \"..the capture of Rome is the only important objective and to be ready to execute ''Turtle'' as well as ''Buffalo''\".<ref name=\"LC273\"/>\n\nTruscott's planning for ''Buffalo'' was meticulous: British 5th Division and 1st Division on the left were to attack along the coast and up the Via Anziate to pin the German 4th Parachute, 65th Infantry and 3rd Panzergrenadier in place whilst the U.S. 45th Infantry, 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions would launch the main assault, engaging the German 362nd and 715th Infantry Divisions and striking towards Campoleone, [[Velletri]] and Cisterna respectively.

By the end of May&nbsp;25, 3rd&nbsp;Infantry were heading into the Velletri gap near [[Cori, Lazio|Cori]], and elements of 1st Armored had reached within {{convert|3|mi}} of Valmontone and were in contact with units of the Herman G\u00f6ring Division which were just starting to arrive from Leghorn.<ref name=\"Leghorn\" group=nb/> Although VI&nbsp;Corps had suffered over 3,300 casualties in the three days fighting, Operation Buffalo was going to plan, and Truscott was confident that a concerted attack by 1st&nbsp;Armored and 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Divisions the next day would get his troops astride Route&nbsp;6.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=300}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anzio1944May-June.jpg|thumb|The final move on Rome]]\nOn the evening of May 25, Truscott received new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route&nbsp;6 would continue, 1st&nbsp;Armored were to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving 3rd&nbsp;Division to continue towards [[Valmontone]] with 1st Special Service Force in support.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=301}}</ref> Clark informed Alexander of these developments late in the morning of May&nbsp;26 by which time the change of orders was a ''fait accompli''.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=302}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later\n\n<blockquote>...I was dumbfounded. This was no time to drive to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to insure the destruction of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... [However] he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957|p= 256}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe went on to write\n\n<blockquote>There has never been any doubt in my mind that had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander's instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May&nbsp;26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full. To be first in Rome was a poor compensation for this lost opportunity.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957| p=259}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn May 26, while the VI Corps was initiating its difficult maneuver, Kesselring threw elements of four divisions into the Velletri gap to stall the advance on Route&nbsp;6. For four days they slugged it out against 3rd Division until finally withdrawing on May&nbsp;30, having kept Route&nbsp;6 open and allowed seven divisions from 10th&nbsp;Army to withdraw and head north of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=304}}</ref>\n\nOn the new axis of attack little progress was made until 1st Armored were in position on May&nbsp;29, when the front advanced to the main Caesar C Line defences. Nevertheless, an early breakthrough seemed unlikely until on May&nbsp;30 Major General [[Fred L. Walker]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]] found a gap in the Caesar Line at the join between 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps and LXXVI&nbsp;Panzer Corps. Climbing the steep slopes of Monte Artemisio they threatened Velletri from the rear and obliged the defenders to withdraw. This was a key turning point, and von&nbsp;Mackensen offered his resignation which Kesselring accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=307}}</ref>\n\nRaising the pressure further, Clark assigned [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]] which, fighting its way along the coast from the Gustav Line, had joined up with VI&nbsp;Corps on May&nbsp;25 to attack around the right hand side of the Alban Hills and advance along the line of Route&nbsp;6 to Rome.\n\nOn June 2 the Caesar Line collapsed under the mounting pressure, and 14th Army commenced a fighting withdrawal through Rome. On the same day Hitler, fearing another Stalingrad, had ordered Kesslering that there should be \"no defence of Rome\".<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=311}}</ref> Over the next day, the rearguards were gradually overwhelmed, and Rome was entered in the early hours of June&nbsp;4 with Clark holding an impromptu press conference on the steps of the Town Hall on the [[Capitoline Hill]] that morning. He ensured the event was a strictly American affair by stationing military police at road junctions to refuse entry to the city by British military personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=309\u2013319}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA11058.jpg|thumb|British soldier guards a group of German prisoners at Anzio, 22 January 1944]]\nAlthough controversy continues regarding what might have happened if Lucas had been more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, had the strength to achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.\n\nVolume 5 of Churchill's ''The Second World War'' is riddled with implied criticism of Lucas, blaming the failure on his caution. After the war, Kesselring gave his evaluation:\n\n{{quote|It would have been the Anglo-American doom to overextend themselves.

He had clearly made great political efforts to procure certain resources, especially the extra [[Landing Ship, Tank|LSTs]] needed to deliver a second division to shore, but also specific units useful to the attack such as with the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]]. He argued that even regardless of the tactical outcome of the operation, there was immediate strategic benefit with regard to the wider war. After the landings, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] dropped its plans to transfer five of Kesselring's best divisions to [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwestern Europe]]. That obviously benefited the upcoming [[Operation Overlord]]. Churchill also had to ensure the British-dominated forces in Italy were contributing to the war at a time when the Soviet [[Red Army]] were suffering tremendous losses on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nBecause of Clark's change of plan, [[Operation Diadem]] (during which the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] sustained 44,000 casualties) failed in its objective of destroying the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]]. It also condemned the Allies to another year of bloody combat in Italy, notably around the [[Gothic Line]] from August 1944 through March 1945.\n\nThe greatest loss was that if the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. Army VI Corps]] main effort had continued on the [[Valmontone]] axis from May 26, Clark could probably have reached Rome more quickly than by the route northwest from Cisterna. The VI Corps could also have cut Highway 6 and then put much more pressure on the 10th Army than it actually did.<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|2000|p=363}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Whicker]] who as a war correspondent with the British Army's Film and Photo Unit, and who was present during the fighting, later said:\n\n{{quote|After breaking out of Anzio, Alexander's plan was for the Fifth Army to drive east to cut Kesselring's escape route to the north and trap much of his Tenth and Fourteenth Armies. The operation started well, but then suddenly, when leading troops were only six kilometers from closing their trap at [[Frosinone]], the Fifth Army was re-directed and sent north towards Rome. The trap was left open. General Mark Clark was so eager that the world should see pictures showing him as the liberator of Rome, that he allowed the armies of a delighted Kesselring to escape.\n\nHe had ignored the orders of Field Marshall Alexander in a decision as militarily stupid as it was insubordinate.\n\nThis, vain-glorious blunder, the worst of the entire war, lost us a stunning victory, lengthened the war by many months and earned Mark Clark the contempt of other American and British generals. They saw an operation that could have won the war in Italy, thrown away at the cost of many Allied lives, because of the obsession and vanity of one man.\n\nIf General Mark Clark had been in the German Army, Hitler would have had him shot.|Alan Whicker<ref>''Whicker's War'' Part Two \"The Survivor\", Insight Television, 2004.</ref>}}\n\n==Notable participants==\n* [[Brigadier General]] (Lieutenant colonel at the time) [[Felix L.

The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]].<ref>At the time joined in a single ''[[comune]]'' called [[Nettunia]].

Lucas]], of the [[U.S. Army]], commanding [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]] with the intention being to outflank German forces at the [[Winter Line]] and enable an attack on [[Rome]].\n\nThe success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed [[marshland]] and surrounded by mountains, depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], commander of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], understood that risk, but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate, {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Lucas, who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack. The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome. However, Lucas, who had little confidence in the operation as planned, failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength.\n\nWhile Lucas consolidated, Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]], the German commander in the Italian theatre, moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the [[beachhead]]. His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position. The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water, planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by [[epidemic]]. For weeks a rain of shells fell on the beach, the marsh, the harbour, and on anything else observable from the hills, with little distinction between forward and rear positions.\n\nAfter a month of heavy but inconclusive fighting, Lucas was relieved and sent home. His replacement was Major General [[Lucian Truscott]], who had previously commanded the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. The Allies broke out in May. But, instead of striking inland to cut lines of communication of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Tenth Army]]'s units [[Battle of Monte Cassino|fighting at Monte Cassino]], Truscott, on Clark's orders, reluctantly turned his forces north-west towards Rome, which was captured on June 4, 1944. As a result, the forces of the German Tenth Army fighting at Cassino were able to withdraw and rejoin the rest of Kesselring's forces north of Rome, regroup, and make a fighting withdrawal to his next major prepared defensive position on the [[Gothic Line]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\nAt the end of 1943, following the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], Allied forces were bogged down at the [[Gustav Line]], a defensive line across Italy south of the strategic objective of Rome. The [[Geography of Italy|terrain of central Italy]] had proved ideally suited to defense, and Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] took full advantage.\n\nOperation Shingle was originally conceived by British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in December 1943, as he lay recovering from [[pneumonia]] in [[Marrakesh]]. His concept was to land two divisions at Anzio, bypassing German forces in central Italy, and take Rome, the strategic objective of the current Battle of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=321}}</ref> By January he had recovered and was badgering his commanders for a plan of attack, accusing them of not wanting to fight but of being interested only in drawing pay and eating rations.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=322}}</ref> General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], had already considered such a plan since October using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have the troops nor the means to transport them. Clark proposed landing a reinforced division to divert German troops from [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. This second landing, however, instead of failing similarly{{clarify|date=April 2018}}, would hold <ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Anzio|url=http://www.worldwar2facts.org/battle-of-anzio.html|work=World War II Facts|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> \"the shingle\" for a week in expectation of a breakthrough at Cassino, and so the operation was named Shingle.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=323}}</ref>\n\nThe Anzio beachhead is at the northwestern end of a tract of reclaimed marshland, formerly the [[Pontine Marshes]], now the Pontine Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying [[malaria]], in Roman times armies marched as quickly as possible across it on the military road, the [[Via Appia]]. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and on others by mountains: the Monti Albani, the [[Monti Lepini]], the [[Monti Ausoni]] and further south the [[Monti Aurunci]] (where the allies had been brought to a halt before [[Monte Cassino]]). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of [[Lazio]], the ancient [[Latium]]. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the [[Via Latina]], running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, risking entrapment. The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under [[Benito Mussolini]]. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from north Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.\n\nWhen [[Lucian Truscott]]'s [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Division]] was first selected for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap and there would be no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. Apparently the two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. [[Allied Forces Headquarters|Mediterranean Theatre]] commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], leaving to take command of [[Operation Overlord]], left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=324}}</ref> \n\nThe final plan called for Lucas to lead the US [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] in a landing in the Anzio area, followed by an advance into the [[Alban Hills]], to cut German communications and \"threaten the rear of the German XIV [[Panzer Corps]]\"{{cn|date=October 2019}} (under [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]]). It was hoped that such an advance would draw German forces away from the Monte Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough there.\n\n==Plan==\nPlanners argued that if Kesselring (in charge of German forces in Italy) pulled troops out of the [[Gustav Line]] to defend against the Allied assault, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line; if Kesselring didn't pull troops out of the Gustav Line, then Operation Shingle would threaten to capture Rome and cut off the German units defending the Gustav Line. Should Germany have adequate reinforcements available to defend both Rome and the Gustav Line, the Allies felt that the operation would nevertheless be useful in engaging forces which could otherwise be committed on another front. The operation was officially canceled on December 18, 1943. However, it was later reselected.\n\nClark did not feel he had the numbers on the southern front to exploit any breakthrough. His plan therefore was relying on the southern offensive drawing Kesselring's reserves in and providing the Anzio force the opportunity to break inland quickly. This would also reflect the orders he had received from Alexander to \"...{{nbsp}}carry out an assault landing on the beaches in the vicinity of Rome with the object of cutting the enemy lines of communication and threatening the rear of the German XIV&nbsp;Corps [on the Gustav Line].\"<ref name=\"LC69\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=69}}</ref> However, his written orders to Lucas did not really reflect this. Initially Lucas had received orders to \"1. Seize and secure a [[beachhead]] in the vicinity of Anzio 2. Advance and secure Colli Laziali [the Alban Hills] 3. Be prepared to advance on Rome\".<ref name=\"LC69\"/> However, Clark's final orders stated \"...{{nbsp}}2. Advance on Colli Laziali\"<ref name=\"LC77\"/> giving Lucas considerable flexibility as to the timing of any advance on the Alban Hills. It is likely that the caution displayed by both Clark and Lucas was to some extent a product of Clark's experiences at the tough battle for the Salerno beach head<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=85}}</ref> and Lucas' natural caution stemming from his lack of experience in battle.\n\nNeither Clark nor Lucas had full confidence in either their superiors or the operational plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Along with most of the Fifth Army staff they felt that ''Shingle'' was properly a two corps or even a full army task.<ref name=\"LC76\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=76}}</ref> A few days prior to the attack, Lucas wrote in his diary, \"They will end up putting me ashore with inadequate forces and get me in a serious jam... Then, who will get the blame?\"<ref name=\"LC77\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=77}}</ref> and \"[The operation] has a strong odour of [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and apparently the same amateur was still on the coach's bench.\"<ref name=\"LC76\"/> The \"amateur\" can only have referred to Winston Churchill, architect of the disastrous Gallipoli landings of World War I and personal advocate of ''Shingle''.\n\n===Availability of naval forces===\nOne of the problems with the plan was the availability of [[landing ship]]s. The American commanders in particular were determined that nothing should delay the Normandy invasion and the supporting [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]]. Operation Shingle would require the use of landing ships necessary for these operations. Initially ''Shingle'' was to release these assets by January&nbsp;15. However, this being deemed problematic, President Roosevelt granted permission for the craft to remain until February&nbsp;5.\n\nOnly enough [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank landing ships]] (LSTs) to land a single division were initially available to ''Shingle''. Later, at Churchill's personal insistence, enough were made available to land two divisions. Allied intelligence thought that five or six German divisions were in the area, although U.S. 5th Army intelligence severely underestimated the German 10th Army's fighting capacity at the time, believing many of their units would be worn out after the defensive battles fought since September.\n\n===Order of battle===\n{{Further|Anzio order of battle}}\n\n'''Task Force 81''' \n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 140\n | header    = Allied naval commanders for Operation Shingle\n | image1    = Frank_J._Lowry.jpg\n | caption1  = Rear Adm.

However, these plans were scrapped on 20 January, apparently because of the high losses during the airborne assaults at Sicily. The 504th PIR was then assigned to land by sea.</ref>\n\n=== Southern attack ===\n{{Main|Battle of Monte Cassino}}\nThe Fifth Army's attack on the Gustav Line began on January 16, 1944, at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The operation failed to break through, but it partly succeeded in its primary objective. Heinrich von Vietinghoff, commanding the Gustav Line, called for reinforcements, and Kesselring transferred the [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th]] and [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Panzergrenadier Divisions]] from Rome.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n==={{anchor|Operation Shingle}} Initial landings===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Operation Shingle]] -->\n[[Image:Cassino+Anzio1943JanFeb.jpg|thumb|Force dispositions at Anzio and Cassino January / February 1944]]\nThe landings began on January 22, 1944.\n\nAlthough resistance had been expected, as seen at [[Operation Avalanche (World War II)#Salerno landings|Salerno]] during 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, with the exception of desultory ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' strafing runs.\n\nBy midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches. Thirteen Allied troops were killed, and 97&nbsp;wounded; about 200 Germans had been taken as [[POWs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Laurie|1994|p=9}}</ref> The 1st Division penetrated {{convert|2|miles|sigfig=1}} inland, the Rangers captured Anzio's port, the 509th PIB captured Nettuno, and the 3rd Division penetrated {{convert|3|miles|sigfig=1}} inland.\n\nIn the first days of operations, the command of the [[Italian resistance movement]] had a meeting with the Allied General Headquarters: it offered to guide the Allied Force through the [[Alban Hills]] territory, but the Allied Command refused the proposal.\n\n=== After the landings ===\nIt is clear that Lucas' superiors expected some kind of offensive action from him. The point of the landing was to turn the German defences on the Winter Line, taking advantage of their exposed rear and hopefully panicking them into retreating northwards past Rome. However, Lucas instead poured more men and material into his tiny bridgehead, and strengthened his defences.\n\nWinston Churchill was clearly displeased with this action. He said: \"I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore, but all we got was a stranded whale\".<ref>{{harvnb|Colville|2004|p=456}}</ref>\n\nLucas' decision remains a controversial one. Noted military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote, \"Had Lucas risked rushing at Rome the first day, his spearheads would probably have arrived, though they would have soon been crushed. Nevertheless he might have 'staked out claims well inland.'<ref>John Keegan, ''The Second World War', Penguin Books; Reprint edition 2005, {{ISBN|978-0143035732}}, p. 357</ref> \"However, Lucas did not have confidence in the strategic planning of the operation. Also, he could certainly argue that his interpretation of his orders from Clark was not an unreasonable one. With two divisions landed, and facing two or three times that many Germans, it would have been reasonable for Lucas to consider the beachhead insecure. But according to Keegan, Lucas's actions \"achieved the worst of both worlds, exposing his forces to risk without imposing any on the enemy.\"\n\n=== Response of Axis forces ===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16897, Italien, Nettuno, britische Kriegsgefangene, Verwundete.jpg|thumb|220px|British POWs near Nettuno]]\nKesselring was informed of the landings at 3 a.m. January 22. Although the landings came as a surprise, Kesselring had made contingency plans to deal with possible landings at all the likely locations. All the plans relied on his divisions each having previously organised a motorized rapid reaction unit (''Kampfgruppe'') which could move speedily to meet the threat and buy time for the rest of the defenses to get in place.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=83}}</ref> At 5 a.m. he initiated Operation \"Richard\" and ordered the ''Kampfgruppe'' of [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]] and the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division]] to defend the roads leading from Anzio to the [[Alban Hills]] via [[Aprilia, Lazio|Campoleone]] and [[Battle of Cisterna|Cisterna]] whilst his plans expected some 20,000 defending troops to have arrived by the end of the first day. In addition, he requested that [[OKW]] send reinforcements, and in response to this they ordered the equivalent of more than three divisions from France, [[Yugoslavia]], and Germany whilst at the same time releasing to Kesselring a further three divisions in Italy which had been under OKW's direct command.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=101}}</ref> Later that morning, he ordered General [[Eberhard von Mackensen]] ([[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourteenth Army]]) and General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]] ([[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|Tenth Army]] \u2013 Gustav Line) to send him additional reinforcements.\n\nThe German units in the immediate vicinity had in fact been dispatched to reinforce the Gustav Line only a few days earlier. All available reserves from the southern front or on their way to it were rushed toward Anzio and Nettuno; these included the [[3rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzer Grenadier]] and [[71st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|71st Infantry Divisions]], and the bulk of the Luftwaffe's Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division. Kesselring initially considered that a successful defence could not be made if the Allies launched a major attack on January&nbsp;23 or January&nbsp;24. However, by the end of January&nbsp;22, the lack of aggressive action convinced him that a defence could be made. Nevertheless, few additional defenders arrived on January&nbsp;23, although the arrival on the evening of January&nbsp;22 of Lieutenant General [[Alfred Schlemm]] and his 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps headquarters brought greater organisation and purpose to the German defensive preparations. By January&nbsp;24, however, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=123}}</ref>\n\nThree days after the landings, the beachhead was surrounded by a defence line consisting of three divisions: The 4th Parachute Division to the west, the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division to the center in front of Alban Hills, the Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division to the east.\n\nVon Mackensen's 14th Army assumed overall control of the defence on January&nbsp;25. Elements of eight German divisions were employed in the defence line around the beachhead, and five more divisions were on their way to the Anzio area. Kesselring ordered an attack on the beachhead for January&nbsp;28, though it was postponed to February&nbsp;1.\n\n=== Liberty ship involvement===\n[[Liberty ship]]s, which were never intended as warships, were involved in some fighting during the battle of Anzio. On 22 to 30 January 1944 the {{SS|Lawton B. Evans}} was under repeated bombardment from shore batteries and aircraft throughout an eight-day period. It endured a prolonged barrage of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and bombs. The gun crew fought back with shellfire and shot down five German planes.<ref>{{citation|title=[[:commons:File:SS_Lawton_B._Evans_Commendation.pdf|Pers-68-MH MM/822 62 83]]|date=1944-06-24 |publisher=[[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] |work=commons.wikimedia.org }}</ref>\n\n=== Allied offensive ===\n[[Image:Anzio1944-02-01.jpg|thumb|Allied force dispositions on 1 February 1944]]\nFurther troop movements including the arrival of [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 45th Infantry Division]] and [[1st Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Armored Division]], brought Allied forces total on the beachhead to 69,000&nbsp;men, 508&nbsp;guns and 208&nbsp;tanks by January&nbsp;29, whilst the total defending Germans had risen to 71,500.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=134}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=136}}</ref> Lucas initiated a two-pronged attack on January&nbsp;30.

On the right, ahead of the main assault, two Ranger battalions made a daring covert advance towards Cisterna (see [[Battle of Cisterna]]). Due to faulty intelligence, when daylight arrived they were engaged and cut off. A brutal battle with elements of the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]] division followed. Rangers began surrendering individually or in small groups prompting others, acting on their own authority, to shoot them. Of the 767&nbsp;men in the 1st and 3rd&nbsp;Ranger Battalions, 6 returned to the Allied lines and 761 were killed or captured.<ref>{{harvnb|King|1985|loc=Ch 4}}</ref>\n\n===German counterattacks===\nBy early February, German forces in Fourteenth Army numbered some 100,000 troops organised into two Army Corps, the 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps under Schlemm and the [[LXXVI&nbsp;Panzer Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Traugott Herr]]. Allied forces by this time totalled 76,400 (including the recently arrived [[56th (London) Infantry Division|British 56th Infantry Division]], under Major-General [[Gerald Templer]], which arrived complete on February 16).<ref name=\"LLoyd158\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=158}}</ref> After making exploratory probes on the Campoleone salient on the afternoon of February&nbsp;3 the German forces launched a full counterattack at 23:00<ref name=\"LLoyd160\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=160}}</ref> in order to reduce the salient and \"iron out\" the front line.<ref name=\"LLoyd158\"/> Von&nbsp;Mackensen had planned for the salient to be ground away rather than employing a rapid, focused thrust to cut it off. Some hours after the attack started the coherence of the front line had been completely shattered, and the fighting for the salient had given way to small unit actions, swaying back and forth through the gullies. In the morning of February&nbsp;4 the situation was becoming more serious, with the 1st Battalion, [[Irish Guards]] (of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]]), only having one cohesive [[Company (military unit)|rifle company]] left and on the opposite side of the salient, the 6th Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] (of [[2nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Brigade]]) was beginning to crumble and later lost three complete companies as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]].<ref>D'Este, p. 200.</ref>\n\nEven though the base of the salient was nearly broken, Lucas was able to bolster the British 1st Division's defenses with the newly arrived [[168th (2nd London) Brigade|168th Brigade]] (from the 56th Division, containing 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]], 1st Battalion, [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]], 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]]).<ref name=\"LLoyd162\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=162}}</ref> The [[3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Brigade]] had been tasked with holding the tip of the salient 2 miles long and 1,000 yards wide on the road going north of Campoleone, but after the German attacks in the early hours of 4 February, the 2nd Battalion, [[Sherwood Foresters]], 1st Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] and 1st Battalion, [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] (all of 3rd Brigade) had been cut off and were surrounded in the pocket.

In anticipation of the following spring, Kesselring ordered the preparation of a new defence line, the [[Caesar C line]], behind the line of beachhead running from the mouth of the river [[Tiber]] just south of Rome through [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], skirting south of the Alban Hills to [[Valmontone]] and across Italy to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast at [[Pescara]], behind which 14th Army and, to their left, 10th Army might withdraw when the need arose.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=219\u2013220}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lucian Truscott]], who had been promoted from the command of U.S. 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Division to replace Lucas as commander of VI&nbsp;Corps on February&nbsp;22, worked with his staff on the plans for a decisive attack as part of a general offensive which Alexander was planning for May and which would include a major offensive on the Gustav Line, [[Operation Diadem]]. The objective of the plan was to fully engage Kesselring's armies with a major offensive and remove any prospect of the Germans withdrawing forces from Italy to redeploy elsewhere. It was also intended to trap the bulk of the German 10th Army between the Allied forces advancing through the Gustav Line and VI&nbsp;Corps thrusting inland from Anzio.\n\nIn March, the 2nd Italian SS \"Vendetta\" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Anglo-American forces at the Anzio beachhead. Dispersed among German battalions, the German commanding officers later gave the Italians companies favourable reports. Members of former Blackshirt Lieutenant-Colonel Degli Oddi's \"Vendetta\" helped defeat a determined effort by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division to overrun their positions and captured a number of prisoners.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Their  performance at Anzio led to designation as units of the Waffen-SS, with all the duties and rights that that entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|Stephen|2004|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe next few weeks saw many changes in divisions on both sides. The [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], which had fought with distinction but suffered heavy losses, was withdrawn to England on 23 March 1944. Also in March the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Division]] and in early May, [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 36th Infantry Division]], had arrived at Anzio. On the British side the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]] of [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]] was replaced in the first week of March by [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry Brigade]] (from [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|British 1st Armoured Division]] in North Africa). The Guards Brigade had suffered devastating casualties (nearly 2,000 of an initial strength of over 2,500) in just less than two months at Anzio.<ref name=\"Blaxland, p. 48\"/> In late March the [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]] had also been relieved, after sustaining very heavy losses (one of its battalions \u2014 7th [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Ox and Bucks]] of [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (London) Brigade]] \u2014 had been reduced from 1,000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/33/a3603133.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 WW2 People's War \u2013 Oxs and Bucks at Anzio|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> to 60), by [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]]. By late May, there were some 150,000 Allied troops in the bridgehead,<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=281}}</ref> including five U.S. and two British divisions, facing five German divisions. The Germans were well dug into prepared defenses, but were weak in numbers of officers and NCOs and, by the time of the late May offensive, lacked any reserves (which had all been sent south to the Gustav fighting).<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=271}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:AnzioCassino1944May.jpg|thumb|The Allied breakout from Anzio and advance from the Gustav Line May 1944.]]\n\nDespite Alexander's overall plan for ''Diadem'' requiring VI Corps to strike inland and cut Route&nbsp;6, Clark asked Truscott to prepare alternatives and to be ready to switch from one to another at 48&nbsp;hours' notice. Of the four scenarios prepared by Truscott, Operation Buffalo called for an attack through Cisterna, into the gap in the hills and to cut Route&nbsp;6 at Valmontone. Operation Turtle on the other hand foresaw a main thrust to the left of the Alban Hills taking Campoleone, Albano and on to Rome. On May&nbsp;5, Alexander selected ''Buffalo'' and issued Clark with orders to this effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=271\u2013272}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Clark was determined that VI Corps should strike directly for Rome as evidenced in his later writing: \"We not only wanted the honor of capturing Rome, but felt that we deserved it... Not only did we intend to become the first army to seize Rome from the south, but we intended to see that people at home knew that it was the Fifth Army that did the job, and knew the price that had been paid for it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=272}}</ref> He argued to Alexander that VI&nbsp;Corps did not have the strength to trap the German 10th Army and Alexander, instead of making his requirements clear, was conciliatory and gave the impression that a push on Rome was still a possibility if ''Buffalo'' ran into difficulties.<ref name=\"LC273\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=273}}</ref> On May&nbsp;6, Clark informed Truscott that \"..the capture of Rome is the only important objective and to be ready to execute ''Turtle'' as well as ''Buffalo''\".<ref name=\"LC273\"/>\n\nTruscott's planning for ''Buffalo'' was meticulous: British 5th Division and 1st Division on the left were to attack along the coast and up the Via Anziate to pin the German 4th Parachute, 65th Infantry and 3rd Panzergrenadier in place whilst the U.S. 45th Infantry, 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions would launch the main assault, engaging the German 362nd and 715th Infantry Divisions and striking towards Campoleone, [[Velletri]] and Cisterna respectively.

By the end of May&nbsp;25, 3rd&nbsp;Infantry were heading into the Velletri gap near [[Cori, Lazio|Cori]], and elements of 1st Armored had reached within {{convert|3|mi}} of Valmontone and were in contact with units of the Herman G\u00f6ring Division which were just starting to arrive from Leghorn.<ref name=\"Leghorn\" group=nb/> Although VI&nbsp;Corps had suffered over 3,300 casualties in the three days fighting, Operation Buffalo was going to plan, and Truscott was confident that a concerted attack by 1st&nbsp;Armored and 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Divisions the next day would get his troops astride Route&nbsp;6.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=300}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anzio1944May-June.jpg|thumb|The final move on Rome]]\nOn the evening of May 25, Truscott received new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route&nbsp;6 would continue, 1st&nbsp;Armored were to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving 3rd&nbsp;Division to continue towards [[Valmontone]] with 1st Special Service Force in support.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=301}}</ref> Clark informed Alexander of these developments late in the morning of May&nbsp;26 by which time the change of orders was a ''fait accompli''.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=302}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later\n\n<blockquote>...I was dumbfounded. This was no time to drive to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to insure the destruction of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... [However] he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957|p= 256}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe went on to write\n\n<blockquote>There has never been any doubt in my mind that had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander's instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May&nbsp;26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full. To be first in Rome was a poor compensation for this lost opportunity.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957| p=259}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn May 26, while the VI Corps was initiating its difficult maneuver, Kesselring threw elements of four divisions into the Velletri gap to stall the advance on Route&nbsp;6. For four days they slugged it out against 3rd Division until finally withdrawing on May&nbsp;30, having kept Route&nbsp;6 open and allowed seven divisions from 10th&nbsp;Army to withdraw and head north of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=304}}</ref>\n\nOn the new axis of attack little progress was made until 1st Armored were in position on May&nbsp;29, when the front advanced to the main Caesar C Line defences. Nevertheless, an early breakthrough seemed unlikely until on May&nbsp;30 Major General [[Fred L. Walker]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]] found a gap in the Caesar Line at the join between 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps and LXXVI&nbsp;Panzer Corps. Climbing the steep slopes of Monte Artemisio they threatened Velletri from the rear and obliged the defenders to withdraw. This was a key turning point, and von&nbsp;Mackensen offered his resignation which Kesselring accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=307}}</ref>\n\nRaising the pressure further, Clark assigned [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]] which, fighting its way along the coast from the Gustav Line, had joined up with VI&nbsp;Corps on May&nbsp;25 to attack around the right hand side of the Alban Hills and advance along the line of Route&nbsp;6 to Rome.\n\nOn June 2 the Caesar Line collapsed under the mounting pressure, and 14th Army commenced a fighting withdrawal through Rome. On the same day Hitler, fearing another Stalingrad, had ordered Kesslering that there should be \"no defence of Rome\".<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=311}}</ref> Over the next day, the rearguards were gradually overwhelmed, and Rome was entered in the early hours of June&nbsp;4 with Clark holding an impromptu press conference on the steps of the Town Hall on the [[Capitoline Hill]] that morning. He ensured the event was a strictly American affair by stationing military police at road junctions to refuse entry to the city by British military personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=309\u2013319}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA11058.jpg|thumb|British soldier guards a group of German prisoners at Anzio, 22 January 1944]]\nAlthough controversy continues regarding what might have happened if Lucas had been more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, had the strength to achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.\n\nVolume 5 of Churchill's ''The Second World War'' is riddled with implied criticism of Lucas, blaming the failure on his caution. After the war, Kesselring gave his evaluation:\n\n{{quote|It would have been the Anglo-American doom to overextend themselves. The landing force was initially weak, only a division or so of infantry, and without armour. It was a halfway measure of an offensive; that was your basic error.<ref Name=\"Lloyd325\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=325}}</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, Field Marshal Sir [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], in his Official Dispatch, stated, \"The actual course of events was probably the most advantageous in the end.\"<ref Name=\"Lloyd325\"/>\n\nChurchill defended the operation<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1985|p=436}}</ref> and believed that sufficient forces were available. He had clearly made great political efforts to procure certain resources, especially the extra [[Landing Ship, Tank|LSTs]] needed to deliver a second division to shore, but also specific units useful to the attack such as with the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]]. He argued that even regardless of the tactical outcome of the operation, there was immediate strategic benefit with regard to the wider war. After the landings, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] dropped its plans to transfer five of Kesselring's best divisions to [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwestern Europe]]. That obviously benefited the upcoming [[Operation Overlord]]. Churchill also had to ensure the British-dominated forces in Italy were contributing to the war at a time when the Soviet [[Red Army]] were suffering tremendous losses on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nBecause of Clark's change of plan, [[Operation Diadem]] (during which the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] sustained 44,000 casualties) failed in its objective of destroying the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]]. It also condemned the Allies to another year of bloody combat in Italy, notably around the [[Gothic Line]] from August 1944 through March 1945.\n\nThe greatest loss was that if the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. Army VI Corps]] main effort had continued on the [[Valmontone]] axis from May 26, Clark could probably have reached Rome more quickly than by the route northwest from Cisterna. The VI Corps could also have cut Highway 6 and then put much more pressure on the 10th Army than it actually did.<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|2000|p=363}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Whicker]] who as a war correspondent with the British Army's Film and Photo Unit, and who was present during the fighting, later said:\n\n{{quote|After breaking out of Anzio, Alexander's plan was for the Fifth Army to drive east to cut Kesselring's escape route to the north and trap much of his Tenth and Fourteenth Armies. The operation started well, but then suddenly, when leading troops were only six kilometers from closing their trap at [[Frosinone]], the Fifth Army was re-directed and sent north towards Rome. The trap was left open. General Mark Clark was so eager that the world should see pictures showing him as the liberator of Rome, that he allowed the armies of a delighted Kesselring to escape.\n\nHe had ignored the orders of Field Marshall Alexander in a decision as militarily stupid as it was insubordinate.\n\nThis, vain-glorious blunder, the worst of the entire war, lost us a stunning victory, lengthened the war by many months and earned Mark Clark the contempt of other American and British generals. They saw an operation that could have won the war in Italy, thrown away at the cost of many Allied lives, because of the obsession and vanity of one man.\n\nIf General Mark Clark had been in the German Army, Hitler would have had him shot.|Alan Whicker<ref>''Whicker's War'' Part Two \"The Survivor\", Insight Television, 2004.</ref>}}\n\n==Notable participants==\n* [[Brigadier General]] (Lieutenant colonel at the time) [[Felix L.

I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]\". When the [[Single (music)|single]] was originally released in the United Kingdom on 5 October 1962, it peaked at number 17. In 1982 it was re-promoted (not re-issued, retaining the same catalogue number) and reached number four. It was released in the United States in 1964, where it became a number one hit.\n\nThe song was written several years before it was recorded, and prior to the existence of the Beatles. The single features John Lennon's prominent harmonica playing and duet vocals by him and Paul McCartney. Three different recorded versions of the song by the Beatles have been released, each with a different drummer.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Love Me Do\" was primarily written by [[Paul McCartney]] in 1958\u20131959 while [[truant]] from school at age 16.{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=413}} [[John Lennon]] contributed the [[middle eight]] (or \"bridge\").{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=413}}<ref name=\"miles 1997\">Miles (1997).</ref>{{sfn|Beatles Interview Database|2009}} The song was later credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=413}} Lennon said: \"'Love Me Do' is Paul's song ... I do know he had the song around, in Hamburg, even, way, way before we were songwriters.\"<ref name=BB>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/love-me-do/|title=Love Me Do|work=The Beatles Bible}}</ref> McCartney said: \"'Love Me Do' was completely co-written ... It was just Lennon and McCartney sitting down without either of us having a particularly original idea. We loved doing it, it was a very interesting thing to try and learn to do, to become songwriters. I think why we eventually got so strong was we wrote so much through our formative period. 'Love Me Do' was our first hit, which ironically is one of the two songs that we control, because when we first signed to EMI they had a music publishing company called Ardmore and Beechwood which took the two songs, 'Love Me Do' and '[[P.S. I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]', and in doing a deal somewhere along the way we were able to get them back.\"<ref name=BB /><ref>Barry Miles. ''Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now''</ref>\n\nTheir practice at the time was to scribble songs in a school notebook, dreaming of stardom, always writing \"Another Lennon\u2013McCartney Original\" at the top of the page.<ref name=rollingstone /> \"Love Me Do\" is a song based around three simple chords: G7 and C, before moving to D for its middle eight. It begins with Lennon playing a [[blues]]y dry \"dockside harmonica\" riff, {{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p51}} then features Lennon and McCartney on joint lead vocals, including [[Everly Brothers]]-style harmonising during the beseeching \"''please''\" before McCartney sings the unaccompanied vocal line on the song's title phrase.\n\nLennon had previously sung the title sections, but this change in arrangement was made in the studio under the direction of [[Record producer|producer]] [[George Martin]] when he realised that the harmonica part encroached on the vocal (Lennon needed to begin playing the harmonica again on the same beat as the \"do\" of \"love me do\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=59}} However, when a similar situation later occurred on the \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" single session the harmonica was superimposed afterwards using tape-to-tape [[overdubbing]]).{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=23}} Described by Ian MacDonald as \"standing out like a bare brick wall in a suburban sitting-room, 'Love Me Do', [with its] blunt working class northerness, rang the first faint chime of a revolutionary bell\" compared to the standard [[Tin Pan Alley]] productions occupying the charts at the time.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=52\u201353}}\n\n==Recordings and releases==\n\"Love Me Do\" was recorded by the Beatles on three different occasions with three different drummers at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] at 3 Abbey Road in London:\n* EMI Artist Test (The Beatles audition for [[George Martin]]) on 6 June 1962 with [[Pete Best]] on drums.{{Sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=16\u201317}} This version (previously thought to be lost) is available on ''[[Anthology 1]]''.\n* First proper recording session, 4 September 1962. In August, Best had been replaced with [[Ringo Starr]]. Producer George Martin did not approve of Best's drumming for studio work. It was the norm at that time to have a specialist studio drummer who knew the ways of studio work. The decision to fire Best was not Martin's. The Beatles with Starr recorded a version at EMI Studios.{{Sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=18\u201319}} They recorded \"Love Me Do\" in 15 takes. This version with Starr is available on ''[[Past Masters]]''.\n* Second recording session, 11 September 1962. A week later, The Beatles returned to the same studio and they made a recording of \"Love Me Do\" with session drummer [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] on drums. Starr was relegated to playing tambourine. As tambourine is not present on the 4 September recording, this is the easiest way to distinguish between the Starr and White recordings.  The Andy White version is available on ''[[Please Please Me]]''.\n\nFirst issues of the single, released on [[Parlophone]] in the UK on 5 October 1962, featured the Ringo Starr version, prompting [[Mark Lewisohn]] to later write: \"Clearly, the 11 September version was not regarded as having been a significant improvement after all\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|p=22}}\n\nThe Andy White version of the track was included on The Beatles' debut UK album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', ''[[The Beatles' Hits|The Beatles' Hits EP]]'', and subsequent album releases on which \"Love Me Do\" was included (except as noted below), as well as on the first US single release in April 1964. For the 1976 single re-issue and the 1982 \"20th Anniversary\" re-issue, the Andy White version was again used. The Ringo Starr version was included on the albums ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'' (US version), ''[[Past Masters]]'', and ''[[Mono Masters]]''.  It was also included on Record 1 of ''[[The Beatles Box]]''.  The [[CD]] single issued on 2 October 1992 contains both versions.{{sfn|The Beatles Studio|2009}} The Pete Best version remained unreleased until 1995, when it was included on the ''[[Anthology 1]]'' album.\n\nCapitol Records Canada pressed 170 singles which were released on 4 February 1963 with catalogue number 72076.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hemmingsen|first=Piers A.|title=The Beatles \u2013 Original 45s pressed in Canada (1962\u20131970)|url=http://www.capitol6000.com/beatles45.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Toronto Star|title=How The Beatles got their start in Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2013/02/18/how_the_beatles_got_their_start_in_canada.html|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> This pressing was dubbed from the original UK single and featured Ringo Starr on drums.<ref>{{cite web|title=LOVE ME DO B/W P.S. I LOVE YOU CAPITOL OF CANADA 72076 RELEASED: 2/4/63|url=http://www.fab4collectibles.com/sa45.htm}}</ref>\n\n\"Love Me Do\", featuring Starr drumming, was also recorded eight times at the [[BBC]] and played on the BBC radio programmes ''Here We Go'', ''Talent Spot'', ''Saturday Club'', ''Side By Side'', ''Pop Go The Beatles'' and ''Easy Beat'' between October 1962 and October 1963. The version of \"Love Me Do\" recorded on 10 July 1963 at the BBC and broadcast on the 23 July 1963 ''Pop Go the Beatles'' programme can be heard on The Beatles' album ''[[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]''. The Beatles also performed the song live on the 20 February 1963 ''Parade of the Pops'' BBC radio broadcast.\n\nIn 1969, during the ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Get Back sessions]]'', The Beatles played the song in a slower, more bluesy form than they had in earlier recordings. This version of \"Love Me Do\" is one of many recordings made during these sessions and subsequently appeared on some bootlegs. The song featured no harmonica by Lennon, and McCartney sang the majority of the song in the same vocal style he used for \"[[Lady Madonna]]\".\n\n==Background==\n\n===First recording session and use of harmonica===\nOn 4 September 1962, [[Brian Epstein]] paid for the Beatles\u2014along with their new drummer, Ringo Starr\u2014to fly down from [[Liverpool]] to London.{{sfn|Norman|1993|p=154}} After first checking into their [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] hotel, they arrived at EMI Studios early in the afternoon where they set up their equipment in Studio 3 and began rehearsing six songs including: \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", \"Love Me Do\" and a song originally composed for [[Adam Faith]] by [[Mitch Murray]] called \"[[How Do You Do It?]]\" which George Martin \"was insisting, in the apparent absence of any stronger original material, would be the group's first single\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}}{{sfn|Marsden|p=36}} Lennon and McCartney had yet to impress Martin with their songwriting ability, and the Beatles had been signed as recording artists on the basis of their charismatic appeal: \"It wasn't a question of what they could do [as] they hadn't written anything great at that time.\"{{sfn|Marsden|p=34}} \"But what impressed me most was their personalities. Sparks flew off them when you talked to them.\"{{sfn|Badman|p=40}} During the course of an evening session that then followed (7:00&nbsp;pm to 10:00&nbsp;pm in Studio 2) they recorded \"How Do You Do It\" and \"Love Me Do\". An attempt at \"Please Please Me\" was made, but at this stage it was quite different from its eventual treatment and it was dropped by Martin. This was a disappointment for the group as they had hoped it would be the B-side to \"Love Me Do\".{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=528}}\n\nThe Beatles were keen to record their own material, something which was almost unheard of at that time, and it is generally accepted that it is to George Martin's credit that they were allowed to float their own ideas. But Martin insisted that unless they could write something as commercial as \"How Do You Do It?\" then the [[Tin Pan Alley]] practice of having the group record songs by professional songwriters (which was standard procedure then, and is still common today) would be followed.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} MacDonald points out, however: \"It's almost certainly true that there was no other producer on either side of the Atlantic then capable of handling the Beatles without damaging them\u2014let alone of cultivating and catering to them with the gracious, open-minded adeptness for which George Martin is universally respected in the British pop industry.\" Martin rejects however the view that he was the \"genius\" behind the group: \"I was purely an interpreter. The genius was theirs: no doubt about that.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=56}}\n\nIt was on the 4 September session that, according to McCartney, Martin suggested using a [[harmonica]].<ref name=\"miles 1997\" /> However, Lennon's harmonica part was present on the ''Anthology 1'' version of the song recorded during the 6 June audition with [[Pete Best]] on drums.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=55}} Also, Martin's own recollection of this is different, saying: \"I picked up on 'Love Me Do' because of the harmonica sound\", adding: \"I loved wailing harmonica\u2014it reminded me of the records I used to issue of [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. I felt it had a definite appeal.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|p=28}}\n\nLennon had learned to play a [[chromatic harmonica]] that his Uncle George (late husband of his [[Aunt Mimi]]) had given to him as a child. But the instrument being used at this time was one stolen by Lennon from a music shop in [[Arnhem]], the [[Netherlands]], in 1960, as the Beatles first journeyed to [[Hamburg]] by road.{{sfn|Norman|1993|p=78}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|p=28}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=45}} Lennon would have had this with him at the EMI audition on 6 June as Bruce Channel's \"Hey Baby\", with its harmonica intro, and a hit in the UK in March 1962, was one of the thirty three songs the Beatles had prepared (although only four were recorded: \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\"; \"Love Me Do\"; \"P.S. I Love You\" and \"[[Ask Me Why]]\", of which only \"B\u00e9same Mucho\" and \"Love Me Do\" survive and appear on ''[[Anthology 1]]''). Brian Epstein had also booked the American Bruce Channel to top a [[NEMS Enterprises]] promotion at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]]'s Tower Ballroom, in [[Wallasey]] on 21 June 1962, just a few weeks after \"Hey Baby\" had charted, and placed the Beatles a prestigious second on the bill. Lennon was so impressed that night with Channel's harmonica player, [[Delbert McClinton]],{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=147}} that he later approached him for advice on how to play the instrument.{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=414}} Lennon makes reference also to [[Frank Ifield]]'s \"[[I Remember You (1941 song)|I Remember You]]\" and its harmonica intro, a huge number one hit in the UK July 1962, saying: \"The gimmick was the harmonica. There was a terrible thing called \"I Remember You\", and we did those numbers; and we started using it on \"Love Me Do\" just for arrangements\".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=81}} The harmonica was to become a feature of the Beatles' early hits such as \"Love Me Do\", \"Please Please Me\" and \"[[From Me to You]]\" as well as various album tracks. Paul McCartney recalled, \"John expected to be in jail one day and he'd be the guy who played the harmonica.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=87 \u2013 'Love Me Do'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/love-me-do-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\nMartin came very close to issuing \"How Do You Do It?\" as the Beatles' first single (it would also re-appear as a contender for their second single){{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=77}} before settling instead on \"Love Me Do\", as a mastered version of it was made ready for release and which still exists in EMI's archives.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} Martin commented later: \"I looked very hard at 'How Do You Do It?', but in the end I went with 'Love Me Do', it was quite a good record.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} McCartney would remark: \"We knew that the peer pressure back in Liverpool would not allow us to do 'How Do You Do It'.\"{{sfn|Miles|1992|p=83}}\n\n===Remake and Andy White===\nMartin then decided that as \"Love Me Do\" was going to be the group's debut release it needed to be re-recorded with a different drummer as he was unhappy with the 4 September drum sound{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} (Abbey Road's [[Ken Townsend]] also recalls McCartney being dissatisfied with Starr's timing, due probably to his being under-rehearsed; Starr had joined the group only two weeks before the 4 September session).{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=58\u201359}} Record producers at that time were used to hearing the bass drum \"lock in\" with the bass guitar as opposed to the much looser [[R&B]] feel that was just beginning to emerge, and so professional show band drummers were often used for recordings. Ron Richards, placed in charge of the 11 September re-recording session in George Martin's absence, booked [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] whom he had used in the past. Starr was expecting to play, and was very disappointed to be dropped for only his second Beatles recording session: Richards remembers \"He just sat there quietly in the control box next to me. Then I asked him to play maracas on 'P.S. I Love You'. Ringo is lovely\u2014always easy going\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} Starr recalled: \"On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I remember that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca in one hand and a tambourine in the other. I think it's because of that that George Martin used Andy White, the 'professional', when we went down a week later to record Love Me Do. The guy was previously booked, anyway, because of Pete Best. George didn't want to take any more chances and I was caught in the middle. I was devastated that George Martin had his doubts about me. I came down ready to roll and heard, 'We've got a professional drummer.' He has apologised several times since, has old George, but it was devastating\u2014I hated the bugger for years; I still don't let him off the hook!\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=76}} Paul McCartney: \"George got his way and Ringo didn't drum on the first single. He only played tambourine. I don't think Ringo ever got over that. He had to go back up to Liverpool and everyone asked, 'How did it go in the Smoke?' We'd say, 'B-side's good,' but Ringo couldn't admit to liking the A-side, not being on it\" (from ''Anthology'').<ref name=BB /> \"Love Me Do\" was recorded with White playing drums and Starr on tambourine, but whether using a session drummer solved the problem is unclear, as session engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] was to comment: \"It was a real headache trying to get a [good] drum sound, and when you listen to the record now you can hardly hear the drums at all.\"{{sfn|Southall|1982|p=83}} Ringo Starr's version was mixed \"bottom-light\" to hide Starr's bass drum.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=52}}\n\nEarly pressings of the single (issued with a red Parlophone label) are the 4 September version\u2014minus tambourine\u2014with Starr playing drums. But later pressings of the single (on a black Parlophone label), and the version used for the ''Please Please Me'' album, are the 11 September re-record with Andy White on drums and Starr on tambourine. This difference has become fundamental in telling the two recordings of \"Love Me Do\" apart. Regarding the editing sessions that then followed all these various takes, Ron Richards remembers the whole thing being a bit fraught, saying: \"Quite honestly, by the time it came out I was pretty sick of it. I didn't think it would do anything.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|1986|p=135}}\n\n===Ron Richards===\nThere are major discrepancies regarding the White session, and who produced it. In his book ''Summer of Love'', Martin concedes that his version of events differs from some accounts, saying: \"On the 6 June Beatles session (audition) I decided that Pete Best had to go [and said to Epstein] I don't care what you do with Pete Best; but he's not playing on any more recording sessions: I'm getting a session drummer in.\"{{sfn|Martin|1995|p=143}} When Starr turned up with the group for their first proper recording session on 4 September, Martin says that he was totally unaware that the Beatles had fired Best; and, not knowing \"how good, bad or indifferent\" Starr was, was not prepared to \"waste precious studio time finding out.\"{{sfn|Martin|1995|p=143}} Martin, therefore, appears to have this as the Andy White session in which Martin was present, and not 11 September. This contradicts [[Mark Lewisohn]]'s account, as in his book ''The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions'', he has Starr on drums on 4 September{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} and White for the 11 September re-make.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} Lewisohn also says that Richards was in charge on 11 September, which means, if accurate, that Richards was sole producer of the White version of \"Love Me Do\". Martin says, \"My diary shows that I did not oversee any Beatles recording sessions on 11 September\u2014only the one on 4 September.\"{{sfn|Martin|1995|p=143}} But, if Lewisohn's account is correct and \"the 4 September session really hadn't proved good enough to satisfy George Martin\",{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} it might seem odd that Martin was not then present to oversee the 11 September remake.\n\nIn his memoirs, assistant engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] supports the Lewisohn version, recounting that Starr played drums at the 4 September session (Emerick's second day at EMI) and that Martin, Smith, and McCartney were all dissatisfied with (the underrehearsed) Starr's timekeeping.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|p=46}} Emerick places White firmly at the second session, and describes the reactions of [[Mal Evans]] and Starr to the substitution.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|pp=49\u201352}} Emerick also noted that Martin only came in very late for the 11 September session, after work on \"Love Me Do\" was complete.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|pp=49\u201352}}\n\nAndy White confirms that he was booked by Ron Richards for the 11 September session, not by George Martin, who he says \"could not make the session, could not get there till the end, so he had Ron Richards handle it\". White also says that he recognises his own drumming on the released version of \"Please Please Me\", recorded that same session with him on drums.<ref>interview for \"Love Me Do: The Beatles '62\", BBC TV 9 October 2012</ref> White, however was not at the studio for the final recording on 26 November and was only hired for the 11 September session (this run through with White can be heard on ''Anthology 1'').\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n* Number one on US charts (30 May 1964), Top 100 for 14 weeks. When it entered the charts, it was due to sales of imported copies from [[Canada]] with Starr on drums.{{sfn|Cash Box|1964}} On 27 April 1964, it was released in the US by [[Vee-Jay Records]] on the [[Tollie Records|Tollie]] label{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}} with White on drums.\n\nThe song was the fourth of six songs by the Beatles to hit number one in a one-year period; an all-time record for the US charts. In order, these were \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\", \"[[She Loves You]]\", \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", \"Love Me Do\", \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\", and \"[[I Feel Fine]]\". It was also the fourth of seven songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney to hit number one in 1964 (the other being \"[[A World Without Love]]\", recorded by [[Peter and Gordon]]). That remains an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number one in the same calendar year. <small>(see [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones]])</small>\n\n===Charts===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1962\u201364)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book | title=Australian Chart Book (1940\u20131969) | author=Kent, David | publisher=Australian Chart Book | location=Turramurra | year=2005 | isbn=0-646-44439-5}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Canada [[CHUM Chart]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Ron |title=The CHUM Chart Book: A Complete Listing of Every Record to Make the \"CHUM Chart\" from Its Beginning on the 27th May, 1957 Through 14th June, 1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEnYAAAACAAJ|date=1990 |publisher=Stardust Productions |location=Rexdale (Toronto) |isbn=0-920325-15-7 |page=11 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qartistid=8#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 4 June 1964]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UK|17|date=1963-01-02|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=The Beatles|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|US [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cash Box'' Top 100]]<ref>{{cite book| first=Frank| last=Hoffmann| year=1983| title=The Cash Box Singles Charts, 1950\u20131981| publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc| location=Metuchen, NJ & London| pages= 32\u201334}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n!Chart (1982)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Belgium (Flanders)|37|artist=The Beatles|song=Love Me Do|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|4|artist=The Beatles|song=Love Me Do|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Dutch100|32|artist=The Beatles|song=Love Me Do|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UK|4|date=1963-01-02|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|}\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Certifications===\n\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|artist=The Beatles|title=Love Me Do|award=Platinum|relyear=1964|certyear=2014|type=single|accessdate=15 May 2016}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Missing master tape==\nThe original master tapes of the 4 September version of \"Love Me Do\" are not known to exist. Standard procedure at Abbey Road Studios at the time was to erase the original two-track session tape for singles once they had been \"mixed down\" to the (usually [[monaural]]) [[master tape]] used to press records. This was the fate of two Beatles singles (four songs): \"Love Me Do\", \"P.S. I Love You\", \"[[She Loves You]]\", and \"[[I'll Get You]]\". However, at some point the mixdown master tape for this song was also lost, and apparently no backup copies had been made. Thus, for many years the only extant recorded copies were the red label Parlophone 45&nbsp;rpm vinyl records pressed in 1962. This version was also issued in Canada as Capitol 72076.{{sfn|Seely|2009}}\n\nBy the time the tapes had disappeared, the song's 11 September 1962 remake featuring Andy White had been released. EMI would not have been too concerned about the loss of the 4 September take, therefore, as it was now considered obsolete, and they may not have anticipated ever having any use for it again anyway.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nAround 1980, a reasonably clean, original 45 single from EMI's archives was used as the \"best available source\" for the track's inclusion on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] [[compilation album|compilation]] [[Album|LP]] ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]''. A few years later, a new master tape was struck, this time using another, better-sounding 45 supplied by a record collector, and this has served as the official EMI master tape for the original \"Love Me Do\" ever since.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==50th anniversary mix-up and release==\nEMI released a 50th anniversary limited-edition replica of the original single, featuring \"Love Me Do\" backed with \"P.S. I Love You\", in October 2012.\n\nThe 7-inch disc was originally scheduled to hit stores on 5 October but was recalled when it was discovered that the pressings contained the Andy White version instead of the Ringo Starr version as intended. Although the White version was ordered to be destroyed, it is possible some copies do exist. The correct version with Ringo Starr on drums was issued on 22 October 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.beatlesbible.com/2012/10/03/love-me-do-emi-apple-withdrawn-anniversary-vinyl-single/|title=Love Me Don\u2019t: EMI withdraws anniversary single|date=2012-10-03|work=The Beatles Bible|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-50th-anniversary-love-me-do-single-gets-new-release-date/|title=Beatles 50th Anniversary 'Love Me Do' Single Gets New Release Date|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\nOn the version released on the original UK single, the US album ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'', ''[[Past Masters]]'', and ''[[Mono Masters]]'':\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, [[harmonica]]\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic guitar\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 [[drums]]\n\nOn the version released on ''[[Please Please Me]]'', ''[[The Beatles' Hits]]'', the US single, and compilation albums including ''[[1962\u20131966]]'' (\"The Red Album\") and ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'':\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, bass\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, harmonica\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic guitar\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 tambourine\n*[[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] \u2013 drums\n\nOn the ''[[Anthology 1]]'' version:\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, bass\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, harmonica\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic guitar\n*[[Pete Best]] \u2013 drums\n\nEngineered by [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]].<ref name=BB />{{better source|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Recording and mixing details==\n*6 June 1962: an unknown number of takes recorded for what was most likely an artist test.{{Sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=16\u201317}}\n*4 September 1962: an unknown number of takes recorded.

I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]\". When the [[Single (music)|single]] was originally released in the United Kingdom on 5 October 1962, it peaked at number 17. In 1982 it was re-promoted (not re-issued, retaining the same catalogue number) and reached number four. It was released in the United States in 1964, where it became a number one hit.\n\nThe song was written several years before it was recorded, and prior to the existence of the Beatles. The single features John Lennon's prominent harmonica playing and duet vocals by him and Paul McCartney. Three different recorded versions of the song by the Beatles have been released, each with a different drummer.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Love Me Do\" was primarily written by [[Paul McCartney]] in 1958\u20131959 while [[truant]] from school at age 16.{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=413}} [[John Lennon]] contributed the [[middle eight]] (or \"bridge\").{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=413}}<ref name=\"miles 1997\">Miles (1997).</ref>{{sfn|Beatles Interview Database|2009}} The song was later credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=413}} Lennon said: \"'Love Me Do' is Paul's song ... I do know he had the song around, in Hamburg, even, way, way before we were songwriters.\"<ref name=BB>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/love-me-do/|title=Love Me Do|work=The Beatles Bible}}</ref> McCartney said: \"'Love Me Do' was completely co-written ... It was just Lennon and McCartney sitting down without either of us having a particularly original idea. We loved doing it, it was a very interesting thing to try and learn to do, to become songwriters. I think why we eventually got so strong was we wrote so much through our formative period. 'Love Me Do' was our first hit, which ironically is one of the two songs that we control, because when we first signed to EMI they had a music publishing company called Ardmore and Beechwood which took the two songs, 'Love Me Do' and '[[P.S. I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]', and in doing a deal somewhere along the way we were able to get them back.\"<ref name=BB /><ref>Barry Miles. ''Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now''</ref>\n\nTheir practice at the time was to scribble songs in a school notebook, dreaming of stardom, always writing \"Another Lennon\u2013McCartney Original\" at the top of the page.<ref name=rollingstone /> \"Love Me Do\" is a song based around three simple chords: G7 and C, before moving to D for its middle eight. It begins with Lennon playing a [[blues]]y dry \"dockside harmonica\" riff, {{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p51}} then features Lennon and McCartney on joint lead vocals, including [[Everly Brothers]]-style harmonising during the beseeching \"''please''\" before McCartney sings the unaccompanied vocal line on the song's title phrase.\n\nLennon had previously sung the title sections, but this change in arrangement was made in the studio under the direction of [[Record producer|producer]] [[George Martin]] when he realised that the harmonica part encroached on the vocal (Lennon needed to begin playing the harmonica again on the same beat as the \"do\" of \"love me do\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=59}} However, when a similar situation later occurred on the \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" single session the harmonica was superimposed afterwards using tape-to-tape [[overdubbing]]).{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=23}} Described by Ian MacDonald as \"standing out like a bare brick wall in a suburban sitting-room, 'Love Me Do', [with its] blunt working class northerness, rang the first faint chime of a revolutionary bell\" compared to the standard [[Tin Pan Alley]] productions occupying the charts at the time.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=52\u201353}}\n\n==Recordings and releases==\n\"Love Me Do\" was recorded by the Beatles on three different occasions with three different drummers at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] at 3 Abbey Road in London:\n* EMI Artist Test (The Beatles audition for [[George Martin]]) on 6 June 1962 with [[Pete Best]] on drums.{{Sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=16\u201317}} This version (previously thought to be lost) is available on ''[[Anthology 1]]''.\n* First proper recording session, 4 September 1962. In August, Best had been replaced with [[Ringo Starr]]. Producer George Martin did not approve of Best's drumming for studio work. It was the norm at that time to have a specialist studio drummer who knew the ways of studio work. The decision to fire Best was not Martin's. The Beatles with Starr recorded a version at EMI Studios.{{Sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=18\u201319}} They recorded \"Love Me Do\" in 15 takes. This version with Starr is available on ''[[Past Masters]]''.\n* Second recording session, 11 September 1962. A week later, The Beatles returned to the same studio and they made a recording of \"Love Me Do\" with session drummer [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] on drums. Starr was relegated to playing tambourine. As tambourine is not present on the 4 September recording, this is the easiest way to distinguish between the Starr and White recordings.  The Andy White version is available on ''[[Please Please Me]]''.\n\nFirst issues of the single, released on [[Parlophone]] in the UK on 5 October 1962, featured the Ringo Starr version, prompting [[Mark Lewisohn]] to later write: \"Clearly, the 11 September version was not regarded as having been a significant improvement after all\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|p=22}}\n\nThe Andy White version of the track was included on The Beatles' debut UK album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'', ''[[The Beatles' Hits|The Beatles' Hits EP]]'', and subsequent album releases on which \"Love Me Do\" was included (except as noted below), as well as on the first US single release in April 1964. For the 1976 single re-issue and the 1982 \"20th Anniversary\" re-issue, the Andy White version was again used. The Ringo Starr version was included on the albums ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'' (US version), ''[[Past Masters]]'', and ''[[Mono Masters]]''.  It was also included on Record 1 of ''[[The Beatles Box]]''.

The version of \"Love Me Do\" recorded on 10 July 1963 at the BBC and broadcast on the 23 July 1963 ''Pop Go the Beatles'' programme can be heard on The Beatles' album ''[[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]''. The Beatles also performed the song live on the 20 February 1963 ''Parade of the Pops'' BBC radio broadcast.\n\nIn 1969, during the ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Get Back sessions]]'', The Beatles played the song in a slower, more bluesy form than they had in earlier recordings. This version of \"Love Me Do\" is one of many recordings made during these sessions and subsequently appeared on some bootlegs. The song featured no harmonica by Lennon, and McCartney sang the majority of the song in the same vocal style he used for \"[[Lady Madonna]]\".\n\n==Background==\n\n===First recording session and use of harmonica===\nOn 4 September 1962, [[Brian Epstein]] paid for the Beatles\u2014along with their new drummer, Ringo Starr\u2014to fly down from [[Liverpool]] to London.{{sfn|Norman|1993|p=154}} After first checking into their [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] hotel, they arrived at EMI Studios early in the afternoon where they set up their equipment in Studio 3 and began rehearsing six songs including: \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", \"Love Me Do\" and a song originally composed for [[Adam Faith]] by [[Mitch Murray]] called \"[[How Do You Do It?]]\" which George Martin \"was insisting, in the apparent absence of any stronger original material, would be the group's first single\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}}{{sfn|Marsden|p=36}} Lennon and McCartney had yet to impress Martin with their songwriting ability, and the Beatles had been signed as recording artists on the basis of their charismatic appeal: \"It wasn't a question of what they could do [as] they hadn't written anything great at that time.\"{{sfn|Marsden|p=34}} \"But what impressed me most was their personalities. Sparks flew off them when you talked to them.\"{{sfn|Badman|p=40}} During the course of an evening session that then followed (7:00&nbsp;pm to 10:00&nbsp;pm in Studio 2) they recorded \"How Do You Do It\" and \"Love Me Do\". An attempt at \"Please Please Me\" was made, but at this stage it was quite different from its eventual treatment and it was dropped by Martin. This was a disappointment for the group as they had hoped it would be the B-side to \"Love Me Do\".{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=528}}\n\nThe Beatles were keen to record their own material, something which was almost unheard of at that time, and it is generally accepted that it is to George Martin's credit that they were allowed to float their own ideas. But Martin insisted that unless they could write something as commercial as \"How Do You Do It?\" then the [[Tin Pan Alley]] practice of having the group record songs by professional songwriters (which was standard procedure then, and is still common today) would be followed.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} MacDonald points out, however: \"It's almost certainly true that there was no other producer on either side of the Atlantic then capable of handling the Beatles without damaging them\u2014let alone of cultivating and catering to them with the gracious, open-minded adeptness for which George Martin is universally respected in the British pop industry.\" Martin rejects however the view that he was the \"genius\" behind the group: \"I was purely an interpreter. The genius was theirs: no doubt about that.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=56}}\n\nIt was on the 4 September session that, according to McCartney, Martin suggested using a [[harmonica]].<ref name=\"miles 1997\" /> However, Lennon's harmonica part was present on the ''Anthology 1'' version of the song recorded during the 6 June audition with [[Pete Best]] on drums.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=55}} Also, Martin's own recollection of this is different, saying: \"I picked up on 'Love Me Do' because of the harmonica sound\", adding: \"I loved wailing harmonica\u2014it reminded me of the records I used to issue of [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]]. I felt it had a definite appeal.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|p=28}}\n\nLennon had learned to play a [[chromatic harmonica]] that his Uncle George (late husband of his [[Aunt Mimi]]) had given to him as a child. But the instrument being used at this time was one stolen by Lennon from a music shop in [[Arnhem]], the [[Netherlands]], in 1960, as the Beatles first journeyed to [[Hamburg]] by road.{{sfn|Norman|1993|p=78}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|p=28}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=45}} Lennon would have had this with him at the EMI audition on 6 June as Bruce Channel's \"Hey Baby\", with its harmonica intro, and a hit in the UK in March 1962, was one of the thirty three songs the Beatles had prepared (although only four were recorded: \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\"; \"Love Me Do\"; \"P.S. I Love You\" and \"[[Ask Me Why]]\", of which only \"B\u00e9same Mucho\" and \"Love Me Do\" survive and appear on ''[[Anthology 1]]''). Brian Epstein had also booked the American Bruce Channel to top a [[NEMS Enterprises]] promotion at [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]]'s Tower Ballroom, in [[Wallasey]] on 21 June 1962, just a few weeks after \"Hey Baby\" had charted, and placed the Beatles a prestigious second on the bill. Lennon was so impressed that night with Channel's harmonica player, [[Delbert McClinton]],{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=147}} that he later approached him for advice on how to play the instrument.{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=414}} Lennon makes reference also to [[Frank Ifield]]'s \"[[I Remember You (1941 song)|I Remember You]]\" and its harmonica intro, a huge number one hit in the UK July 1962, saying: \"The gimmick was the harmonica. There was a terrible thing called \"I Remember You\", and we did those numbers; and we started using it on \"Love Me Do\" just for arrangements\".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=81}} The harmonica was to become a feature of the Beatles' early hits such as \"Love Me Do\", \"Please Please Me\" and \"[[From Me to You]]\" as well as various album tracks. Paul McCartney recalled, \"John expected to be in jail one day and he'd be the guy who played the harmonica.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=87 \u2013 'Love Me Do'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/love-me-do-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\nMartin came very close to issuing \"How Do You Do It?\" as the Beatles' first single (it would also re-appear as a contender for their second single){{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=77}} before settling instead on \"Love Me Do\", as a mastered version of it was made ready for release and which still exists in EMI's archives.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} Martin commented later: \"I looked very hard at 'How Do You Do It?', but in the end I went with 'Love Me Do', it was quite a good record.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} McCartney would remark: \"We knew that the peer pressure back in Liverpool would not allow us to do 'How Do You Do It'.\"{{sfn|Miles|1992|p=83}}\n\n===Remake and Andy White===\nMartin then decided that as \"Love Me Do\" was going to be the group's debut release it needed to be re-recorded with a different drummer as he was unhappy with the 4 September drum sound{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} (Abbey Road's [[Ken Townsend]] also recalls McCartney being dissatisfied with Starr's timing, due probably to his being under-rehearsed; Starr had joined the group only two weeks before the 4 September session).{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=58\u201359}} Record producers at that time were used to hearing the bass drum \"lock in\" with the bass guitar as opposed to the much looser [[R&B]] feel that was just beginning to emerge, and so professional show band drummers were often used for recordings. Ron Richards, placed in charge of the 11 September re-recording session in George Martin's absence, booked [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] whom he had used in the past. Starr was expecting to play, and was very disappointed to be dropped for only his second Beatles recording session: Richards remembers \"He just sat there quietly in the control box next to me. Then I asked him to play maracas on 'P.S. I Love You'. Ringo is lovely\u2014always easy going\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} Starr recalled: \"On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I remember that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca in one hand and a tambourine in the other. I think it's because of that that George Martin used Andy White, the 'professional', when we went down a week later to record Love Me Do. The guy was previously booked, anyway, because of Pete Best. George didn't want to take any more chances and I was caught in the middle. I was devastated that George Martin had his doubts about me. I came down ready to roll and heard, 'We've got a professional drummer.' He has apologised several times since, has old George, but it was devastating\u2014I hated the bugger for years; I still don't let him off the hook!\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=76}} Paul McCartney: \"George got his way and Ringo didn't drum on the first single. He only played tambourine. I don't think Ringo ever got over that. He had to go back up to Liverpool and everyone asked, 'How did it go in the Smoke?' We'd say, 'B-side's good,' but Ringo couldn't admit to liking the A-side, not being on it\" (from ''Anthology'').<ref name=BB /> \"Love Me Do\" was recorded with White playing drums and Starr on tambourine, but whether using a session drummer solved the problem is unclear, as session engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] was to comment: \"It was a real headache trying to get a [good] drum sound, and when you listen to the record now you can hardly hear the drums at all.\"{{sfn|Southall|1982|p=83}} Ringo Starr's version was mixed \"bottom-light\" to hide Starr's bass drum.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=52}}\n\nEarly pressings of the single (issued with a red Parlophone label) are the 4 September version\u2014minus tambourine\u2014with Starr playing drums. But later pressings of the single (on a black Parlophone label), and the version used for the ''Please Please Me'' album, are the 11 September re-record with Andy White on drums and Starr on tambourine. This difference has become fundamental in telling the two recordings of \"Love Me Do\" apart. Regarding the editing sessions that then followed all these various takes, Ron Richards remembers the whole thing being a bit fraught, saying: \"Quite honestly, by the time it came out I was pretty sick of it. I didn't think it would do anything.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|1986|p=135}}\n\n===Ron Richards===\nThere are major discrepancies regarding the White session, and who produced it. In his book ''Summer of Love'', Martin concedes that his version of events differs from some accounts, saying: \"On the 6 June Beatles session (audition) I decided that Pete Best had to go [and said to Epstein] I don't care what you do with Pete Best; but he's not playing on any more recording sessions: I'm getting a session drummer in.\"{{sfn|Martin|1995|p=143}} When Starr turned up with the group for their first proper recording session on 4 September, Martin says that he was totally unaware that the Beatles had fired Best; and, not knowing \"how good, bad or indifferent\" Starr was, was not prepared to \"waste precious studio time finding out.\"{{sfn|Martin|1995|p=143}} Martin, therefore, appears to have this as the Andy White session in which Martin was present, and not 11 September. This contradicts [[Mark Lewisohn]]'s account, as in his book ''The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions'', he has Starr on drums on 4 September{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} and White for the 11 September re-make.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} Lewisohn also says that Richards was in charge on 11 September, which means, if accurate, that Richards was sole producer of the White version of \"Love Me Do\". Martin says, \"My diary shows that I did not oversee any Beatles recording sessions on 11 September\u2014only the one on 4 September.\"{{sfn|Martin|1995|p=143}} But, if Lewisohn's account is correct and \"the 4 September session really hadn't proved good enough to satisfy George Martin\",{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=20}} it might seem odd that Martin was not then present to oversee the 11 September remake.\n\nIn his memoirs, assistant engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] supports the Lewisohn version, recounting that Starr played drums at the 4 September session (Emerick's second day at EMI) and that Martin, Smith, and McCartney were all dissatisfied with (the underrehearsed) Starr's timekeeping.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|p=46}} Emerick places White firmly at the second session, and describes the reactions of [[Mal Evans]] and Starr to the substitution.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|pp=49\u201352}} Emerick also noted that Martin only came in very late for the 11 September session, after work on \"Love Me Do\" was complete.{{sfn|Emerick|2006|pp=49\u201352}}\n\nAndy White confirms that he was booked by Ron Richards for the 11 September session, not by George Martin, who he says \"could not make the session, could not get there till the end, so he had Ron Richards handle it\". White also says that he recognises his own drumming on the released version of \"Please Please Me\", recorded that same session with him on drums.<ref>interview for \"Love Me Do: The Beatles '62\", BBC TV 9 October 2012</ref> White, however was not at the studio for the final recording on 26 November and was only hired for the 11 September session (this run through with White can be heard on ''Anthology 1'').\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n* Number one on US charts (30 May 1964), Top 100 for 14 weeks. When it entered the charts, it was due to sales of imported copies from [[Canada]] with Starr on drums.{{sfn|Cash Box|1964}} On 27 April 1964, it was released in the US by [[Vee-Jay Records]] on the [[Tollie Records|Tollie]] label{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}} with White on drums.\n\nThe song was the fourth of six songs by the Beatles to hit number one in a one-year period; an all-time record for the US charts. In order, these were \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\", \"[[She Loves You]]\", \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", \"Love Me Do\", \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\", and \"[[I Feel Fine]]\". It was also the fourth of seven songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney to hit number one in 1964 (the other being \"[[A World Without Love]]\", recorded by [[Peter and Gordon]]). That remains an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number one in the same calendar year. <small>(see [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones]])</small>\n\n===Charts===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1962\u201364)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book | title=Australian Chart Book (1940\u20131969) | author=Kent, David | publisher=Australian Chart Book | location=Turramurra | year=2005 | isbn=0-646-44439-5}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Canada [[CHUM Chart]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Ron |title=The CHUM Chart Book: A Complete Listing of Every Record to Make the \"CHUM Chart\" from Its Beginning on the 27th May, 1957 Through 14th June, 1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEnYAAAACAAJ|date=1990 |publisher=Stardust Productions |location=Rexdale (Toronto) |isbn=0-920325-15-7 |page=11 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qartistid=8#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 4 June 1964]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UK|17|date=1963-01-02|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=The Beatles|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|US [[Cashbox (magazine)|''Cash Box'' Top 100]]<ref>{{cite book| first=Frank| last=Hoffmann| year=1983| title=The Cash Box Singles Charts, 1950\u20131981| publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc| location=Metuchen, NJ & London| pages= 32\u201334}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n!Chart (1982)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Belgium (Flanders)|37|artist=The Beatles|song=Love Me Do|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|4|artist=The Beatles|song=Love Me Do|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Dutch100|32|artist=The Beatles|song=Love Me Do|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UK|4|date=1963-01-02|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|}\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Certifications===\n\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|artist=The Beatles|title=Love Me Do|award=Platinum|relyear=1964|certyear=2014|type=single|accessdate=15 May 2016}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Missing master tape==\nThe original master tapes of the 4 September version of \"Love Me Do\" are not known to exist. Standard procedure at Abbey Road Studios at the time was to erase the original two-track session tape for singles once they had been \"mixed down\" to the (usually [[monaural]]) [[master tape]] used to press records. This was the fate of two Beatles singles (four songs): \"Love Me Do\", \"P.S. I Love You\", \"[[She Loves You]]\", and \"[[I'll Get You]]\". However, at some point the mixdown master tape for this song was also lost, and apparently no backup copies had been made. Thus, for many years the only extant recorded copies were the red label Parlophone 45&nbsp;rpm vinyl records pressed in 1962. This version was also issued in Canada as Capitol 72076.{{sfn|Seely|2009}}\n\nBy the time the tapes had disappeared, the song's 11 September 1962 remake featuring Andy White had been released. EMI would not have been too concerned about the loss of the 4 September take, therefore, as it was now considered obsolete, and they may not have anticipated ever having any use for it again anyway.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nAround 1980, a reasonably clean, original 45 single from EMI's archives was used as the \"best available source\" for the track's inclusion on the [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] [[compilation album|compilation]] [[Album|LP]] ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]''. A few years later, a new master tape was struck, this time using another, better-sounding 45 supplied by a record collector, and this has served as the official EMI master tape for the original \"Love Me Do\" ever since.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==50th anniversary mix-up and release==\nEMI released a 50th anniversary limited-edition replica of the original single, featuring \"Love Me Do\" backed with \"P.S. I Love You\", in October 2012.\n\nThe 7-inch disc was originally scheduled to hit stores on 5 October but was recalled when it was discovered that the pressings contained the Andy White version instead of the Ringo Starr version as intended. Although the White version was ordered to be destroyed, it is possible some copies do exist. The correct version with Ringo Starr on drums was issued on 22 October 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.beatlesbible.com/2012/10/03/love-me-do-emi-apple-withdrawn-anniversary-vinyl-single/|title=Love Me Don\u2019t: EMI withdraws anniversary single|date=2012-10-03|work=The Beatles Bible|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/beatles-50th-anniversary-love-me-do-single-gets-new-release-date/|title=Beatles 50th Anniversary 'Love Me Do' Single Gets New Release Date|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\nOn the version released on the original UK single, the US album ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'', ''[[Past Masters]]'', and ''[[Mono Masters]]'':\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, [[harmonica]]\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic guitar\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 [[drums]]\n\nOn the version released on ''[[Please Please Me]]'', ''[[The Beatles' Hits]]'', the US single, and compilation albums including ''[[1962\u20131966]]'' (\"The Red Album\") and ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'':\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, bass\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, harmonica\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic guitar\n*[[Ringo Starr]] \u2013 tambourine\n*[[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] \u2013 drums\n\nOn the ''[[Anthology 1]]'' version:\n*[[Paul McCartney]] \u2013 vocals, bass\n*[[John Lennon]] \u2013 vocals, harmonica\n*[[George Harrison]] \u2013 acoustic guitar\n*[[Pete Best]] \u2013 drums\n\nEngineered by [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]].<ref name=BB />{{better source|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Recording and mixing details==\n*6 June 1962: an unknown number of takes recorded for what was most likely an artist test.{{Sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=16\u201317}}\n*4 September 1962: an unknown number of takes recorded.
