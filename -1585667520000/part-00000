{"title_page": "List of socialist states", "text_new": "{{short description|List of self-declared socialist states}}\n{{about|self-proclaimed socialist states|countries governed by Marxist\u2013Leninist communist parties|Communist state|constitutional references to socialism in multi-party democracies|Socialism in liberal democratic constitutions|countries constitutionally committed to socialism|Socialist state}}\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nSeveral past and present [[State (polity)|states]] have declared themselves [[socialist state]]s or in the process of building [[socialism]]. The majority of self-declared socialist countries have been [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] or inspired by it, following the model of the [[Soviet Union]] or some form of [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's]] or [[National democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|national democracy]]. They share a common definition of socialism and they refer to themselves as socialist states on the road to [[communism]] with a leading [[vanguard party]] structure, hence they are called [[communist states]]. Meanwhile, the countries in the non-Marxist\u2013Leninist category represent a wide variety of different interpretations of the term socialism and in many cases the countries do not define what they mean by it. Modern uses of the term socialism are wide in meaning and interpretation.\n\nAs a [[sovereign state]] is a different entity from the [[political party]] that rules that state at any given time, a country may be ruled by a [[socialist party]] without the country itself claiming to be socialist, occurring in both [[One-party state|one-party]] and [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] political systems. In particular, there are numerous cases of [[social democratic]] and [[democratic socialist]] parties winning elections in [[liberal democratic]] states and ruling for a number of [[Term of office|terms]] until a different party wins the elections. While socialist parties won many elections around the world and most elections in the [[Nordic countries]], they did not adopt socialism as the [[state ideology]].\n\nSeveral countries with [[Socialism in liberal democratic constitutions|liberal democratic constitutions]] mention socialism. [[India]] is a liberal democracy that has been ruled by non-socialist parties on many occasions, but its [[Constitution of India|constitution]] makes references to socialism. Certain other countries such as [[Croatia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hr00000_.html|title=Croatia Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> [[Hungary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hu__indx.html|title=Hungary Index|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> [[Myanmar]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008|title=Myanmar 2008|publisher=Constitute Project|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> and [[Poland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl00000_.html|title=Poland - Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> have constitutions that make references to their communist and socialist past by recognizing or condemning it, but without claiming to be socialist in the present.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Self-identification]] is the only criterion used by the list, therefore it includes all countries that have claimed to be [[socialist]], even if their claims are disputed. All countries that have not claimed to be socialist are excluded, even in cases where certain outside observers regarded those countries as socialist. This list includes countries that assert in their [[constitution]]s that they are based on socialism, regardless of their economic or political system.<!-- As for countries with no written constitution... --> It does not list countries that do not have [[constitutional references to socialism]] as [[socialist state]]s, even in cases where the government is currently run by a [[socialist party]] or other [[left-wing]] ([[centre-left]] and [[far-left]]) parties. On the other hand, countries that do maintain constitutional references to socialism are listed, even when those countries are ruled by non-socialist parties. As a result, this list is best understood as a list of countries that explicitly claim to be socialist and it does not reflect the actual economic systems themselves.

present [[State (polity)|states]] have declared themselves [[socialist state]]s or in the process of building [[socialism]]. The majority of self-declared socialist countries have been [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] or inspired by it, following the model of the [[Soviet Union]] or some form of [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's]] or [[National democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|national democracy]]. They share a common definition of socialism and they refer to themselves as socialist states on the road to [[communism]] with a leading [[vanguard party]] structure, hence they are called [[communist states]]. Meanwhile, the countries in the non-Marxist\u2013Leninist category represent a wide variety of different interpretations of the term socialism and in many cases the countries do not define what they mean by it. Modern uses of the term socialism are wide in meaning and interpretation.\n\nAs a [[sovereign state]] is a different entity from the [[political party]] that rules that state at any given time, a country may be ruled by a [[socialist party]] without the country itself claiming to be socialist, occurring in both [[One-party state|one-party]] and [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] political systems. In particular, there are numerous cases of [[social democratic]] and [[democratic socialist]] parties winning elections in [[liberal democratic]] states and ruling for a number of [[Term of office|terms]] until a different party wins the elections. While socialist parties won many elections around the world and most elections in the [[Nordic countries]], they did not adopt socialism as the [[state ideology]].\n\nSeveral countries with [[Socialism in liberal democratic constitutions|liberal democratic constitutions]] mention socialism. [[India]] is a liberal democracy that has been ruled by non-socialist parties on many occasions, but its [[Constitution of India|constitution]] makes references to socialism. Certain other countries such as [[Croatia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hr00000_.html|title=Croatia Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> [[Hungary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hu__indx.html|title=Hungary Index|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> [[Myanmar]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008|title=Myanmar 2008|publisher=Constitute Project|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> and [[Poland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl00000_.html|title=Poland - Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> have constitutions that make references to their communist and socialist past by recognizing or condemning it, but without claiming to be socialist in the present.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Self-identification]] is the only criterion used by the list, therefore it includes all countries that have claimed to be [[socialist]], even if their claims are disputed. All countries that have not claimed to be socialist are excluded, even in cases where certain outside observers regarded those countries as socialist. This list includes countries that assert in their [[constitution]]s that they are based on socialism, regardless of their economic or political system.<!-- As for countries with no written constitution... --> It does not list countries that do not have [[constitutional references to socialism]] as [[socialist state]]s, even in cases where the government is currently run by a [[socialist party]] or other [[left-wing]] ([[centre-left]] and [[far-left]]) parties. On the other hand, countries that do maintain constitutional references to socialism are listed, even when those countries are ruled by non-socialist parties. As a result, this list is best understood as a list of countries that explicitly claim to be socialist and it does not reflect the actual economic systems themselves. The following images are a combined map of all countries that declared themselves socialist states under any definition at some point in their history, color-coded for the number of years they said they were socialist and by Soviet sources:\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| image1 = Socialist states by duration.png\n| width1 = 565\n| caption1 = Map of socialist states by duration\n{{legend|#FF0000|Over 70 years}}\n{{legend|#FF6600|60\u201370 years}}\n{{legend|#B0B000|50\u201360 years}}\n{{legend|#00CC00|40\u201350 years}}\n{{legend|#0000FF|30\u201340 years}}\n{{legend|#000033|20\u201330 years}}\n{{legend|#9966FF|Under 20 years}}\n| image2 = Communist Block.svg\n| width2 = 497\n| caption2 = Note that not all of the bright red states remained [[Soviet allies]]\n{{legend|#E00202|States that had [[communist government]]s}}\n{{legend|#DB5502|States that the [[Soviet Union]] believed at one point to be [[moving toward socialism]]}}\n{{legend|#D4CE26|Other [[socialist state]]s}}\n}}\n\n== Current socialist states ==\n=== Marxist\u2013Leninist states ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=100%\n!width=150px|Country\n!width=85px|Since\n!width=85px|Duration\n!width=100px|Form of government\n!width=95px|Party\n!width=95px|Head of party\n!width=95px|Head of state\n!width=95px|Head of government\n|-\n|{{flag|China|name=People's Republic of China}}{{refn|[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are administrated under the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" principle.

Formal recognition came with a treaty three years later, signed by both the new [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] in late 1825.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Landing of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Brazil, South America, 1500.]]\n\nThe land now called Brazil was claimed by the [[Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]] in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese naval fleet commanded by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]. The Portuguese encountered Indigenous nations divided into several tribes, most of whom shared the same [[Tupi\u2013Guarani languages]] family, and shared and disputed the territory. But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza killed tens of thousands{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThough the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively started in 1534 when [[John III of Portugal|King John III]] divided the territory into fifteen hereditary captaincies. This arrangement proved problematic, however, and in 1549 the king assigned a Governor-General to administer the entire colony. The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes while others slowly disappeared in long wars or by [[Europe]]an diseases to which they had no immunity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nBy the mid-16th century, [[sugar]] had become Brazil's most important export due to the increasing international demand for sugar. To profit from the situation, by 1700 over 963,000 African slaves had been brought across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to work in the plantations of Brazil. More Africans were brought to Brazil up until that date than to all the other places in [[Americas|The Americas]] ([[Western Hemisphere]]) combined.<ref>See the tables [http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces '''here'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027021745/http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces |date=2013-10-27 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 210\n | image1    = Departure of H.R.H. the Prince Regent of Portugal for the Brazils (Campaigns of the British Army in Portugal, London, 1812) - Henry L'Ev\u00eaque, F.

They sent military expeditions to the northwest of the [[South America]]n continent to the [[Amazon River]] basin rainforest and conquered competing [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] strongholds, founding villages and forts from 1669. In 1680 they reached the far southeast and founded [[Sacramento (Uruguay)|Sacramento]] on the bank of the [[Rio de la Plata]], in the ''[[Banda Oriental]]'' region (present-day [[Uruguay]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, sugar exports started to decline, but beginning in the 1690s, the discovery of gold by explorers in the region that would later be called [[Minas Gerais]] (General Mines) in current [[Mato Grosso]], [[Goi\u00e1s]] and the Brazilian state of [[Minas Gerais]] saved the colony from imminent collapse. From all over Brazil, as well as from Portugal, thousands of immigrants came to the mines in an early \"gold rush\".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] tried to prevent Portuguese expansion northwest, west, southwest and southeast into the territory that belonged to them according to the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] division of the [[New World]] of [[Americas|The Americas]] by the [[Bishop of Rome|Bishop and Pope of Rome]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1431-1503, reigned 1492-1503) and succeeded in conquering the ''Banda Oriental'' region in 1777. However, this was in vain as the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], signed in the same year, confirmed Portuguese sovereignty over all lands proceeding from its territorial expansion, thus creating most of the current Brazilian southeastern border.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nDuring the [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|French invasion of Portugal]], by Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] in 1807, the Portuguese royal family [[House of Braganza]] fled across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with the help of the British [[Royal Navy]] to Brazil, establishing [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the de facto capital of Portugal and Brazil and the [[Portuguese Empire]] during the ensuing worldwide [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803-1815).  This had the side effect of soon creating within Brazil, many of the institutions required to exist as an independent state; most importantly, it freed Brazil to trade with other nations at will.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter Napoleon's Imperial French army was finally defeated at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in June 1815, in order to maintain the capital in Brazil and allay Brazilian fears of being returned to colonial status, [[King John VI of Portugal]] raised the [[de jure]] status of Brazil to an equal, integral part of a new status in a [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], rather than a mere colony, a status which it enjoyed for the next seven years, sending his son, Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] as prince regent.\n\n==Path to independence==\n===Portuguese ''Cortes''===\n[[File:Portuguese Cortes 1822.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Portuguese ''Cortes'']]\nIn 1820 the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Constitutionalist Revolution]] erupted in [[Portugal]]. The movement initiated by the liberal constitutionalists resulted in the meeting of the ''[[Constituent Cortes of 1820|Cortes]]'' (or [[Constituent Assembly]]), that would have to create the kingdom's first [[constitution]].<ref>Lustosa, p.97</ref><ref>Armitage. p.36</ref> The ''Cortes'' at the same time demanded the return of King [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], who had been living in [[Brazil]] since 1808, who elevated Brazil to a kingdom as part of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] in 1815 and who nominated his son and heir prince Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] as [[regent]], to govern Brazil in his place on 7 March 1821.<ref>Lustosa, p.106</ref><ref>Armitage. p. 38</ref> The king left for Europe on 26 April, while Dom Pedro remained in Brazil governing it with the aid of the ministers of the Kingdom (Interior) and Foreign Affairs, [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)|of War, of Navy]] and [[Ministry of Finance (Brazil)|of Finance]].<ref>Lustosa, pp. 109\u201310</ref><ref>Armitage. p. 41</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese military officers headquartered in Brazil were completely sympathetic to the Constitutionalist movement in Portugal.<ref>Lustosa, p. 112</ref> The main leader of the Portuguese officers, General [[Jorge de Avilez Zuzarte de Sousa Tavares]] forced the prince to dismiss and banish from the country the ministers of Kingdom and Finance. Both were loyal allies of Pedro, who had become a pawn in the hands of the military.<ref>Lustosa, pp. 113\u201314</ref> The humiliation suffered by the prince, who swore he would never yield to the pressure of the military again, would have a decisive influence on his abdication ten years later.<ref>Lustosa, p. 114</ref> Meanwhile, on 30 September 1821, the ''Cortes'' approved a decree that subordinated the governments of the [[Brazilian provinces]] directly to Portugal. Prince Pedro became for all purposes only the governor of the [[Rio de Janeiro Province]].<ref name=\"Lustosa, p.117\">Lustosa, p. 117</ref><ref>Armitage. pp. 43\u201344</ref> Other decrees that came after ordered his return to Europe and also extinguished the judicial courts created by Jo\u00e3o VI in 1808.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p.119\">Lustosa, p.119</ref><ref>Armitage. pp. 48\u201351</ref>\n\nDissatisfaction over the ''Cortes'' measures among most residents in Brazil (both Brazilian-born and Portuguese-born) rose to a point that it soon became publicly known.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p.117\"/> Two groups that opposed the ''Cortes''' actions to gradually undermine the Brazilian sovereignty appeared: Liberals led by [[Joaquim Gon\u00e7alves Ledo]] (which had the support of the [[Freemason]]s) and the Bonifacians led by [[Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada e Silva|Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada]].

He reached its [[S\u00e3o Paulo|capital]] on 25 August and remained there until 5 September. While on his way back to Rio de Janeiro on 7 September he received mail from Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio and his wife, Leopoldina.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The letter told him that the ''Cortes'' had annulled all acts from the Bonif\u00e1cio cabinet, removed Pedro's remaining powers and ordered him to return to Portugal.  It was clear that independence was the only option left. Pedro turned to his companions that included his [[Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)|Guard of Honor]] and spoke: \"Friends, the Portuguese ''Cortes'' want to enslave and pursue us. From today on our relations are broken. No ties can unite us anymore\" and continued after he pulled out his blue-white armband that symbolized Portugal: \"Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to the independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil from Portugal!\" He unsheathed his sword affirming that \"For my blood, my honor, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom,\" and later cried out: \"Brazilians, Independence or death!\". This event is remembered as \"[[Cry of Ipiranga]]\".<ref>Lustosa, pp. 150\u201353</ref>\n\nReturning to the city of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] on the night of 7 September 1822, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] and his companions announced the news of Brazilian independence from Portugal. The Prince was received with great popular celebration and was called not only \"King of Brazil\", but also \"Emperor of Brazil\".<ref name=\"Vianna, p.408\">Vianna, p. 408</ref><ref>Lima (1997), p. 398</ref>\n\n[[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] returned to [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 14 September and in the following days the liberals had spread pamphlets (written by [[Joaquim Gon\u00e7alves Ledo]]) that suggested the idea that the Prince should be acclaimed [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional Emperor]].<ref name=\"Vianna, p.408\"/> On 17 September the President of the [[Municipal council|Municipal Chamber]] of Rio de Janeiro, Jos\u0117 Clemente Pereira, sent to the other Chambers of the country the news that the [[Acclamation]] would occur in the anniversary of Pedro on 12 October.<ref>Lustosa, p. 153</ref>\n[[File:Coroa\u00e7ao pedro I 001.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Coronation of Emperor Pedro I on December 1, 1822.]]\nThe official separation would only occur on 22 September 1822 in a letter written by Pedro to [[John VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]]. In it, Pedro still calls himself Prince Regent and his father is considered the King of the independent Brazil.<ref>Lima (1997), p. 379</ref><ref>Vianna, p. 413</ref> On 12 October 1822, in the Field of Santana (later known as Field of the Acclamation) Prince Pedro was acclaimed Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil. It was at the same time the beginning of Pedro's reign and also of the [[Empire of Brazil]].<ref>Vianna, pp. 417\u201318</ref> However, the Emperor made it clear that although he accepted the emperorship, if Jo\u00e3o VI returned to Brazil he would step down from the throne in favor of his father.<ref>Lima (1997), p. 404</ref>\n\nThe reason for the imperial title was that the title of king would symbolically mean a continuation of the Portuguese dynastic tradition and perhaps of the feared absolutism, while the title of emperor derived from popular acclamation as in [[Ancient Rome]] or at least reigning through popular sanction as in the case of Napoleon.<ref>Lima (1997), p.339</ref><ref>Barman (1999), p. 4; \"Some weeks later he was acclaimed emperor as Pedro I of Brazil.

The rest of Brazil remained firmly under the control of Portuguese juntas and garrisons.  It would take a war to put the whole of Brazil under Pedro's control.  The fighting began with skirmishes between rival militias in 1822 and lasted until January 1824, when the last Portuguese garrisons and naval units surrendered or left the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Imperial government had to create a regular [[Brazilian Army|Army]] and [[Brazilian Navy|Navy]].  Forced enlistment was widespread, extending to foreign immigrants, and Brazil made use of slaves in militias, as well as freeing slaves to enlist them in army and navy. The campaigns on land and sea covered the vast territories of [[Bahia]], [[Montevideo and Cisplatina]], Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1. [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Cear\u00e1]] and [[Piau\u00ed]].\n\nBy 1822, Brazilian forces were firmly in control of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the central area of Brazil.  Loyal militias began insurrections in the aforementioned territories, but strong, and regularly reinforced Portuguese garrisons in the port cities of  [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] and [[Bel\u00e9m]] continued to dominate the adjacent areas and to pose the threat of a reconquest that the irregular Brazilian militias and [[guerrilla]] forces, which were loosely besieging them by land supported by newly created units of the Brazilian army, would be unable to prevent.\n\nFor the Brazilians, the answer to this stalemate was to seize control of the sea.  Eleven former Portuguese warships, great and small, had fallen into Brazilian hands in Rio de Janeiro and these formed the basis of a new navy. The problem was manpower: the crews of these ships were largely Portuguese who were openly mutinous, and although many Portuguese naval officers had declared allegiance to Brazil their loyalty could not be relied on.  The Brazilian Government solved the problem by recruiting 50 officers and 500 seamen in secret in London and Liverpool, many of them veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, and appointed [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] as commander-in-chief.<ref>Brian Vale 'Independence or Death: British Sailors and Brazilian Independence' I B Tauris, 1995</ref>\nOn 1 April 1823, a Brazilian squadron of 6 ships sailed for Bahia.  After an initial disappointing engagement with a superior Portuguese fleet, Cochrane blockaded Salvador.  Deprived now of supplies and reinforcements by sea and besieged by the Brazilian army on land, on 2 July the Portuguese forces abandoned Bahia in a convoy of 90 ships.  Leaving the frigate \u2018Niteroi\u2019 under Captain John Taylor to harry them to the coasts of Europe, Cochrane then sailed north to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (Maranh\u00e3o).  There he tricked the Portuguese garrison into evacuating Maranh\u00e3o by pretending that a huge Brazilian fleet and army were over the  horizon.  He then sent Captain John Pascoe Grenfell to play the same trick on the Portuguese in Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 at the mouth of the Amazon.<ref>Brian Vale 'The Audacious Admiral Cochrane; The True Life of a Naval Legend',  Conway, 2004</ref>  By November 1823, the whole of the north of Brazil was under Brazilian control, and the following month, the demoralized Portuguese also evacuated Montevideo and the Cisplatine Province.  By 1824, Brazil was free of all enemy troops and was \u2018de facto\u2019 independent.<ref>Vale</ref>\n\nThere are still today no reliable [[statistics]]<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [[:pt:Laurentino Gomes|Laurentino Gomes]] [[1822 (book)|''1822'']] Nova Fronteira, Brasil 2010 {{ISBN|85-209-2409-3}} Chapter 10, p. 163</ref> related to the numbers of, for example, the total of the war casualties.

Formal recognition came with a treaty three years later, signed by both the new [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] in late 1825.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Landing of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Brazil, South America, 1500.]]\n\nThe land now called Brazil was claimed by the [[Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]] in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese naval fleet commanded by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]. The Portuguese encountered Indigenous nations divided into several tribes, most of whom shared the same [[Tupi\u2013Guarani languages]] family, and shared and disputed the territory. But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza killed tens of thousands{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThough the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization was effectively started in 1534 when [[John III of Portugal|King John III]] divided the territory into fifteen hereditary captaincies. This arrangement proved problematic, however, and in 1549 the king assigned a Governor-General to administer the entire colony. The Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes while others slowly disappeared in long wars or by [[Europe]]an diseases to which they had no immunity.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nBy the mid-16th century, [[sugar]] had become Brazil's most important export due to the increasing international demand for sugar. To profit from the situation, by 1700 over 963,000 African slaves had been brought across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to work in the plantations of Brazil. More Africans were brought to Brazil up until that date than to all the other places in [[Americas|The Americas]] ([[Western Hemisphere]]) combined.<ref>See the tables [http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces '''here'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027021745/http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces |date=2013-10-27 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 210\n | image1    = Departure of H.R.H. the Prince Regent of Portugal for the Brazils (Campaigns of the British Army in Portugal, London, 1812) - Henry L'Ev\u00eaque, F.

They sent military expeditions to the northwest of the [[South America]]n continent to the [[Amazon River]] basin rainforest and conquered competing [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] strongholds, founding villages and forts from 1669. In 1680 they reached the far southeast and founded [[Sacramento (Uruguay)|Sacramento]] on the bank of the [[Rio de la Plata]], in the ''[[Banda Oriental]]'' region (present-day [[Uruguay]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, sugar exports started to decline, but beginning in the 1690s, the discovery of gold by explorers in the region that would later be called [[Minas Gerais]] (General Mines) in current [[Mato Grosso]], [[Goi\u00e1s]] and the Brazilian state of [[Minas Gerais]] saved the colony from imminent collapse. From all over Brazil, as well as from Portugal, thousands of immigrants came to the mines in an early \"gold rush\".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] tried to prevent Portuguese expansion northwest, west, southwest and southeast into the territory that belonged to them according to the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] division of the [[New World]] of [[Americas|The Americas]] by the [[Bishop of Rome|Bishop and Pope of Rome]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1431-1503, reigned 1492-1503) and succeeded in conquering the ''Banda Oriental'' region in 1777.

This had the side effect of soon creating within Brazil, many of the institutions required to exist as an independent state; most importantly, it freed Brazil to trade with other nations at will.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter Napoleon's Imperial French army was finally defeated at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in June 1815, in order to maintain the capital in Brazil and allay Brazilian fears of being returned to colonial status, [[King John VI of Portugal]] raised the [[de jure]] status of Brazil to an equal, integral part of a new status in a [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]], rather than a mere colony, a status which it enjoyed for the next seven years, sending his son, Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] as prince regent.\n\n==Path to independence==\n===Portuguese ''Cortes''===\n[[File:Portuguese Cortes 1822.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Portuguese ''Cortes'']]\nIn 1820 the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|Constitutionalist Revolution]] erupted in [[Portugal]]. The movement initiated by the liberal constitutionalists resulted in the meeting of the ''[[Constituent Cortes of 1820|Cortes]]'' (or [[Constituent Assembly]]), that would have to create the kingdom's first [[constitution]].<ref>Lustosa, p.97</ref><ref>Armitage. p.36</ref> The ''Cortes'' at the same time demanded the return of King [[Don (honorific)|Dom]] [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], who had been living in [[Brazil]] since 1808, who elevated Brazil to a kingdom as part of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] in 1815 and who nominated his son and heir prince Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] as [[regent]], to govern Brazil in his place on 7 March 1821.<ref>Lustosa, p.106</ref><ref>Armitage. p. 38</ref> The king left for Europe on 26 April, while Dom Pedro remained in Brazil governing it with the aid of the ministers of the Kingdom (Interior) and Foreign Affairs, [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)|of War, of Navy]] and [[Ministry of Finance (Brazil)|of Finance]].<ref>Lustosa, pp. 109\u201310</ref><ref>Armitage. p. 41</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese military officers headquartered in Brazil were completely sympathetic to the Constitutionalist movement in Portugal.<ref>Lustosa, p. 112</ref> The main leader of the Portuguese officers, General [[Jorge de Avilez Zuzarte de Sousa Tavares]] forced the prince to dismiss and banish from the country the ministers of Kingdom and Finance. Both were loyal allies of Pedro, who had become a pawn in the hands of the military.<ref>Lustosa, pp. 113\u201314</ref> The humiliation suffered by the prince, who swore he would never yield to the pressure of the military again, would have a decisive influence on his abdication ten years later.<ref>Lustosa, p. 114</ref> Meanwhile, on 30 September 1821, the ''Cortes'' approved a decree that subordinated the governments of the [[Brazilian provinces]] directly to Portugal.

It was clear that independence was the only option left. Pedro turned to his companions that included his [[Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)|Guard of Honor]] and spoke: \"Friends, the Portuguese ''Cortes'' want to enslave and pursue us. From today on our relations are broken. No ties can unite us anymore\" and continued after he pulled out his blue-white armband that symbolized Portugal: \"Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to the independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil from Portugal!\" He unsheathed his sword affirming that \"For my blood, my honor, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom,\" and later cried out: \"Brazilians, Independence or death!\".

The Prince was received with great popular celebration and was called not only \"King of Brazil\", but also \"Emperor of Brazil\".<ref name=\"Vianna, p.408\">Vianna, p. 408</ref><ref>Lima (1997), p. 398</ref>\n\n[[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] returned to [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 14 September and in the following days the liberals had spread pamphlets (written by [[Joaquim Gon\u00e7alves Ledo]]) that suggested the idea that the Prince should be acclaimed [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional Emperor]].<ref name=\"Vianna, p.408\"/> On 17 September the President of the [[Municipal council|Municipal Chamber]] of Rio de Janeiro, Jos\u0117 Clemente Pereira, sent to the other Chambers of the country the news that the [[Acclamation]] would occur in the anniversary of Pedro on 12 October.<ref>Lustosa, p. 153</ref>\n[[File:Coroa\u00e7ao pedro I 001.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Coronation of Emperor Pedro I on December 1, 1822.]]\nThe official separation would only occur on 22 September 1822 in a letter written by Pedro to [[John VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]]. In it, Pedro still calls himself Prince Regent and his father is considered the King of the independent Brazil.<ref>Lima (1997), p. 379</ref><ref>Vianna, p. 413</ref> On 12 October 1822, in the Field of Santana (later known as Field of the Acclamation) Prince Pedro was acclaimed Dom Pedro I, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil. It was at the same time the beginning of Pedro's reign and also of the [[Empire of Brazil]].<ref>Vianna, pp. 417\u201318</ref> However, the Emperor made it clear that although he accepted the emperorship, if Jo\u00e3o VI returned to Brazil he would step down from the throne in favor of his father.<ref>Lima (1997), p. 404</ref>\n\nThe reason for the imperial title was that the title of king would symbolically mean a continuation of the Portuguese dynastic tradition and perhaps of the feared absolutism, while the title of emperor derived from popular acclamation as in [[Ancient Rome]] or at least reigning through popular sanction as in the case of Napoleon.<ref>Lima (1997), p.339</ref><ref>Barman (1999), p. 4; \"Some weeks later he was acclaimed emperor as Pedro I of Brazil.

The rest of Brazil remained firmly under the control of Portuguese juntas and garrisons.  It would take a war to put the whole of Brazil under Pedro's control.  The fighting began with skirmishes between rival militias in 1822 and lasted until January 1824, when the last Portuguese garrisons and naval units surrendered or left the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Imperial government had to create a regular [[Brazilian Army|Army]] and [[Brazilian Navy|Navy]].  Forced enlistment was widespread, extending to foreign immigrants, and Brazil made use of slaves in militias, as well as freeing slaves to enlist them in army and navy. The campaigns on land and sea covered the vast territories of [[Bahia]], [[Montevideo and Cisplatina]], Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1. [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Cear\u00e1]] and [[Piau\u00ed]].\n\nBy 1822, Brazilian forces were firmly in control of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the central area of Brazil.  Loyal militias began insurrections in the aforementioned territories, but strong, and regularly reinforced Portuguese garrisons in the port cities of  [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] and [[Bel\u00e9m]] continued to dominate the adjacent areas and to pose the threat of a reconquest that the irregular Brazilian militias and [[guerrilla]] forces, which were loosely besieging them by land supported by newly created units of the Brazilian army, would be unable to prevent.\n\nFor the Brazilians, the answer to this stalemate was to seize control of the sea.  Eleven former Portuguese warships, great and small, had fallen into Brazilian hands in Rio de Janeiro and these formed the basis of a new navy. The problem was manpower: the crews of these ships were largely Portuguese who were openly mutinous, and although many Portuguese naval officers had declared allegiance to Brazil their loyalty could not be relied on.  The Brazilian Government solved the problem by recruiting 50 officers and 500 seamen in secret in London and Liverpool, many of them veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, and appointed [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] as commander-in-chief.<ref>Brian Vale 'Independence or Death: British Sailors and Brazilian Independence' I B Tauris, 1995</ref>\nOn 1 April 1823, a Brazilian squadron of 6 ships sailed for Bahia.  After an initial disappointing engagement with a superior Portuguese fleet, Cochrane blockaded Salvador.  Deprived now of supplies and reinforcements by sea and besieged by the Brazilian army on land, on 2 July the Portuguese forces abandoned Bahia in a convoy of 90 ships.  Leaving the frigate \u2018Niteroi\u2019 under Captain John Taylor to harry them to the coasts of Europe, Cochrane then sailed north to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (Maranh\u00e3o).  There he tricked the Portuguese garrison into evacuating Maranh\u00e3o by pretending that a huge Brazilian fleet and army were over the  horizon.  He then sent Captain John Pascoe Grenfell to play the same trick on the Portuguese in Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 at the mouth of the Amazon.<ref>Brian Vale 'The Audacious Admiral Cochrane; The True Life of a Naval Legend',  Conway, 2004</ref>  By November 1823, the whole of the north of Brazil was under Brazilian control, and the following month, the demoralized Portuguese also evacuated Montevideo and the Cisplatine Province.  By 1824, Brazil was free of all enemy troops and was \u2018de facto\u2019 independent.<ref>Vale</ref>\n\nThere are still today no reliable [[statistics]]<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [[:pt:Laurentino Gomes|Laurentino Gomes]] [[1822 (book)|''1822'']] Nova Fronteira, Brasil 2010 {{ISBN|85-209-2409-3}} Chapter 10, p. 163</ref> related to the numbers of, for example, the total of the war casualties.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of [[RSVP Movies]], Roy Kapur Films and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]] in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who was diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the love story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she has gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while Hindi dialogue writing was done by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same Severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Tanya and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection. \n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/|title=The Sky Is Pink||publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya\u2019s Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan\u2019s Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Development and writing===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.

The film was co-produced by [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]], [[Ronnie Screwvala]] and [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] under their production companies of [[RSVP Movies]], Roy Kapur Films and [[Purple Pebble Pictures]] in association with Ivanhoe Pictures. The film stars Chopra Jonas, [[Farhan Akhtar]], [[Zaira Wasim]], and [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]]. Based on the real life story of [[Aisha Chaudhary]] who was diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], the film tells the love story of her parents, Aditi and Niren, dealing with their daughter's illness.\n\nAditi Chaudhary approached Bose to make a film based on her daughter. Although intrigued by the story, Bose instead chose to depict the story of the couple from Aisha's point of view, focusing on their marriage and the effect of a child's illness on the lives of the parents and their relationship. Bose wrote the screenplay based on the details she has gathered through interviewing Aditi and Niren. Nilesh Maniyar wrote the additional screenplay while Hindi dialogue writing was done by [[Juhi Chaturvedi]]. Filming took place in Mumbai, London, Delhi and [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. [[Pritam]] composed the soundtrack and [[Gulzar]] wrote the lyrics for the songs.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[44th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2019. It was released worldwide on 11 October 2019. ''The Sky Is Pink'' received generally positive reviews, with praise directed towards Bose's writing and direction and the performances. It did not perform well at the box office, grossing {{INR}}34.41 crore worldwide. The film received three [[Filmfare Awards]] nominations: [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Chopra Jonas and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Wasim.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Aisha Chaudhary]] narrates the story of her parents, Moose (her mother) and Panda (her father) from [[afterlife]]. Aditi and Niren are a young couple who come from two different backgrounds. Aditi is from the posh end of the town, [[South Delhi]], where on another hand Niren is from a grounded middle-class family. The couple are shown to be in love, with \"an active sex life\" as Aisha's narration describes. The passionate and happy couple get married, and Aditi becomes pregnant with their first child Tanya, who dies within months of her birth due to the [[Severe combined immunodeficiency]] condition. Baby Tanya used to frequently become ill and, while Aditi was convinced it was a serious issue, Niren used to brush it off. Niren believed that negligence was the reason Tanya couldn't be treated sooner and blamed himself for the death of his child. As Aditi was mourning the death of her child, she was consoled by a Catholic church nun and decided to be baptised.\n\nAditi and Niren have a second child Ishaan. A few years later, Aditi bore their third child, another daughter, Aisha. They later learn that Aisha was born with the same Severe combined immunodeficiency condition as their first child, Tanya and Niren are heartbroken. After the doctors in Delhi give up on the treatment, the couple go to London where they learn that the disease could be treated by performing [[bone marrow transplant]]. However, they learn that the treatment is very costly. Niren starts working to earn the money while also asking for crowdfunding via a radio station. After several weeks, they learn that several people have donated money for Aisha's treatment. The surgery is successful but Aisha is kept under doctor's watch. Aditi decides to stay in London while Niren goes back to India with his family and his son Ishaan. Aditi grows overprotective of Aisha, over cleaning the apartment and other things to keep Aisha away from any potential infection. \n\nIshaan starts missing his mother while Niren is always thinking about Aditi and Aisha. This also starts affecting Aditi and Niren's relationship as Aditi is always occupied with Aisha and taking care of her. Months go by and Niren goes to London and asks Aditi to move back to India so that their relationship is not affected. He reasons with Aisha on the grounds that Aisha had gotten better and occasional doctor's visit can be done in India as well. Aditi tells him that they have to live here for a very long time as per doctor's recommendation till Aisha's condition is cured. The whole family moves here permanently till Aisha is cured. Niren's career grows in London and he becomes rich and their family becomes affluent.\n\nSeveral years later, Aisha has finally gotten better and Niren and Aditi decide to move back to India with their families. They shift to the outskirts of Delhi and buy an extravagant and massive bungalow. After a doctor's visit, Aditi and Niren learn that Aisha has been diagnosed with [[pulmonary fibrosis]], a side effect of the chemotherapy that was done to cure the previous disease. With less time on Aisha's life, Aditi sets out to fulfill all of Aisha's dreams such as adopting a pet (which Aditi did not allow due to the risk of infection), seeing the aquatic life and writing a book, among other things. As Aisha's condition worsens, Aditi grows more and more overprotective and due to over stress, suffers a psychotic breakdown and is hospitalized. Aditi does everything in her power to make sure Aisha gets to see the first copy of her book before she dies. Later, Aisha passes away.\n\nAfter the death of Aisha, Aditi and Niren's relationship is strained. While living together, they grow apart and are constantly fighting with each other. Aditi still cannot accept Aisha's death and constantly brings her in their fights. At a party, Niren shows Aisha's secret video that he had found, a video she had made about her parents. Niren wants Aditi to move with him to London so that she can forget Aisha which she finds insulting as she does not want to let Aisha's memories fade, particularly the house. With anger, Niren leaves for London while Aditi stays back. Aditi later goes to meet Niren in London and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast has been listed below:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/the-sky-is-pink/cast/|title=The Sky Is Pink||publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra Jonas]] as Aditi Chaudhary\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Niren Chaudhary\n* [[Zaira Wasim]] as [[Aisha Chaudhary]]\n* [[Rohit Suresh Saraf]] as Ishaan Chaudhary\n* Vidhaan Sharma as Young Ishaan\n* Manas Mittal as Anshu Tandon\n* Rajshri Deshpande as Anita Tandon\n* Lushin Dubey as Mrs. Tandon\n* Sunil Chitkara as Mr. Chaudhary\n* Nirupama Verma as Mrs. Chaudhary\n* Puja Sarup as Mohini\n* Gurpal Singh as Rj Arjun Gill\n* Sheena Khalid as Rita\n* Sudhanva Deshpande as Dr. Nirvick Gulati\n* Manisha Chudasama as Santoshi\n* Paras Rattan Sharda as Jeet\n* Salmin Sheriff as Dr. Batliwala\n* Rishi Deshpande as Tanya\u2019s Doctor\n* Virhi as Baby Tanya\n* Mala Hashmi as Christian Woman\n* Akshay Joshi as Store Assistant\n* Nargis Nandal as Pilot\n* Raabia Marici as Ishaan\u2019s Girlfriend\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Development and writing===\nThe production of the film started when [[Aisha Chaudhary]]'s mother Aditi approached [[Shonali Bose]] to make a film about her daughter.
