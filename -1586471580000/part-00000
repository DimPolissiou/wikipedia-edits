The character was created by an unknown writer and [[penciler]]-[[inker]] [[John Romita Sr.]], who the following decade would become one of [[Spider-Man]]'s signature artists. The feature, drawn exclusively by Romita, ran through issue #17 (Aug. 1957), with cover art by Romita, [[Joe Maneely]], [[John Severin]], and, for one cover each, [[Carl Burgos]], [[Russ Heath]], and [[Syd Shores]].<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/search.lasso?type=character&query=western+kid&sort=chrono&Submit=Search/ The Western Kid] (character) at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\nThe character resurfaced as the lead feature of the omnibus title ''[[Gunsmoke Western]]'' #51 (March 1959), in a story written by Atlas/Marvel editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] and drawn by [[Dick Ayers]].<ref name=gcd />\n\nWestern Kid reprints appeared in Marvel's 1970s omnibus series ''[[Western Gunfighters]]'' #3-6 and 17-33 (Dec.1970 - Sept. 1971, Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1975). In-between, the character starred in the reprint series ''The Western Kid'' vol. 2, #1-5 (Dec. 1971 - Aug. 1972) &mdash; the first issue of which sported a new cover by original artist Romita &mdash; and in ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'' #105 (Nov. 1972) and ''Gun-Slinger'' #1-3 (Jan.-June 1973), a series reflecting the character's temporary new name. The first issue, with a cover drawn by [[Jim Steranko]], was titled ''Tex Dawson, Gun-Slinger''.<ref name=gcd />\n\nThe character returned in ''[[Apache Skies]]'' (2002), a four-issue [[miniseries]] starring the [[Rawhide Kid]] and two persons called the Apache Kid: Dazii Aloysius Kare, and his wife, Rosa.

Unlike such fellow Atlas Western stars as [[Kid Colt]] and the [[Rawhide Kid]], he was not hunted by the law for a perceived crime, and unlike the [[Two-Gun Kid]] or the [[Outlaw Kid]], he wore no mask.

As a leading landowner in the south of the county, Lloyd emerged as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. This reflected the fact that the Powell family, with one short interval in the 1850s, had held the county seat since 1816 and their claim to the seat had been widely accepted by the landowners of the county.{{refn|In his article on the Cardiganshire election of 1865, widely regarded as the definitive account, Ieuan Gwynedd Jones makes no reference to Lloyd's refusal to oppose Powell in 1859 on the grounds that he did not wish to oppose another member of the landed gentry.{{sfn|Jones|1964}} The same reasons, presumably, explain Lloyd's temporary withdrawal in 1865|group= n}} The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies, Llandinam]] offered themselves as alternative Liberal candidates.

Unlike the European rabbit, they do not form social burrow systems, but compared with some other [[leporid]]s, they are extremely tolerant of other individuals in their vicinity.\n\nCottontails give birth to their kits in burrows vacated by other mammals.

It can only use its nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail turns the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws to enable eating is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant. The cottontail then lifts a paw to bend the branch and bring the food within reach.<ref>{{cite web |title=Small mammals |url=http://www.jeffersoncountytrails.org/news-signs/SmallMammals2OCT11.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Thermoregulation ===\nDue to the variable temperature of living conditions, desert cottontails must be adequate [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulators]] to minimize water loss during the hotter seasons and require shaded areas of their environment to conduct evaporative water loss through thermal heat transfer. In open-desert areas, they can withstand for a short period with extremely high temperatures of around  45&nbsp;\u00b0C and have a large evaporative water loss capacity of around 1.5% body mass/hour, though cottontails can withstand longer in an ideal environment with shaded areas. To cope with evaporative heat loss, they do panting and undergo changes in production of their basal metabolic rate in relation to the ambient temperature of the environment. Ears of desert cottontails make up 14% of their body size and may help with thermoregulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hinds|first=David S.|date=August 1973|title=Acclimatization of Thermoregulation in the Desert Cottontail, Sylvilagus audubonii|jstor=1378969|journal=American Society of Mammalogists|volume=54|issue=3|pages=708\u2013728}}</ref>\n\n===  Predators and threats ===\n\n[[File:What's Up Doc.jpg|thumb|left|[[High Desert (California)|California High Desert]] cottontail on alert for predators]]\n\nMany desert animals prey on cottontails, including [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[mustelid]]s, the [[coyote]], the [[bobcat]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[mountain lion]]s, [[snake]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[human]]s, and even [[squirrel]]s, should a cottontail be injured or docile from illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/rabbit/eastern-cottontail.asp |title=Eastern Cottontail |access-date=2013-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129223018/http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/rabbit/eastern-cottontail.asp |archive-date=2013-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alien species, such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, are also known predators, and also pose a threat.<ref name=\":0\" /> Southwestern [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] hunted them for meat but also used their fur and hides.

Unlike the European rabbit, they do not form social burrow systems, but compared with some other [[leporid]]s, they are extremely tolerant of other individuals in their vicinity.\n\nCottontails give birth to their kits in burrows vacated by other mammals. They sometimes cool off, or take refuge in scratched out shallow created depressions of their own making, using their front paws like a back hoe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/cotton/|title=Desert Cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii)|website=tpwd.texas.gov|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611100626/http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/cotton/|archive-date=2017-06-11|url-status=|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref> They are not usually active in the middle of the day, but can be observed foraging in the early morning, and early evening. Cottontails are rarely found out of their burrows looking for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their ability to hear approaching predators, their primary defense mechanism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/rabbit-info2.htm |title=Rabbits and Hares |access-date=2015-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731024801/http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/rabbit-info2.htm |archive-date=2015-07-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe dental formula for ''Sylvilagus audubonii'' is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.0.3.3|lower=1.0.3.3}}= 28.<ref name=\":1\" /> All species under the family Leporidae have the same dental formula.\n\n==Lifespan==\n[[File:Cottontail age comparison-2.jpg|thumb|left|Male desert cottontail at 8 weeks, and the same specimen at 16 months of age]]\n[[File:Desert Cottontail on hind legs begging.jpg|thumb|Submissive posture anticipating food]]\n\nThe lifespan of a cottontail that reaches adulthood averages less than two years, depending on the location.<ref>{{cite web |title=Desert cottontail |url=http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/sylvaudu.htm |publisher=Natural Science Research Laboratory, Museum of Texas Tech University |accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref> Unfortunately for the cottontail, almost every local [[carnivore]] larger or faster than the [[Lagomorpha|lagomorph]] is its predator. Some predators, like [[snake]]s for example, are familiar with the area inhabited by the cottontails, and can catch and eat the young at will; the mother is unable to defend the litter. Although cottontails are highly active sexually, and mated pairs have multiple litters throughout the year, few young survive to adulthood. Those that survive grow quickly and are full grown at three months.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sylvilagus floridanus |url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/nkbiology/naturetrail/speciespages/cottontail.htm |date=2002}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe desert cottontail is quite similar in appearance to the [[European rabbit]], though its ears are larger and are more often carried erect.

etc.).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turkowski|first=Frank J.|date=October 1975|title=Dietary Adaptability of the Desert Cottontail|jstor=3800237|journal=The Journal of Wildlife

nutrients as effectively as possible.<ref name=\"NDOW\" />\n\nThe desert cottontail, like all cottontails, eats on all fours. It can only use its nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail turns the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws to enable eating is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant. The cottontail then lifts a paw to bend the branch and bring the food within reach.<ref>{{cite web |title=Small mammals |url=http://www.jeffersoncountytrails.org/news-signs/SmallMammals2OCT11.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Thermoregulation ===\nDue to the variable temperature of living conditions, desert cottontails must be adequate [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulators]] to minimize water loss during the hotter seasons and require shaded areas of their environment to conduct evaporative water loss through thermal heat transfer. In open-desert areas, they can withstand for a short period with extremely high temperatures of around  45&nbsp;\u00b0C and have a large evaporative water loss capacity of around 1.5% body mass/hour, though cottontails can withstand longer in an ideal environment with shaded areas. To cope with evaporative heat loss, they do panting and undergo changes in production of their basal metabolic rate in relation to the ambient temperature of the environment. Ears of desert cottontails make up 14% of their body size and may help with thermoregulation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hinds|first=David S.|date=August 1973|title=Acclimatization of Thermoregulation in the Desert Cottontail, Sylvilagus audubonii|jstor=1378969|journal=American Society of Mammalogists|volume=54|issue=3|pages=708\u2013728}}</ref>\n\n===  Predators and threats ===\n\n[[File:What's Up Doc.jpg|thumb|left|[[High Desert (California)|California High Desert]] cottontail on alert for predators]]\n\nMany desert animals prey on cottontails, including [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[mustelid]]s, the [[coyote]], the [[bobcat]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[mountain lion]]s, [[snake]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[human]]s, and even [[squirrel]]s, should a cottontail be injured or docile from illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/rabbit/eastern-cottontail.asp |title=Eastern Cottontail |access-date=2013-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129223018/http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/rabbit/eastern-cottontail.asp |archive-date=2013-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Alien species, such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, are also known predators, and also pose a threat.<ref name=\":0\" /> Southwestern [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] hunted them for meat but also used their fur and hides.
