This prolific manufacturer had more to do with bringing the Arts and Crafts style to the masses than any other.\n\nIn later years Harris Lebus became a household name being the largest furniture manufacturer in the world.<ref name=\":pdf\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.haringey.gov.uk/investigating__the_past_-_the_harris_lebus_factory.pdf |title=Investigating the Past: the Harris Lebus Factory |access-date=2008-07-29 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110304183809/https://www.haringey.gov.uk/investigating__the_past_-_the_harris_lebus_factory.pdf |archive-date=2011-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  \n\nDuring the Second World War the firm produced the [[Airspeed Horsa]] glider,<ref>[http://www.assaultgliderproject.co.uk/ The Assault Glider Trust]</ref>  the [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] multi role aircraft. The firm also undertook Top-secret operations, such as building replica [[Sherman tank]]s out of wood.<ref name=\":pdf\" />\n\nFollowing the war the firm became part of the government scheme to produce [[utility furniture]] bearing the [[CC41]] mark and were central in providing cheaper manufacturing techniques to provide the country with lower cost furniture with which they could rebuild their homes, and in fact their design team invented and patented the technique of facing man-made boards with other woods.<ref>[http://www.directorypatent.com/GB/1063765-a.html United Kingdom Patent GB1063765]</ref>The Company also devised and perfected the means of assembling Furniture from preformed sections and completing the construction by curing resin glue lines, utilising 'Radio Frequency' electricity, or 'R.F.' There was no metal fixing required in the assembly at all.\n\nAfter financial difficulty, caused by a period of poor management which was not Family, the firm finally closed in 1969; however some could say that the techniques developed at Lebus have caused the revolution in manufactured panels in home furnishing and flat pack that many of their counterparts use today.\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.harrislebus.com Harris Lebus local history website]\n\n[[Category:Arts and Crafts Movement]]\n[[Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:English furniture designers]]\n[[Category:Furniture companies of England]]\n[[Category:British furniture makers]]\n\n\n{{UK-manufacturing-company-stub}}\n", "name_user": "BFP1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Lebus"}

{"title_page": "Nutrient", "text_new": "{{short description|Substance that an organism uses to live}}\n{{redirects|Nutrients|nutrition in humans|Human nutrition|nutrition in animals|Animal nutrition|nutrition in plants|Plant nutrition|the journal|Nutrients (journal)}}\nA '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\n\nDifferent types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.\n\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.<ref name=\"Ensminger1994\">{{cite book|author=Audrey H.

Water must be also consumed in large quantities.\n* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nMacronutrients provide energy:\n\n* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).\n* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.\n* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.\n\nFat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Micronutrients===\nMicronutrients support metabolism.\n\n* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron.

The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.\n\n====Minerals====\n{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}\nMinerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\n\nThe essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>).

The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\n\nDifferent types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.\n\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels.

Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.\n* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.\n\nFat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Micronutrients===\nMicronutrients support metabolism.\n\n* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron.

They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Floh\u00e9 R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145\u20131155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}</ref> vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B<sub>1</sub>), [[riboflavin]] (B<sub>2</sub>), [[niacin]] (B<sub>3</sub>), [[pantothenic acid]] (B<sub>5</sub>), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B<sub>7</sub>), [[folate]] (B<sub>9</sub>), and [[cobalamin]] (B<sub>12</sub>). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.\n\n====Minerals====\n{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}\nMinerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\n\nThe essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].\n\n===Conditionally essential nutrients===\nConditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.<ref name=\"Carver\" /> [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.<ref name=\"Carver\" />\n\n=== Non-essential nutrients ===\nNon-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health.

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

Some types of land claims include [[Aboriginal title|aboriginal land claims]], [[Territorial claims of Antarctica|Antarctic land claims]], and post-colonial land claims.\n\nLand claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like [[Western Sahara]] or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. \n\nIn the [[Colonialism|colonial]] times of the United States American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the [[de facto]] conditions:\n# claim without any action on the ground\n# claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground\n# claim with the claimant visiting the land\n# claim with claimant living on the land.\n\nToday, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be [[Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_and_tenure|obtained]] by making productive use of it.\n\n==Mining claim (United States)==\nA '''mining claim''' is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the [[California gold rush]] of 1849. In the absence of effective government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and chose to essentially adopt Mexican mining law then in effect in California. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group.\n\nThe US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of ''[[prior appropriation]]'', by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use.  Other applications of appropriation theory were the [[Homestead Act]], which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west.\n\nThe California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States.  The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the [[Mining Act of 1872]].  All land in the [[Public_domain_(land)|public domain]], that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed.  The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California [[California_Gold_Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]].\n\nThe concept was also used in other countries, for example during the [[Australian gold rushes]] which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The [[Oriental Claims]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are one example of this.\n\n===Staking a claim===\n[[File:Mining claim corner Blue Ribbon Mine Alaska.jpg|thumb|Corner post of the claim of the Blue Ribbon Mine in Alaska]]\n\nStaking a claim involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a \"prudent man\" (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.\n\nThere are four main types of mining claims: \n# Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) \n# Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), \n# Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) \n# Millsite (a maximum five acre site for processing ore) \n\nA mining claim always starts out as an unpatented claim. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A patented claim is one for which the federal government has issued a patent (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Claim jumping===\nA dispute when one party (a \"claim jumper\") attempts to seize the land on which another party has already made claim is known as \"claim jumping\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/claim-jumping|accessdate=Jan 21, 2019|title=Definition|website=dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gold placer claim]]\n* [[Indigenous land claims in Canada]]\n* [[Indigenous specific land claims in Canada]]\n* [[Land grant]] \n* [[Land rights]]\n* [[Land reform]]\n* [[Terra nullius]] (no man's land)\n* [[Guano Islands Act]]\n* [[Extraterrestrial real estate]]\n* [[Claim club]]\n* [[Land reform in South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geography terminology]]\n[[Category:Mining]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Legal declaration of desired control over an area}}\n[[File:Mining claim, South Yuba River (cropped).jpg|thumb|Claim at the [[Yuba River|South Yuba River]]]]\nA '''land claim''' is defined as \"the pursuit of recognized territorial ownership by a group or individual\".<ref>{{citeweb|title=Land Claims|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/land-claims|work=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims.
