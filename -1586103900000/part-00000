It has since gone on to professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and internationally.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe show opens with the six Queens performing an opening number in pop-concert, girl-group fashion introducing themselves. They also welcome the audience to the performance (\"Ex-Wives\"). They address the crowd and tell them that this show will feature a competition, and whoever had the \"biggest load of B.S.\" to deal with from the man who married them, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], will be the leader of the group (\"Ex-Wives (Reprise)\"). [[Catherine of Aragon]] starts off and recounts her marriage to Henry and later annulment, and almost being put into a nunnery when he began lusting after [[Anne Boleyn]] (\"No Way\"). When Aragon claims that she is the winner, the other Queens mention Anne and how she overlapped with Aragon during the former's marriage, resulting in said annulment (\"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\"), and Anne recounts her time as Queen with Henry and her eventual execution (\"Don't Lose Ur Head\"). She then continues to argue that she deserves to win the competition due to her execution and further begins to sing a new solo 'about the moment [she] found out Catherine of Aragon had tragically died'. This attempted solo is interrupted by the other queens. [[Jane Seymour]] then announces it's her turn to recount what she put up with, but the other Queens mock her for not having as much to deal with as, in her words, she was \"the only one he truly loved\". Jane admits that while she may have been lucky for not having to suffer at his hand, she still stood by him throughout all his faults (\"Heart of Stone\").\n\nThe story then shifts as the Queens are suddenly turned into members of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s painting studio, talking about how they make the women he paints look beautiful for their portraits (\"Haus of Holbein\"). In a set-up parodying [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] (or another similar dating site) they present three women: [[Christina of Denmark]], [[Amalia of Cleves]], and [[Anne of Cleves|Anna of Cleves]],{{efn|The character goes by the German spelling, 'Anna', instead of the traditionally anglicised, Anne.}} Amalia's elder sister. When Henry \"swipes right\", so to speak, on Anna, they all assume he will marry Anna and that they will have a happy, long-lasting marriage (\"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\"). Of course, their union is ultimately ill-fated as he rejects Anna, and she pretends to make a big deal about how she is then forced to live in a beautiful palace in Richmond as a result, though she's not really complaining. She then boasts about her riches and how since she remained unmarried after her divorce, there is no man around to tell her what to do, meaning she is able to do anything she pleases (\"Get Down\"). After the Queens point out how Anna's life doesn't sound that difficult, Anna says \"Oh, well, back to the palace\". As [[Catherine Howard|Katherine Howard]] is next to go, the Queens belittle her for being \"the least relevant Catherine\", but Katherine retaliates by mentioning flaws in the other Queens' reasons for winning, such as how Anne Boleyn wasn't the only beheaded wife and how Jane Seymour only died due to natural causes. She then recounts her life and the men who abused her, leading into her marriage to Henry as she breaks down, fully realizing the trauma she suffered from her relationships and how these \"all-powerful men\" led to her eventual beheading (\"All You Wanna Do\").\n\nAs the Queens continue to squabble about who should win the contest, a frustrated [[Catherine Parr]] puts a stop to it. Questioning the point of it all, she brings up the fact that they're remembered solely by their shared connection to Henry, not as individuals. When they refuse to listen, claiming she has no story to tell that involves Henry, Parr tells her story, and of the accomplishments she made independently of Henry (\"I Don't Need Your Love\"). The other Queens, realising that they've let themselves be defined by Henry for so long, stop the contest and declare that they don't need his love to feel validated as people (\"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\"). With only five minutes left in the show after the fact, they decide to use their remaining moments on stage to \"rewrite\" the stories they told and sing for themselves for a change, singing together as a group rather than as solo artists and writing their own [[Happy ending|happily ever after]] (\"Six\").\n\nIn all of the live performances of the show as of July 2018, the Queens perform an encore number that is not featured on the Original Cast Recording, which is a mashup of all the songs performed in the show (minus \"Haus of Holbein\") called \"Megasix\". The audience is encouraged by the Queens to film this portion of the performance \u2013 the exception is on all USA engagements of ''Six'' after the Chicago premiere due to union rules.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n* \"Ex-Wives\" \u2013 The Queens\n* \"Ex-Wives (Reprise/Playoff)\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n* \"No Way\" \u2013 Catherine of Aragon and Ensemble\n* \"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n* \"Don't Lose Ur Head\" \u2013 Anne Boleyn and Ensemble \n* \"Heart of Stone\" \u2013 Jane Seymour and Ensemble  \n* \"Haus of Holbein\" \u2013 Company\n* \"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\" \u2013 Company \u2020\n* \"Get Down\" \u2013 Anna of Cleves and Ensemble \n* \"All You Wanna Do\" \u2013 Katherine Howard and Ensemble \n* \"I Don't Need Your Love\" \u2013 Catherine Parr\n* \"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\" \u2013 Catherine Parr and the Queens \u2020\u2020\n* \"Six\" \u2013 The Queens\n* \"Megasix\" \u2013 The Queens \u2020\n\n\u2020 Not included on the Studio Cast Recording.<br />\n\u2020\u2020 Included as part of \"I Don't Need Your Love\" on the Studio Cast Recording.\n\n== Productions ==\n=== Writing and Edinburgh Fringe ===\nThe idea for the musical came to Toby Marlow while studying in his final year at Cambridge University, and despite uncertainties from collaborator Lucy Moss, the pair wrote part of the show while studying for their final exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/culture/theatre/six-the-musical-steps-from-fringe-to-the-west-end-1.469323|title=We wrote a musical during our finals...now it's on in the West End|website= The JC|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> Marlow had been selected in late 2016 by Cambridge University Arts Society to write a new musical to be performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and the initial six wives' concert concept came to him later during a poetry class when he decided to get his friend Moss involved.

Jones suggests the show could use 10 more minutes of material that gets away from the plot's singing contest conceit, and toward the emotional center of the characters. He also thinks the orchestration of the songs could be more substantial.  Jones believes ''Six'' has an audience that is ready for it, in part because it gets to a complex historical paradox and treats it with verve, the memories of women in history being tied to the life of a man.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-ent-six-chicago-shakes-review-ttd-0524-story.html |title=Now at Chicago Shakes, 'Six' gives these Tudor wives a voice and could be a huge hit |last=Jones |first=Chris |date=2019-05-23|work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> Hedy Weiss of ''WTTW'' praises the musical as \"sensational\", singling out each performer in the Chicago cast.

It has since gone on to professional productions in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and internationally.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe show opens with the six Queens performing an opening number in pop-concert, girl-group fashion introducing themselves. They also welcome the audience to the performance (\"Ex-Wives\"). They address the crowd and tell them that this show will feature a competition, and whoever had the \"biggest load of B.S.\" to deal with from the man who married them, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], will be the leader of the group (\"Ex-Wives (Reprise)\"). [[Catherine of Aragon]] starts off and recounts her marriage to Henry and later annulment, and almost being put into a nunnery when he began lusting after [[Anne Boleyn]] (\"No Way\"). When Aragon claims that she is the winner, the other Queens mention Anne and how she overlapped with Aragon during the former's marriage, resulting in said annulment (\"Anne Boleyn (Interlude)\"), and Anne recounts her time as Queen with Henry and her eventual execution (\"Don't Lose Ur Head\"). She then continues to argue that she deserves to win the competition due to her execution and further begins to sing a new solo 'about the moment [she] found out Catherine of Aragon had tragically died'. This attempted solo is interrupted by the other queens. [[Jane Seymour]] then announces it's her turn to recount what she put up with, but the other Queens mock her for not having as much to deal with as, in her words, she was \"the only one he truly loved\". Jane admits that while she may have been lucky for not having to suffer at his hand, she still stood by him throughout all his faults (\"Heart of Stone\").\n\nThe story then shifts as the Queens are suddenly turned into members of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s painting studio, talking about how they make the women he paints look beautiful for their portraits (\"Haus of Holbein\"). In a set-up parodying [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]] (or another similar dating site) they present three women: [[Christina of Denmark]], [[Amalia of Cleves]], and [[Anne of Cleves|Anna of Cleves]],{{efn|The character goes by the German spelling, 'Anna', instead of the traditionally anglicised, Anne.}} Amalia's elder sister. When Henry \"swipes right\", so to speak, on Anna, they all assume he will marry Anna and that they will have a happy, long-lasting marriage (\"Haus of Holbein (Playoff)\"). Of course, their union is ultimately ill-fated as he rejects Anna, and she pretends to make a big deal about how she is then forced to live in a beautiful palace in Richmond as a result, though she's not really complaining. She then boasts about her riches and how since she remained unmarried after her divorce, there is no man around to tell her what to do, meaning she is able to do anything she pleases (\"Get Down\"). After the Queens point out how Anna's life doesn't sound that difficult, Anna says \"Oh, well, back to the palace\". As [[Catherine Howard|Katherine Howard]] is next to go, the Queens belittle her for being \"the least relevant Catherine\", but Katherine retaliates by mentioning flaws in the other Queens' reasons for winning, such as how Anne Boleyn wasn't the only beheaded wife and how Jane Seymour only died due to natural causes. She then recounts her life and the men who abused her, leading into her marriage to Henry as she breaks down, fully realizing the trauma she suffered from her relationships and how these \"all-powerful men\" led to her eventual beheading (\"All You Wanna Do\").\n\nAs the Queens continue to squabble about who should win the contest, a frustrated [[Catherine Parr]] puts a stop to it. Questioning the point of it all, she brings up the fact that they're remembered solely by their shared connection to Henry, not as individuals. When they refuse to listen, claiming she has no story to tell that involves Henry, Parr tells her story, and of the accomplishments she made independently of Henry (\"I Don't Need Your Love\").
