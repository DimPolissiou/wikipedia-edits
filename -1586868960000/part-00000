{"title_page": "GNSS applications", "text_new": "{{broader|Satellite navigation}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2018}}\n[[Satellite navigation|Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) receivers, using the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] or [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]]<!-- Don't include Galileo here, as it is not yet operational --> system, are used in many applications. The first systems were developed in the 20th century, mainly to help military personnel find their way, but [[location awareness]] soon found many civilian applications.\n\n==Navigation ==\n*[[Automobile]]s can be equipped with GNSS receivers at the factory or as [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] equipment.  Units often display moving maps and information about location, speed, direction, and nearby streets and [[point of interest|points of interest]].\n{{main|Automotive navigation system}}\n[[File:GPS Receiver.JPG|thumb|A GPS receiver in civilian automobile use.]]\n\n*[[Air navigation]] systems usually have a [[moving map display]] and are often connected to the [[autopilot]] for en-route navigation.  Cockpit-mounted GNSS receivers and [[glass cockpit]]s are appearing in [[general aviation]] aircraft of all sizes, using technologies such as [[WAAS]] or [[Local Area Augmentation System|LAAS]] to increase accuracy.  Many are certified for [[instrument flight rules]] navigation, and some can also be used for final approach and landing operations as in [[Joint precision approach and landing system]].  [[Glider aircraft|Glider]] pilots use [[GNSS Flight Recorders]] to log GNSS data verifying their arrival at turn points in [[gliding competition]]s, and for information to aid en route decision making for cross-country [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]].\n*[[Boat]]s and [[ship]]s can use GNSS to navigate all of the world's lakes, seas and oceans.  Maritime GNSS units include functions useful on water, such as \"man overboard\" (MOB) functions that allow instantly marking the location where a person has fallen overboard, which simplifies rescue efforts.  GNSS may be connected to the ships [[self-steering gear]] and [[Chartplotter]]s using the [[NMEA 0183]] interface. GNSS can also improve the security of shipping traffic by enabling [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]].\n[[Image:GPS navigating home.jpg|right|thumb|A GPS unit showing basic way point and tracking information which is typically required for outdoor sport and recreational use]]\n*Heavy equipment can use GNSS in construction, mining and [[precision agriculture]].  The blades and buckets of [[construction equipment]] are controlled automatically in GNSS-based [[machine guidance]] systems.  [[Agricultural equipment]] may use GNSS to steer automatically, or as a visual aid displayed on a screen for the driver.  This is useful for controlled traffic and [[row crop]] operations and when spraying.  Harvesters with yield monitors can also use GNSS to create a yield map of the [[paddock]] being harvested.\n*[[Cycling|Cyclists]] often use GNSS in racing and touring.  GNSS navigation allows cyclists to plot their course in advance and follow this course, which may include quieter, narrower streets, without having to stop frequently to refer to separate maps.  GNSS receivers designed specifically for cycling may include sophisticated 'street-aware' mapping features, or may be oriented towards recording the progress of the cyclist along the route. This data can be reviewed after the ride to inform the rider's training or competition planning, or uploaded to online services which allow riders to view and compare each other's rides.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://road.cc/content/buyers-guide/175875-19-best-smartphone-cycling-apps-iphone-and-android|title=19 of the best smartphone cycling apps for iPhone and Android|date=2016-01-16|website=road.cc|access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref>\n*[[Hiking|Hikers]], [[mountain climbing|climbers]], and even ordinary pedestrians in urban or rural environments can use GNSS to determine their position, with or without reference to separate maps.  In isolated areas, the ability of GNSS to provide a precise position can greatly enhance the chances of rescue when climbers or hikers are disabled or lost (if they have a means of communication with rescue workers).\n*[[GPS for the visually impaired|GNSS equipment for the visually impaired]] is available.\n*[[Spacecraft]] are beginning to use GNSS as a navigational tool. The addition of a GNSS receiver to a spacecraft allows precise orbit determination without ground tracking. This, in turn, enables autonomous spacecraft navigation, formation flying, and autonomous rendezvous. The use of GNSS in MEO, GEO, HEO, and highly elliptical orbits is feasible only if the receiver can acquire and track the much weaker (15 - 20&nbsp;dB) GNSS side-lobe signals. This design constraint, and the radiation environment found in space, prevents the use of [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] receivers. It is easier for [[Low earth orbit]] satellites to use GNSS.

This allows positioning errors on the order of one meter or less in real-time, with a differential GNSS signal received using a separate radio receiver. By storing the carrier phase measurements and differentially [[Differential GPS post-processing|post-processing]] the data, positioning errors on the order of 10 centimeters are possible with these receivers.\n**Several projects, including [[OpenStreetMap]] and [[TierraWiki]], allow users to create maps collaboratively, much like a [[wiki]], using consumer-grade GPS receivers.\n*Geophysics and geology \u2014 High precision measurements of [[crust (geology)|crustal]] strain can be made with differential GNSS by finding the relative displacement between GNSS sensors.  Multiple stations situated around an actively deforming area (such as a [[volcano]] or [[fault zone]]) can be used to find strain and ground movement. These measurements can then be used to interpret the cause of the [[Deformation Monitoring|deformation]], such as a dike or sill beneath the surface of an active volcano.\n*[[Archaeology]] \u2014 As archaeologists excavate a site, they generally make a three-dimensional map of the site, detailing where each artifact is found.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cobb |first1=Peter J. |last2=Earley-Spadoni|first2=Tiffany |last3=Dames|first3=Philip |title=Centimeter-Level Recording for All: Field Experimentation with New, Affordable Geolocation Technology |journal=Advances in Archaeological Practice |date=2019  |doi=10.1017/aap.2019.21|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n*[[Surveying]] \u2014 Survey-Grade GNSS receivers can be used to position [[survey marker]]s, buildings, and [[road construction]]. These units use the signal from both the L1 and L2 GPS frequencies.  Even though the L2 code data are [[encrypted]], the signal's [[carrier wave]] enables correction of some [[Ionospheric delay|ionospheric errors]].  These dual-frequency GPS receivers typically cost US$10,000 or more, but can have positioning errors on the order of one centimetre or less when used in carrier phase [[differential GPS]] mode.\n*Survey-grade [[GNSS]] [[Receiver (modulated ultrasound)|receiver]] [[industry]] include a relatively small number of major players who specialize in the design of complex dual-frequency [[GNSS]] [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] capable of precise tracking of carrier phases for all or most of available signals in order to bring the accuracy of relative [[positioning (telecommunications)|positioning]] down to cm-level values required by these applications. The most known companies are Javad, [[Leica Geosystems|Leica]], [[NovAtel]], [[Septentrio]], [[Topcon Positioning System|Topcon]] and [[Trimble Navigation|Trimble]].\n\n== Other uses ==\n* Military [[guided munitions|precision-guided munitions]] \u2013 Many types of munitions, including [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM bombs]], [[M982 Excalibur|Excalibur 155&nbsp;mm artillery shell]], use GNSS to guide them to their target.\n* Precise time reference \u2013 Many systems that must be accurately [[synchronization|synchronized]] use GNSS as a source of accurate time. GNSS can be used as a [[Radio clock|reference clock]] for [[time code]] generators or [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) [[time server]]s. [[Sensor]]s (for [[seismology]] or other monitoring application) can use GNSS as a precise time source. [[Time-division multiple access]] (TDMA) communications networks often rely on this precise timing to synchronize RF generating equipment, network equipment, and [[multiplexer]]s.\n* Mobile satellite communications \u2013 [[Satellite communications]] systems use a directional antenna (usually a \"dish\") pointed at a satellite. The antenna on a moving ship or train, for example, must be pointed based on its current location. Modern antenna controllers usually incorporate a GNSS receiver to provide this information.\n* [[E911|Emergency]] and [[location-based service]]s \u2013 GNSS functionality can be used by [[emergency services]] to locate cell phones.  The ability to locate a mobile phone is required in the United States by [[E911]] emergency services legislation.  However, such a system is not in place everywhere.  GNSS is less dependent on the telecommunications network [[topology]] than [[radiolocation]] for compatible phones.  [[Assisted GPS]] reduces the power requirements of the mobile phone and increases the accuracy of the location.  A phone's geographic location may also be used to provide location-based services, including advertising or other location-specific information.\n** [[Location-based game]]s \u2013 The availability of hand-held GNSS receivers has led to games such as [[geocaching]], which involves using a hand-held GNSS unit to travel to a specific [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] to search for objects hidden by other geocachers. This popular activity often includes walking or hiking to natural locations.  [[Geodashing]] is an outdoor sport using [[waypoint]]s.\n** [[Marketing]] \u2013 Some market research companies have combined GIS systems and survey-based research to help companies to decide where to open new branches and to target their advertising according to the usage patterns of roads and the socio-demographic attributes of residential zones.\n*Aircraft passengers \u2013 Most [[airline]]s allow passenger use of GNSS units on their flights, except during landing and take-off, when other electronic devices are also restricted. Even though consumer GNSS receivers have a minimal risk of interference, a few airlines disallow use of hand-held receivers during flight.  Other airlines integrate aircraft tracking into the seat-back television entertainment system, available to all passengers even during takeoff and landing.<ref>Joe Mehaffey.

A \"GNSS compass\" uses a pair of antennas separated by about 50&nbsp;cm to detect the phase difference in the carrier signal from a particular GNSS satellite.<ref>[http://www.jrcamerica.com/product.asp?Product_Id=17778 ''JLR-10 GPS Compass''].

More expensive GNSS compass systems use three antennas in a triangle to get three separate readings with respect to each satellite.  A GNSS compass is not subject to [[magnetic declination]] as a magnetic compass is and does not need to be reset periodically like a [[gyrocompass]]. It is, however, subject to multipath effects.\n* [[GPS tracking]] systems use GNSS to determine the location of a vehicle, person, pet or freight, and to record the position at regular intervals in order to create a log of movements.  The data can be stored inside the unit or sent to a remote computer by radio or cellular modem.  Some systems allow the location to be viewed in real time on the Internet with a web browser.\n** Monitoring the whereabouts of convicted [[sex offender]]s, using a GPS anklet as a condition of parole. Law-enforcement officials can review the daily movements of offenders for a cost of only $5 or $10 per day.

The first systems were developed in the 20th century, mainly to help military personnel find their way, but [[location awareness]] soon found many civilian applications.\n\n==Navigation ==\n*[[Automobile]]s can be equipped with GNSS receivers at the factory or as [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] equipment.  Units often display moving maps and information about location, speed, direction, and nearby streets and [[point of interest|points of interest]].\n{{main|Automotive navigation system}}\n[[File:GPS Receiver.JPG|thumb|A GPS receiver in civilian automobile use.]]\n\n*[[Air navigation]] systems usually have a [[moving map display]] and are often connected to the [[autopilot]] for en-route navigation.  Cockpit-mounted GNSS receivers and [[glass cockpit]]s are appearing in [[general aviation]] aircraft of all sizes, using technologies such as [[WAAS]] or [[Local Area Augmentation System|LAAS]] to increase accuracy.  Many are certified for [[instrument flight rules]] navigation, and some can also be used for final approach and landing operations as in [[Joint precision approach and landing system]].  [[Glider aircraft|Glider]] pilots use [[GNSS Flight Recorders]] to log GNSS data verifying their arrival at turn points in [[gliding competition]]s, and for information to aid en route decision making for cross-country [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]].\n*[[Boat]]s and [[ship]]s can use GNSS to navigate all of the world's lakes, seas and oceans.  Maritime GNSS units include functions useful on water, such as \"man overboard\" (MOB) functions that allow instantly marking the location where a person has fallen overboard, which simplifies rescue efforts.  GNSS may be connected to the ships [[self-steering gear]] and [[Chartplotter]]s using the [[NMEA 0183]] interface. GNSS can also improve the security of shipping traffic by enabling [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]].\n[[Image:GPS navigating home.jpg|right|thumb|A GPS unit showing basic way point and tracking information which is typically required for outdoor sport and recreational use]]\n*Heavy equipment can use GNSS in construction, mining and [[precision agriculture]].  The blades and buckets of [[construction equipment]] are controlled automatically in GNSS-based [[machine guidance]] systems.  [[Agricultural equipment]] may use GNSS to steer automatically, or as a visual aid displayed on a screen for the driver.  This is useful for controlled traffic and [[row crop]] operations and when spraying.  Harvesters with yield monitors can also use GNSS to create a yield map of the [[paddock]] being harvested.\n*[[Cycling|Cyclists]] often use GNSS in racing and touring.  GNSS navigation allows cyclists to plot their course in advance and follow this course, which may include quieter, narrower streets, without having to stop frequently to refer to separate maps.  GNSS receivers designed specifically for cycling may include sophisticated 'street-aware' mapping features, or may be oriented towards recording the progress of the cyclist along the route. This data can be reviewed after the ride to inform the rider's training or competition planning, or uploaded to online services which allow riders to view and compare each other's rides.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://road.cc/content/buyers-guide/175875-19-best-smartphone-cycling-apps-iphone-and-android|title=19 of the best smartphone cycling apps for iPhone and Android|date=2016-01-16|website=road.cc|access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref>\n*[[Hiking|Hikers]], [[mountain climbing|climbers]], and even ordinary pedestrians in urban or rural environments can use GNSS to determine their position, with or without reference to separate maps.

They took the form of a \"Letter of Request\" from the [[Governor General of Canada]]. These documents remained in use until, in 1915, Canadian passports were first issued in the British format, a ten section single sheet folder.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Jonathan|title=A History of Migration from Germany to Canada, 1850\u20131939|publisher=UBC Press|year=2006|page=163|isbn=978-0-7748-1216-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awZGrPonfSMC&pg=PA163&dq=%22in+1915+canada+abandoned+its+single-sheet+form%22&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22in%201915%20canada%20abandoned%20its%20single-sheet%20form%22&f=false|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe modern form of the Canadian passport came about in 1921. At that time, Canadians were [[British subject]]s, and Canada shared a common nationality with the United Kingdom; thus, Canadian passports were issued to those British subjects resident in or connected to Canada. This arrangement ended in 1947, when the [[Canadian Citizenship Act]] was granted [[Royal Assent]] and the designation of [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizenship]] was created. Beginning in July the following year, Canadian passports were issued to Canadian citizens only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immigroup.com/news/history-canadian-passports| title=THE HISTORY OF CANADIAN PASSPORTS| publisher=IMMIgroup| date=12 April 2013| accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1947 and 1970, Canadian citizens could only apply for passports by mail to Ottawa. Requirements were simple, and applicants claiming birth in Canada did not have to provide proof of birth. The lax security has led to numerous cases of misuse of the passport, so the Canadian Government tightened the application requirements from 1970. That year, the first three Passport Canada offices were opened in [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"INFO\" />\n\nIn 1985, the first version of machine-readable passports (MRP) was issued, in accordance with [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] standards. An amended version came into circulation in 1991, with additional security features and more stringent processing requirements. By 1993, a newer version of MRP was introduced, which contained unique features to prevent replication or alteration.<ref name=\"INFO\" />\n\nSince 11 December 2001, children have not been included in parents' passports, and passports have been issued for one person only.<ref name=\"cbsa\" />\n\nIn 2002, Passport Canada began to issue an updated version within Canada, which includes the digitally printed photo of the bearer embedded into the identification page of the booklet, holographic images, bar-coded serial number, and a second hidden photo of the bearer that could only be viewed under ultraviolet light. Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006.<ref name=\"INFO\" /> In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of [[Optically Variable Ink]] and addition of laser perforated number. The cover, watermark, personalisation technique and holographic laminate are same with the 2002 version. The 2010 version was also the last revision of MRP prior to the release of e-passports.<ref name=\"cbsa\" />\n\nIn the [[2008 Canadian federal budget|2008 federal budget]], [[Jim Flaherty]], Minister of Finance, announced that [[biometric passport]]s (\"e-passports\") would be introduced by 2011.<ref name=\"budget.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2008/pdf/plan-eng.pdf|title=Budget 2008: Responsible Leadership for Uncertain Times|publisher=}}</ref> A pilot project began in 2009, with e-passports being issued to special and diplomatic passport applicants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-diplomatic-and-special-passports-fact-file-1.2000076| title=Canadian diplomatic and special passports fact file| publisher=[[CTV Television Network]]| date=10 September 2014| accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> The e-passport roll-out was pushed back to 1 July 2013. On the same day, the issuing authority of Canadian passports was shifted from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), now known as IRCC.<ref name=\"order\" />\n\n==Application and issuance==\n\n{{main|Canadian nationality law}}\nThe issuance of passports falls under the [[Royal Prerogative]]. They are issued, in the name of the reigning [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] (as expressed in the [[#Passport note|passport note]]), according to the ''Canadian Passport Order''.<ref name=\"order\">{{Cite canlaw|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-81-86/FullText.html|linkloc=|wikilink=|type=reg|regtitle=Canadian Passport Order|regnumber=SI/81-86}}.</ref> This [[Order in Council]] specifies grounds for which [[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] (IRCC) can issue or renew a passport.\n\n===Passport requirements===\nUnder the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', all Canadian citizens have the right to enter Canada. Since 10 November 2016, under the new [[visa policy of Canada|visa regulations]] all visa-free passport holders (except for U.S. citizens and nationals) are required to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) before boarding a flight to Canada. This means there is now a ''de facto'' requirement for Canadian citizens to use a Canadian passport when travelling to or transiting through Canada by air, unless a special authorization is obtained within 10 days of travel.\n\nAs the eTA is used for the sole purpose of immigration screening for non-Canadian visitors entering Canada on a temporary basis, all Canadian citizens are automatically barred from applying the eTA. Hence the passport requirement is in place, because a Canadian citizen who travels on a visa-free, non-Canadian passport will be prevented from boarding the commercial flight to Canada unless he or she can present a valid Canadian passport during check-in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/dual-canadian-citizens.asp|title=Dual Canadian citizens need a valid Canadian passport|first=Government of Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Communications|last=Branch|website=www.cic.gc.ca}}</ref> The only exceptions to this rule are for a Canadian citizen travelling on a U.S. passport, as Americans do not need an eTA to enter Canada, or when a Canadian citizen travelling on an eTA-required passport enters Canada by sea or through [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings|one of the land ports of entry from the U.S.]]\n\n===Application===\nCanadians in Canada can submit their applications in person through a passport office, a [[Service Canada]] location, or can submit their applications by mail. Canadians in the U.S. or Bermuda can apply only by mail. Canadians living in other countries or territories are required to apply through the nearest [[List of diplomatic missions of Canada|Canadian diplomatic posts]] abroad. Expedited services (urgent, express and standard pick-ups) are only available through a passport office in Canada.\n\n===Guarantor of identity===\nCanadian passport issuing system is modelled after the United Kingdom, where all first-time passport applications are required to be \"countersigned\" by a person who has known the applicant for a minimum of 2 years and if issued outside of Canada the guarantor may be someone who works in a recognised profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications/when-to-sign-what-to-do|title=Countersigning passport applications and photos: When you must get a signature and what to do - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref> Australia and New Zealand have similar policies. The use of a guarantor is to serve \"as a security measure in the entitlement process and as a point of departure for the future investigation of statements made on the application form\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/atip-aiprp/publications/guarantor_citizenship-repondants_citoyennete.aspx?lang=eng|title=Global Affairs Canada|first1=Global Affairs|last1=Canada|first2=Affaires mondiales|last2=Canada|date=26 June 2013|access-date=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325033949/http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/atip-aiprp/publications/guarantor_citizenship-repondants_citoyennete.aspx?lang=eng|archive-date=25 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRules regarding the eligibility of guarantors were last updated on 12 August 2013. For passport applicants in Canada, only a Canadian passport holder can be a guarantor. For Canadian citizens living abroad who do not have a Canadian guarantor, a non-Canadian guarantor who works in a licensed profession may be used for application, such as a dentist, medical doctor, judge, lawyer, notary public, pharmacist, police officer, veterinarian, or sitting officer for a financial institution.\n\n===Passport fees===\n\nThe fee (since 1 July 2013) for a standard adult passport issued in Canada is $120 for a five-year passport or $160 for a ten-year passport, and outside of Canada is $190 and $260 respectively. The fee for a five-year passport for a child under 16 is $57 if issued in Canada, and $100 outside of Canada.   Additional fees are levied for urgent service or replacement of a lost or stolen passport. All fees are payable in [[Canadian dollars]].\n\n===Refusal and revocation of passports===\nIRCC may revoke a passport or refuse to issue or renew a passport on grounds set out in the ''Canadian Passport Order'', including such grounds as failure to submit a complete application, misrepresentation in obtaining a passport, and criminality. However, whether a Canadian passport may be revoked or refused on the basis of national security concerns has been questioned.\n\n==Types of passports==\nBefore 1947, there were two types of passports: those issued to people who were born British subjects (navy blue cover) and those issued to people naturalised as British subjects (red cover).\n\nToday, there are five types of Canadian passports:<ref name=\"pptp\" />\n\n;Regular Passport (navy blue cover): These documents are issued to citizens for occasional travel, such as vacations and business trips.  They contain 36 pages (29 pages available for visa labels and stamps).

The bilingual cover is indicative of the textual portions of Canadian passports being printed in both English and French, Canada's [[Official bilingualism in Canada|two official languages]]. The standard passport contains 36 pages, with 29 available for entry/exit stamps and visas. The size dimensions of a closed Canadian passport are 8.89&nbsp;cm (3.5\") by 12.7&nbsp;cm (5\").\n\nNew security features, similar to those on [[banknotes]], have been added with increasing frequency since 2001. [[Microprinting]], [[hologram|holographic images]], UV-visible imaging, [[watermark]]s and other details have been implemented, particularly on the photo page. As well, the photo is now digitally printed directly on the paper (in both standard and UV-reactive ink); previously, the actual photo had been laminated inside the document.\n\n[[File:Data Page of Canadian Passport.jpg|right|thumb|Personal Data Page of a Canadian passport, from 2002 to 2010]]\n\n===Data page===\n* Photo of the passport holder\n* Type (P)\n* Issuing Country  (listed as \"CAN\" for \"Canada\")\n* Passport No.\n* Surname\n* Given Names\n* Nationality (Canadian/Canadienne)\n* Date of Birth\n* Sex\n* Place of Birth (the city and three-letter country code are listed, even if born inside Canada)\n** Note: Province or State is required on the application form, if applicable, but is not listed in the passport.\n* Date of Issue\n* Issuing Authority\n* Date of Expiry\n\nThe information page ends with the Machine Readable Zone.\n\n====Signature====\nFrom 2002 until May 2015, all Canadian passports contained two signature spaces: one is on the data page where a scanned signature is printed along with other personal details, the other is a blank signature block on page 3.

Contrary to popular belief, however, a Canadian passport itself, be it valid or invalid, is only a ''[[prima facie]]'' proof of Canadian citizenship.

Such persons may be issued Canadian passports, as their provincial or territorial birth certificate are considered as proof of citizenship.

They took the form of a \"Letter of Request\" from the [[Governor General of Canada]]. These documents remained in use until, in 1915, Canadian passports were first issued in the British format, a ten section single sheet folder.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Jonathan|title=A History of Migration from Germany to Canada, 1850\u20131939|publisher=UBC Press|year=2006|page=163|isbn=978-0-7748-1216-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awZGrPonfSMC&pg=PA163&dq=%22in+1915+canada+abandoned+its+single-sheet+form%22&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22in%201915%20canada%20abandoned%20its%20single-sheet%20form%22&f=false|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe modern form of the Canadian passport came about in 1921. At that time, Canadians were [[British subject]]s, and Canada shared a common nationality with the United Kingdom; thus, Canadian passports were issued to those British subjects resident in or connected to Canada. This arrangement ended in 1947, when the [[Canadian Citizenship Act]] was granted [[Royal Assent]] and the designation of [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizenship]] was created. Beginning in July the following year, Canadian passports were issued to Canadian citizens only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immigroup.com/news/history-canadian-passports| title=THE HISTORY OF CANADIAN PASSPORTS| publisher=IMMIgroup| date=12 April 2013| accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1947 and 1970, Canadian citizens could only apply for passports by mail to Ottawa. Requirements were simple, and applicants claiming birth in Canada did not have to provide proof of birth. The lax security has led to numerous cases of misuse of the passport, so the Canadian Government tightened the application requirements from 1970. That year, the first three Passport Canada offices were opened in [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"INFO\" />\n\nIn 1985, the first version of machine-readable passports (MRP) was issued, in accordance with [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] standards. An amended version came into circulation in 1991, with additional security features and more stringent processing requirements. By 1993, a newer version of MRP was introduced, which contained unique features to prevent replication or alteration.<ref name=\"INFO\" />\n\nSince 11 December 2001, children have not been included in parents' passports, and passports have been issued for one person only.<ref name=\"cbsa\" />\n\nIn 2002, Passport Canada began to issue an updated version within Canada, which includes the digitally printed photo of the bearer embedded into the identification page of the booklet, holographic images, bar-coded serial number, and a second hidden photo of the bearer that could only be viewed under ultraviolet light. Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006.<ref name=\"INFO\" /> In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of [[Optically Variable Ink]] and addition of laser perforated number. The cover, watermark, personalisation technique and holographic laminate are same with the 2002 version. The 2010 version was also the last revision of MRP prior to the release of e-passports.<ref name=\"cbsa\" />\n\nIn the [[2008 Canadian federal budget|2008 federal budget]], [[Jim Flaherty]], Minister of Finance, announced that [[biometric passport]]s (\"e-passports\") would be introduced by 2011.<ref name=\"budget.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2008/pdf/plan-eng.pdf|title=Budget 2008: Responsible Leadership for Uncertain Times|publisher=}}</ref> A pilot project began in 2009, with e-passports being issued to special and diplomatic passport applicants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-diplomatic-and-special-passports-fact-file-1.2000076| title=Canadian diplomatic and special passports fact file| publisher=[[CTV Television Network]]| date=10 September 2014| accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> The e-passport roll-out was pushed back to 1 July 2013. On the same day, the issuing authority of Canadian passports was shifted from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), now known as IRCC.<ref name=\"order\" />\n\n==Application and issuance==\n\n{{main|Canadian nationality law}}\nThe issuance of passports falls under the [[Royal Prerogative]]. They are issued, in the name of the reigning [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] (as expressed in the [[#Passport note|passport note]]), according to the ''Canadian Passport Order''.<ref name=\"order\">{{Cite canlaw|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-81-86/FullText.html|linkloc=|wikilink=|type=reg|regtitle=Canadian Passport Order|regnumber=SI/81-86}}.</ref> This [[Order in Council]] specifies grounds for which [[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] (IRCC) can issue or renew a passport.\n\n===Passport requirements===\nUnder the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', all Canadian citizens have the right to enter Canada. Since 10 November 2016, under the new [[visa policy of Canada|visa regulations]] all visa-free passport holders (except for U.S. citizens and nationals) are required to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) before boarding a flight to Canada. This means there is now a ''de facto'' requirement for Canadian citizens to use a Canadian passport when travelling to or transiting through Canada by air, unless a special authorization is obtained within 10 days of travel.\n\nAs the eTA is used for the sole purpose of immigration screening for non-Canadian visitors entering Canada on a temporary basis, all Canadian citizens are automatically barred from applying the eTA. Hence the passport requirement is in place, because a Canadian citizen who travels on a visa-free, non-Canadian passport will be prevented from boarding the commercial flight to Canada unless he or she can present a valid Canadian passport during check-in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/dual-canadian-citizens.asp|title=Dual Canadian citizens need a valid Canadian passport|first=Government of Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Communications|last=Branch|website=www.cic.gc.ca}}</ref> The only exceptions to this rule are for a Canadian citizen travelling on a U.S. passport, as Americans do not need an eTA to enter Canada, or when a Canadian citizen travelling on an eTA-required passport enters Canada by sea or through [[List of Canada\u2013United States border crossings|one of the land ports of entry from the U.S.]]\n\n===Application===\nCanadians in Canada can submit their applications in person through a passport office, a [[Service Canada]] location, or can submit their applications by mail. Canadians in the U.S. or Bermuda can apply only by mail. Canadians living in other countries or territories are required to apply through the nearest [[List of diplomatic missions of Canada|Canadian diplomatic posts]] abroad. Expedited services (urgent, express and standard pick-ups) are only available through a passport office in Canada.\n\n===Guarantor of identity===\nCanadian passport issuing system is modelled after the United Kingdom, where all first-time passport applications are required to be \"countersigned\" by a person who has known the applicant for a minimum of 2 years and if issued outside of Canada the guarantor may be someone who works in a recognised profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications/when-to-sign-what-to-do|title=Countersigning passport applications and photos: When you must get a signature and what to do - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref> Australia and New Zealand have similar policies. The use of a guarantor is to serve \"as a security measure in the entitlement process and as a point of departure for the future investigation of statements made on the application form\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/atip-aiprp/publications/guarantor_citizenship-repondants_citoyennete.aspx?lang=eng|title=Global Affairs Canada|first1=Global Affairs|last1=Canada|first2=Affaires mondiales|last2=Canada|date=26 June 2013|access-date=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325033949/http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/atip-aiprp/publications/guarantor_citizenship-repondants_citoyennete.aspx?lang=eng|archive-date=25 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRules regarding the eligibility of guarantors were last updated on 12 August 2013. For passport applicants in Canada, only a Canadian passport holder can be a guarantor. For Canadian citizens living abroad who do not have a Canadian guarantor, a non-Canadian guarantor who works in a licensed profession may be used for application, such as a dentist, medical doctor, judge, lawyer, notary public, pharmacist, police officer, veterinarian, or sitting officer for a financial institution.\n\n===Passport fees===\n\nThe fee (since 1 July 2013) for a standard adult passport issued in Canada is $120 for a five-year passport or $160 for a ten-year passport, and outside of Canada is $190 and $260 respectively. The fee for a five-year passport for a child under 16 is $57 if issued in Canada, and $100 outside of Canada.   Additional fees are levied for urgent service or replacement of a lost or stolen passport. All fees are payable in [[Canadian dollars]].\n\n===Refusal and revocation of passports===\nIRCC may revoke a passport or refuse to issue or renew a passport on grounds set out in the ''Canadian Passport Order'', including such grounds as failure to submit a complete application, misrepresentation in obtaining a passport, and criminality. However, whether a Canadian passport may be revoked or refused on the basis of national security concerns has been questioned.\n\n==Types of passports==\nBefore 1947, there were two types of passports: those issued to people who were born British subjects (navy blue cover) and those issued to people naturalised as British subjects (red cover).\n\nToday, there are five types of Canadian passports:<ref name=\"pptp\" />\n\n;Regular Passport (navy blue cover): These documents are issued to citizens for occasional travel, such as vacations and business trips.

[[Microprinting]], [[hologram|holographic images]], UV-visible imaging, [[watermark]]s and other details have been implemented, particularly on the photo page.

Contrary to popular belief, however, a Canadian passport itself, be it valid or invalid, is only a ''[[prima facie]]'' proof of Canadian citizenship. Conclusive proof of Canadian citizenship, as dictated by the IRCC, only includes the following documents:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizenship/documents.asp|title=Documents we accept as proof of citizenship|first=Government of Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Communications|last=Branch|website=www.cic.gc.ca}}</ref>\n\n*Canadian citizenship certificate;\n*Canadian citizenship card;\n*Birth certificate from a Canadian province or territory;\n*Naturalisation certificate as a British subject in Canada (issued before 1 January 1947);\n*Registration of birth abroad certificate (issued between 1 January 1947 and 14 February 1977); and,\n*Certificates of retention (issued between 1 January 1947 and 14 February 1977)\n\nAlthough the provincial or territorial birth certificate is accepted by IRCC as valid proof of citizenship, Section 3(2) of the ''Citizenship Act'' declares that a child born in Canada to a diplomatic or consular officer or other representative of a foreign country, or an employee in the service of such person, is not a Canadian citizen if neither parent was a Canadian citizen or Canadian permanent resident at time of the child's birth. Such persons may be issued Canadian passports, as their provincial or territorial birth certificate are considered as proof of citizenship.

The bridge joins the main area of Nowra to North Nowra and [[Bomaderry]]. \n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge was originally intended to carry a double railway track, as part of the proposed extension of the [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast line]] to [[Jervis Bay]] and possibly {{NSWcity|Eden}}. However, the railway was never extended past [[Bomaderry (Nowra) railway station, New South Wales|Bomaderry station]] where trains still terminate today, so the bridge was converted for road traffic, as the residents of Nowra wanted a road bridge that connected Bomaderry to Nowra. \n\nThe bridge was designed by American engineer Charles Shaler Smith and is considered to be of local historical significance.<ref name=NSWHD/> The bridge was completed in 1881 and is built from wrought iron with a steel approach span. The bridge had a timber deck for 100 years until in 1981 reinforced concrete was laid over steel Armco decking. The pairs of cast iron piers are original and were supplied locally by the Atlas Foundry, Sydney. It was the largest bridge project in New South Wales prior to the 1889 [[Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge]]. Its full length is {{convert|342|m}}.<ref name=NSWHD/>\n\nThe two-lane bridge carries southbound traffic only. A newer concrete three-lane bridge carries northbound traffic on the Princes Highway.\n\n== Replacement bridge ==\nIn August 2019 [[Infrastructure Australia]] approved the construction of a new four-lane bridge immediately to the west (upriver) of the existing bridges.

The bridge joins the main area of Nowra to North Nowra and [[Bomaderry]]. \n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge was originally intended to carry a double railway track, as part of the proposed extension of the [[South Coast railway line, New South Wales|South Coast line]] to [[Jervis Bay]] and possibly {{NSWcity|Eden}}. However, the railway was never extended past [[Bomaderry (Nowra) railway station, New South Wales|Bomaderry station]] where trains still terminate today, so the bridge was converted for road traffic, as the residents of Nowra wanted a road bridge that connected Bomaderry to Nowra. \n\nThe bridge was designed by American engineer Charles Shaler Smith and is considered to be of local historical significance.<ref name=NSWHD/> The bridge was completed in 1881 and is built from wrought iron with a steel approach span. The bridge had a timber deck for 100 years until in 1981 reinforced concrete was laid over steel Armco decking. The pairs of cast iron piers are original and were supplied locally by the Atlas Foundry, Sydney. It was the largest bridge project in New South Wales prior to the 1889 [[Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge]]. Its full length is {{convert|342|m}}.<ref name=NSWHD/>\n\nThe two-lane bridge carries southbound traffic only. A newer concrete three-lane bridge carries northbound traffic on the Princes Highway.\n\n== Replacement bridge ==\nIn August 2019 [[Infrastructure Australia]] approved the construction of a new four-lane bridge immediately to the west (upriver) of the existing bridges. This new bridge would become the new crossing for northbound traffic. The existing northbound bridge would be converted for southbound traffic, allowing the bridge built in 1881 to be re-purposed for community uses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/map/nowra-bridge |title=Nowra Bridge |work=[[Infrastructure Australia]] |publisher=Australian Government |date=23 August 2019 |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref> The replacement bridge is expected to cost {{AUD}}342&nbsp;million;<ref>{{cite news |author=Crawford, Robert |url=https://www.southcoastregister.com.au/story/6666214/early-work-under-way-for-new-nowra-bridge/ |title=Preliminary work starts on Nowra bridge project |work=South Coast Register |publisher= |date=6 March 2020 |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref> with funding to be shared between the [[Australian Government|Commonwealth]] and [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales]] governments, and the private sector.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://infrastructurepipeline.org/project/new-nowra-bridge/ |title=New Nowra Bridge |work= |publisher=Infrastructure Partnerships Australia |date=28 February 2020 |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref> Work commenced in early 2020 and is expected to be completed in 2024.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/nowra-bridges-shoalhaven-river/index.html |title=Nowra Bridge project - Princes Highway upgrade |work=[[Roads and Maritime Services]]; Transport for New South Wales |publisher=Government of New South Wales |date=23 March 2020 |access-date=7 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://trove.nla.gov.au/picture/result?q=nowra+bridge Nowra Bridge] (Trove)\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an11101870-18 Bridge into Nowra over the Shoalhaven River] NLA Digital Collections\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170509234426/https://www.flickr.com/photos/7655131@N05/449042256/ Nowra - Second Bridge Construction] by Sandown (Flickr)\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1881]]\n[[Category:Steel bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Shoalhaven River]]\n[[Category:1881 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Nowra, New South Wales]]\n\n\n{{Australia-bridge-struct-stub}}\n{{NewSouthWales-struct-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "small\u2192bulleted list", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowra_Bridge"}
