It was created by [[Joss Whedon]] under his production tag, [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with later co-executive producers being [[Jane Espenson]], [[David Fury]], [[David Greenwalt]], [[Doug Petrie]], [[Marti Noxon]], and [[David Solomon (TV producer)|David Solomon]].\n\nThe series premiered on March 10, 1997, on [[The WB]] and concluded on May 20, 2003, on [[UPN]]. The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

She has returned from death twice and is known as a reluctant hero who wants to live a normal life.

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"<ref name = \"Guardian 21 July 2018\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]].

KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers. Anya dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun to destroy the Hellmouth and all the vampires within it, including himself. The collapse of the cavern creates a crater that swallows all of Sunnydale, while the survivors of the battle escape in a [[school bus]]. In the final scene, as the survivors survey the crater, Dawn asks, \"What are we going to do now?\" Buffy slowly begins to enigmatically smile as she contemplates the future ahead of her, ending the series on a hopeful note.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Joss Whedon by Gage Skidmore 8.jpg|200px|thumb|''Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series.]]\nWriter [[Joss Whedon]] says that \"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress\" was really the first incarnation of the ''Buffy'' concept, \"the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary\".<ref>{{cite AV media |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': Television with a Bite |people=Jack Walworth (Director), [[Bill Mumy]] (Narrator) |series=[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] |via=''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)#DVD release|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 6)]]'' DVD set, disc 6 ([[DVD region code|region 1]] release: May 25, 2004) |date=May 14, 2003 |minutes=2:15 |publisher=[[A&E Network]]}}</ref> This early, unproduced idea evolved into ''Buffy'', which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]\".<ref name=blondegirl>{{cite book |last=Billson |first=Anne |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=December 5, 2005 |pages=24\u201325|title-link=Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics) }}</ref> Whedon wanted \"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero\".<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained, \"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Allie |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html |title=Buffy's Angels |publisher=Metroactive.com |date=September 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

The series was created by ''Buffy'''s creator [[Joss Whedon]] in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by the production company [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]]. At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\".

Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

[[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"<ref name = \"Guardian 21 July 2018\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]].

KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow's line was to reply \"most of it\". Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line \"most of it\", as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.<ref>\"[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]\" ''Dark Horse Comics'' (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1\" released September 23, 1998).</ref> In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

These projects remain undeveloped and may never be [[greenlight|greenlit]]. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: ''[[Buffy: The Animated Series]]'' and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy: The Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': \"We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff \u2013 and nobody wanted it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon |author=Hockensmith, Steve |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<ref>Espenson, Jane, \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) & \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 11, 2006).</ref>\n\n''Ripper'' was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]] portrayed by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a [[Direct-to-video|DVD movie]].<ref>''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

He was a member of the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] from 1990 to 1995.\n\n==Life and career==\nHarrison Ngau was born in 1959 at his home village in Long Keseh, which is located near the [[Baram River]] in the northern region of [[Sarawak]]. In 1976, a logging company named WTK (short form for the company's founder, Wong Tuong Kwang) went to his village. Harrison was a 17-year-old boy who just had just completed second last year of his secondary school at [[Marudi]]. He went back to his village for a Christmas holiday when a large meeting convened in his longhouse. The villagers only realised that WTK company had just been granted a concession behind their longhouse when the company turned up with bulldozers, heavy machinaries, and chainsaws in front of them. The villagers initially mooted the idea of stopping the loggers, however when company workers sent them some free biscuits and [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], the villagers accepted the food and the resistance died down. It was later turned out that two villagers in the longhouse own shares in another logging company who owned the concession. They sold to concession to WTK and made a handsome profit. Since Harrison was the only one who know how write, he offered himself to write letters to the company. WTK later agreed to pay a compensation of RM 2 (US$0.60) for every tonne of timber taken from their area.<ref name=\"Money Logging\">{{cite book |last1=Lukas |first1=Straumann |title=Money Logging On the Trail of the Asian Timber Mafia |date=2014 |publisher=[[Bergli Books]] |location=Basel, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-905252-72-9 |pages=111\u2013116 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Money_Logging.html?id=-F8aCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Harrison&f=false |accessdate=2 November 2018 |language=English |chapter= Chapter 5 \u2013  Blowpipes against bulldozers}}</ref>\n\nHarrison then went on to work in a hotel in [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], an ice factory, and with Shell oil company. In 1980, he started Sarawak branch of Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM), an environmental and human rights organisation in Malaysia. He went to Marudi rented an office for his organisation. In November 1980, he was married to 17-year-old Uding, another Kayan from a nearby village. They raised four children and continue to campaigned against logging companies in Baram region. The first protest was at the Apoh river against the Samling logging company. The Kayans from three longhouses went to threatened the company's employees. The company then agreed to pay compensation to the three longhouses. Harrison's organisation was primarily involved in advising the indigenous people in exercising their land rights. In the mid 1980s, the [[Penan people]] started turn up to his office when they themselves were also affected by logging.<ref name=\"Money Logging\"/>\n\nThe biggest protest came in March 1987 when 4,700 indigenous people from 26 Penan villages and six longhouses turned up simultaneously to prevent loggers from reaching upper Baram and [[Limbang]] region. Around 200 bulldozers and 1,600 timber workers were held up for several months. After a few months, the blockade was forcefully dismantled by the police. On 27 October 1987, [[Operation Lalang]] was started by the then Malaysian prime minister, [[Mahathir Mohamad]]. Harrison was arrested under [[Internal Security Act 1960|Internal Security Act]]. Harrison was flown to Miri and spent a night at a cell there before he was transported to [[Kuching]] through an off-road vehicle. He was held for 60 days and nights but no charge was brought against him. Harrison was released in December 1987.

The AR-50 weighs approximately 34 pounds and is a single-shot bolt-action rifle. The barrel is thick and rigid, to prevent it from flexing. All AR-50 barrels use 1:15 right hand [[rifling]].\n\nThe receiver features Armalite's octagonal design, which strengthens the receiver against flexing.

To differentiate itself from the members' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group's sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, [[mask]]s, and [[pseudonyms]]. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band [[GWAR]]. \"We played our first show on a Saturday\" said the band's drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead's official website.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} \u201cThree days later, we got a call to play with GWAR at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people \u2013 our second show ever!\u201d.<ref name=\"FSOS\">{{cite web|title=Mushroomhead|url=http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=5596813262|accessdate=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027190154/http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=5596813262|archivedate=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, ''[[Mushroomhead (Album)|Mushroomhead]]'', with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co.

Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA ([[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]) (Now called \"Impact Wrestling\") used their hit single \"Come On\" as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that guitarist [[Dave Felton|Gravy]] and bassist [[Jack Kilcoyne|Pig Benis]] would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave \"Gravy\" Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was \"kicked out of the band.\"[[File:ST1TCH in Florida.jpg|thumb|right|230px|ST1TCH performing in Florida]] In May 2012, Daniel \"Lil Dan\" Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from [[Hed PE]]) had taken over Fox's percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox's drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him \"Tall E\" in reference to Fox's nickname being \"Lil Dan\". On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 \"Old School Show\".\n\n===''The Righteous & the Butterfly'', return of J Mann and departure of Waylon Reavis and Jeffrey Nothing (2012\u20132019)===\n[[File:Mushroomhead Live by Luis Blanco (1).jpg|thumb|left|280px|Mushroomhead playing live in 2013]]In September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page.

Drummer Steve Felton described it as \"very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will.

The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band's look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours.\nIn January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in [[Face Off (season 4)|Season 4 of original SyFy series \"Face Off\"]], a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bedfordtimesregister.com/news/article/4894926 |title=Mushroomhead sprouts new recording |publisher=Bedfordtimesregister.com |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222115/http://www.bedfordtimesregister.com/news/article/4894926 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother common visual trait that Mushroomhead is known for, are the use of [[water drum]]s, which are performed by all the percussionists in the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/who-were-those-masked-men-why-mushroomhead-6496832|title=Who Were Those Masked Men?

Over their lifetime, Mushroomhead has gone through many changes in band lineups, with drummer [[Steve Felton]] being the only consistent member.\n\n==History==\n=== Debut album, ''Superbuick'' and ''M3'' (1993\u20132000) ===\nIn 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group's sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, [[mask]]s, and [[pseudonyms]]. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band [[GWAR]]. \"We played our first show on a Saturday\" said the band's drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead's official website.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} \u201cThree days later, we got a call to play with GWAR at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people \u2013 our second show ever!\u201d.<ref name=\"FSOS\">{{cite web|title=Mushroomhead|url=http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=5596813262|accessdate=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027190154/http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=5596813262|archivedate=27 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, ''[[Mushroomhead (Album)|Mushroomhead]]'', with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released ''[[Superbuick]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=second demo by mushroomhead call superbuick|url=http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick|accessdate=2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211306/http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick/|archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref> In 1999, Mushroomhead released ''[[M3 (Album)|M3]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=M3 would be the last EP by mushroomhead|url=http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick|accessdate=2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211306/http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick/|archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref> which was the final album self-financed and self-released by the band.\n\n===''XX'' and ''XIII'' (2000\u20132005)===\nIn 2001, Mushroomhead released a compilation album titled ''[[XX (Mushroomhead album)|XX]]'' on the independent label [[Eclipse Records]]. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2\u20133 months,<ref>Verified through use of Nielsen Soundscan</ref> the band signed with major label [[Universal Records]] and the compilation was remastered and re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including [[Ozzfest]] 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video \"[[Solitaire/Unraveling]]\". Also in 2001, guitarist [[John Sekula|J.J. Righteous]] was replaced by one of the band's previous stage dancers & then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of ''[[XIII (Mushroomhead album)|XIII]]'', their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single \"Sun Doesn't Rise\" which was featured on ''MTV: [[Headbangers Ball]]'' and the [[Freddy vs. Jason (soundtrack)|''Freddy vs Jason'' soundtrack]]. Also featuring the hidden track \"Crazy\", a song originally by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]].

He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, [[Waylon Reavis|Waylon]]. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first [[DVD]] on its own Filthy Hands label \u2013 \"[[Volume 1 (Mushroomhead video album)|Volume 1]]\". Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band's rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage.\n\nWhile on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with [[Megaforce Records]], ensuring the new album's availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat \u2013 an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|flash]] feature as a part of the band's official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]-style environment, with each member having a unique [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]].\n\nMushroomhead headlined with [[Dope (band)|Dope]], [[Nocturne (band)|Nocturne]], and [[New Orleans]] locals [[Invain]] on the Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by [[J\u00e4germeister]] at the [[House of Blues]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to [[Hurricane Katrina]] striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005.\n\n===''Savior Sorrow'' and ''Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children'' (2005\u20132012)===\n''[[Savior Sorrow]]'' was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No.&nbsp;45 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts with sales exceeding 12,000.<ref name=Billboard /> The band's label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour.<ref name=Billboard /> As a result, [[SoundScan]] issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates.<ref name=Billboard /> The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the [[Best Buy]] retailer chain. Sales of Savior Sorrow were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No.&nbsp;30 spot than No.&nbsp;73. Savior Sorrow's chart position was later officially adjusted to No.&nbsp;50. \"Simple Survival\", the pre-released single to [[Savior Sorrow]], was placed at No.&nbsp;39 on the Billboard [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart one week after the release.<ref name=Billboard />  Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil' Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer.\n\nThe band has performed three shows on the [[Mayhem Festival]] tour, filling in for [[Bullet for My Valentine]]. Live footage was compiled into the band's second DVD, titled \"Volume 2\". On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger's Ball for \"12 Hundred\" from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the \"Volume 2\" DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including \"12 Hundred\", \"Simple Survival\", \"Burn\", the short video for \"Tattoo\", \"Save Us\" and \"Embrace the Ending\", video commentary and behind the scenes footage. To support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with [[The Autumn Offering]], XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album.\n\nThey released ''[[Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children (album)|Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children]]'' in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No.&nbsp;1 best selling metal album on [[iTunes]].

Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA ([[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]) (Now called \"Impact Wrestling\") used their hit single \"Come On\" as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that guitarist [[Dave Felton|Gravy]] and bassist [[Jack Kilcoyne|Pig Benis]] would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave \"Gravy\" Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was \"kicked out of the band.\"[[File:ST1TCH in Florida.jpg|thumb|right|230px|ST1TCH performing in Florida]] In May 2012, Daniel \"Lil Dan\" Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from [[Hed PE]]) had taken over Fox's percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox's drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him \"Tall E\" in reference to Fox's nickname being \"Lil Dan\". On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 \"Old School Show\".\n\n===''The Righteous & the Butterfly'', return of J Mann and departure of Waylon Reavis and Jeffrey Nothing (2012\u20132019)===\n[[File:Mushroomhead Live by Luis Blanco (1).jpg|thumb|left|280px|Mushroomhead playing live in 2013]]In September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page.

The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.\n\nTheir eighth album was the only one to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Steve Felton described it as \"very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it's going to go.

I know when we started the band, we were really into a lot of the stuff [[Mike Patton]] was doing - Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, things like that.

It's pretty vast.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/j-mann-of-mushroomhead|title=J-Mann of Mushroomhead : Songwriter Interviews|website=www.songfacts.com}}</ref>\n\n==Artistry==\n===Image and visuals===\nThe members of Mushroomhead have identified themselves by wearing masks and by its distinct \u201cX Face\u201d logo \u2013 commonly worn on the masks of most members, as well as clothing and merchandise. The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band's look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours.\nIn January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in [[Face Off (season 4)|Season 4 of original SyFy series \"Face Off\"]], a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bedfordtimesregister.com/news/article/4894926 |title=Mushroomhead sprouts new recording |publisher=Bedfordtimesregister.com |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222115/http://www.bedfordtimesregister.com/news/article/4894926 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAnother common visual trait that Mushroomhead is known for, are the use of [[water drum]]s, which are performed by all the percussionists in the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/who-were-those-masked-men-why-mushroomhead-6496832|title=Who Were Those Masked Men?

The feud erupted mostly among fans of both bands.

Paul Gray, This feud needs to end. Much Love and Respect to the guys in Slipknot\".\n\nIn 2012, [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] singer [[Corey Taylor]] has stated that he never had a problem with the band, he only had a problem with the behavior of their fans due to a situation Slipknot faced when they played in Mushroomhead's home town in Cleveland, OH and said there was never a real feud between bands but the feud was between Mushroomhead fans and Slipknot fans.

In the 2019 [[2019 New Year Honours|New Year Honours List]], Owen was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to scientific research.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAdrian Owen was born 17 May 1966 in [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], England, and educated at [[Gravesend Grammar School]], graduating in the same final year class as actor [[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]]. His first degree was in Psychology from [[University College London]] 1985\u20131988. As a student he shared accommodation with Psychologist and best-selling author [[Richard Wiseman]]. Owen completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], London (now part of [[King's College London]]) between 1988 and 1992.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1992, Owen began his post-doctoral research in the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute|Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University]], working with Michael Petrides and [[Brenda Milner]]. He was awarded The Pinsent Darwin Scholarship by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1996 and returned to the UK to work at the newly opened [[Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre]], Cambridge. In 1997 he moved to the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s [[Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit]] (CBU), Cambridge (formally the [[Applied Psychology Unit]]) to set up the neuroimaging programme there and to pursue his research in cognitive neuroscience. He was awarded MRC tenure in 2000 and made Assistant Director of the MRC CBU in 2005, with overall responsibility for the onsite imaging facilities (3T Siemens Tim Trio MRI and 306-channel Elekta-Neuromag MEG systems).\n\nIn 2010, Owen was awarded a $10M Canada Excellence Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging at [[The University of Western Ontario]] (UWO)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cerc.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/former-ancien-eng.aspx|title=Adrian Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=Canada Excellence Research Chairs|access-date=13 April 2016}}</ref> and moved most of his research team to [[Canada]] in order to take up this position in January 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.westernu.ca/2010/05/one-of-britains-best-picks-western/|title = One of Britain's best picks Western|last = Travis|first = Heather|date = 27 May 2010|website = Western News|language = en-US|access-date = 13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019 Owen was the guest for the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[The Life Scientific]].<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009ksc</ref>\n\n==Research==\nOver the last 30 years, Owen has published more than 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers and over 40 chapters and books.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.owenlab.uwo.ca/publications/index.html|title = Publications - Owen Lab|website = Western University|access-date = 13 April 2016}}</ref> His work has appeared in many of the world's most prestigious scientific and medical journals, including [[Science (journal)|Science]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[The Lancet (journal)|The Lancet]] and [[The New England Journal of Medicine]].

His first degree was in Psychology from [[University College London]] 1985\u20131988. As a student he shared accommodation with Psychologist and best-selling author [[Richard Wiseman]]. Owen completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], London (now part of [[King's College London]]) between 1988 and 1992.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1992, Owen began his post-doctoral research in the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute|Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University]], working with Michael Petrides and [[Brenda Milner]]. He was awarded The Pinsent Darwin Scholarship by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1996 and returned to the UK to work at the newly opened [[Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre]], Cambridge. In 1997 he moved to the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s [[Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit]] (CBU), Cambridge (formally the [[Applied Psychology Unit]]) to set up the neuroimaging programme there and to pursue his research in cognitive neuroscience. He was awarded MRC tenure in 2000 and made Assistant Director of the MRC CBU in 2005, with overall responsibility for the onsite imaging facilities (3T Siemens Tim Trio MRI and 306-channel Elekta-Neuromag MEG systems).\n\nIn 2010, Owen was awarded a $10M Canada Excellence Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging at [[The University of Western Ontario]] (UWO)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cerc.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/former-ancien-eng.aspx|title=Adrian Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=Canada Excellence Research Chairs|access-date=13 April 2016}}</ref> and moved most of his research team to [[Canada]] in order to take up this position in January 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://news.westernu.ca/2010/05/one-of-britains-best-picks-western/|title = One of Britain's best picks Western|last = Travis|first = Heather|date = 27 May 2010|website = Western News|language = en-US|access-date = 13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019 Owen was the guest for the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[The Life Scientific]].<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009ksc</ref>\n\n==Research==\nOver the last 30 years, Owen has published more than 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers and over 40 chapters and books.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.owenlab.uwo.ca/publications/index.html|title = Publications - Owen Lab|website = Western University|access-date = 13 April 2016}}</ref> His work has appeared in many of the world's most prestigious scientific and medical journals, including [[Science (journal)|Science]], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], [[The Lancet (journal)|The Lancet]] and [[The New England Journal of Medicine]].

Both sequels were also box office successes, but neither was praised as much as their predecessor. The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film is scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, Neo is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She suggests to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, Cypher is killed by [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

After [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]], the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, ''[[Bound (1996 film)|Bound]]'' and ''The Matrix'', in the contract.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.

Both sequels were also box office successes, but neither was praised as much as their predecessor. The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film is scheduled for release on May 21, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus's attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, Neo is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus's hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She suggests to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, Cypher is killed by [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia.
