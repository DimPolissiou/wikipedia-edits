This was especially the case in North America, but postwar reductions and shutdowns also occurred on British, French and other Western European urban rail networks. However, traditional tramway systems survived, and eventually even began to thrive from the late 20th century onward, some eventually operating as much as when they were first built over a century ago. Their numbers have been augmented by modern tramway or [[light rail]] systems in cities which had discarded this form of transport.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{Main|Trams in Europe}}\nMuch tramway infrastructure was lost during the mid-20th century in many European cities, although not on the same scale as in other parts of the world (such as North America). Most of Eastern Europe retained tramway systems until recently, but some cities are reconsidering their transport priorities. Some Western European cities are rehabilitating, upgrading, expanding and reconstructing old tramway lines, and many Western European towns and cities are building new tram lines.\n\n== North America ==\n{{Main|Streetcars in North America|Light rail in North America}}\nIn North America (especially the United States), trams are generally known as streetcars or trolleys; a \"tram\" is a [[tourist trolley]], an [[aerial tramway]] or a [[people mover]]. Streetcar lines were largely torn up during the mid-20th century for a variety of financial, technological and social reasons, and comparably few exist today. The [[Sistema de Tren El\u00e9ctrico Urbano]] in [[Guadalajara, Mexico]] has the highest annual ridership among light rail systems in North America.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{main|Light rail in Canada}}\nMost of the country's streetcar systems disappeared after World War II, giving way to buses:\n* [[Windsor, Ontario Streetcar System|Windsor]] (1937)\n* [[Kitchener Public Utilities Commission]] (1946)\n* [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]] (1947)\n* [[Nova Scotia Light and Power|Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] (1949)\n* [[Edmonton Radial Railway]], [[Saskatoon Transit|Saskatoon Municipal Railway]] and [[Hamilton Street Railway]] (1951)\n* [[Vancouver]] (1955)\n* [[Ottawa Transportation Commission]] and [[Montreal Tramways Company]] (1959)\n\nToronto's system grew with the abandonment of streetcar operations in the United States and the rest of Canada, as the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] purchased cars from many former operators. The Toronto system grew to become the [[Toronto streetcar system|largest streetcar system]] in the Americas. \n\nDuring the late 20th century, several cities installed [[light rail]] systems (partially along the same corridors as the streetcars). Some have restored their old streetcars and run them as a heritage ride for tourists; an example is the [[Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway]].\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Light rail in the United States}}\nHorsecars were in use on New York City streets as early as 1832,<ref>[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co]. Retrieved 25 February 2009.</ref> and the St. Charles Avenue Line of New Orleans' streetcar system is the oldest continuously operating [[street railway]] system in the world, beginning operation as a horse-drawn system in 1835.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norta.com/about/index.html |title=About the RTA |publisher=New Orleans Regional Transit Authority |accessdate=2013-05-14}}</ref> Motive power was eventually largely transitioned to [[steam engine]]-hauled locomotives, then in 1873 the first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]]. As electric traction became popular, streetcar and [[interurban]] systems proliferated across the United States. Passenger interurban railways had largely declined in use by the late 1920's. The [[Great Depression]] led to the closure of many streetcar lines, but [[World War II]] stopped the closure of many systems as they provided transportation during a time when gasoline and rubber tires were rationed. [[Pittsburgh]] kept most of its streetcar system (serving the city and many suburbs) until January 27, 1967, making it the longest-lasting large-network U.S. streetcar system.{{Explain|date=March 2018|reason=What about the other cities which kept their systems?}}\n\nExceptions to streetcar closures of the 1960's included the cities of New Orleans, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]], Boston, and San Francisco. These systems generally had more lines and larger service areas which were replaced by buses or largely scaled back. These surviving \"legacy\" systems generally used preexisting tunnels, had exclusive [[right of way]]s, or were upgraded to light rail specifications around the 1980's.\n\nThe [[San Diego Trolley]] inaugurated service in 1981 as the first newly built light rail system in the United States since the 50's. The [[American Public Transportation Association]] counts 33 light rail systems operating in the country {{As of|2019|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transit Ridership Report: Third Quarter |url=https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019-Q3-Ridership-APTA.pdf |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Central America ==\n\n=== {{anchor|Republic of Panama}}Panama ===\n[[Trams in Panama]] predate the country's founding; tram service began in 1893 in Panama City, in what was then [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|Colombia]].

The vintage carriages (without the end doors) remained in operation until 2013.\n\nUsing Line A's surface [[non-revenue track]]s in the [[Caballito, Buenos Aires|Caballito]] neighborhood, the [[Trams in Buenos Aires#Historic Tramway|Asociaci\u00f3n Amigos del Tranv\u00eda]] (Friends of the Tramway Association)<ref>[http://www.tranvia.org.ar/ www.tranvia.org.ar] Association of Tramway Friends  \u2013 accessed December 10, 2008</ref> operates a [[heritage streetcar]] service with restored tram and metro cars on weekends and holidays from the [[Polvor\u00edn Workshop]]. The [[Tren de la Costa]] (Coastal Train), a light-rail service running on a right-of-way formerly used from 1891 to 1961, began in 1995. Serving tourists and commuters, it runs from the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires to [[Tigre, Buenos Aires|Tigre]] along the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] for about {{convert|15|km}}. The [[PreMetro E2 (Buenos Aires)|PreMetro E2]] operates as a feeder at the end of Metro [[Line E (Buenos Aires)|Line E]] in the western suburbs. In central Buenos Aires, the [[Tranv\u00eda del Este]] (or Puerto Madero Tramway) was an experimental tramway which operated on a {{convert|2|km|adj=on}} route in the Puerto Madero District from 2007 to 2012 with a single-car [[Alstom Citadis]] tram\u2014two cars during the first year\u2014on loan from Madrid.

[[:pt:VLT_de_Cuiab\u00e1|Cuiab\u00e1]], with two lines, {{convert|23|km}} of track and 33 stations, is in the final stages of implementing its light-rail system.\n\n===Ecuador===\nThe [[Ecuador]]ian city of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s first [[Cuenca tram|tram line]] will open in 2019.\n\n== Asia ==\n[[File:Kolkata Tram.jpg|thumb|190px|Trams in Kolkata is Asia's oldest operating tram system.]]\n[[File:HKtram.JPG|thumb|190px|alt=Green double-deck tram|Double-deck trams continue to run in Hong Kong.]]\n{{Main|Trams in Asia}}\nAlthough tram systems were well-established in Asia at the start of the 20th century, they began a steady decline during the mid to late 1930s. The 1960s marked the end of the continent's dominance in public transportation, with most major systems closed and their equipment and rail sold for scrap; however, a number of systems continue to operate in the Russian Far East and Japan. [[Trams in Kolkata|Kolkata]] has Asia's oldest operating electric tram system which currently runs 6 routes, operating since 1902. There is rekindled interest in tram transport with surviving systems being upgraded and new systems being constructed. In China, several new systems have opened in the past few years with several more under construction.\n\nThe first Japanese tram line began in 1895 as the Kyoto Electric Railroad. The tram reached its zenith in 1932, when 82 rail companies operated {{convert|1479|km}} of track in 65 cities. Its popularity declined during the rest of the decade, a trend accelerated by the [[Pacific War]], the [[occupation of Japan]] and the [[Post-occupation Japan|rebuilding years]]. Although many of the remaining tramways were shut down and dismantled in favor of auto, bus, and heavy rail service during the 1960s, A few tram systems remained in smaller Japanese cities.\n\n== Australasia ==\n[[File:C 3009 at St Vincents Plaza on route 109, 2004 (tram).jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Tram at a station|Newer [[Citadis]] Melbourne tram]]\n[[File:FC 2 test, surfers paradise boulevard, March 2014.JPG|thumb|190x190px|alt=Yellow-and-blue tram|[[Flexity 2]] G:link tram being tested on the Gold Coast]]\n{{Main|Trams in Australia|Trams in New Zealand|Trams in Melbourne|Light rail in Sydney}}\nIn [[Australasia]], trams are used extensively in [[Melbourne]]; all other major cities largely dismantled their legacy networks by the 1970s. [[Adelaide]] retained one line between the city and Glenelg (which has been extended), and work on a new line is in progress. \n\n[[Sydney]] reintroduced tram service on the [[Dulwich Hill Line]] in 1997, with a second [[CBD and South East Light Rail]] line opened in 2019. A new [[Parramatta Light Rail]] line is currently under construction and will add to light rail in Sydney however will be separate from the other Sydney light rail lines. \n\nThe 2010s saw increased investment in new light rail construction with the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] opening the [[G:link]] in 2014, [[Canberra]] opening its first light rail line in 2019 and Newcastle opening a new line also in 2019.\n\n[[Ballarat]], [[Bendigo]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Auckland]] have reintroduced trams as heritage operations.\n\nA distinctive feature of many classic Australasian trams was their early use of a lowered central section between [[bogies]] (wheel sets), intended to make passenger access easier by reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. Cars with this feature were known as \"drop-centres\".\n\n== Africa ==\n=== Egypt ===\n[[File:Egypt.Alexandria.Tram.01.jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Yellow tram next to a yellow car|Former Copenhagen articulated car in service on Alexandria's urban tramway]]\n[[File:Egypt.Cairo.Tram.01.jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Older tram at a station|The tram from Heliopolis terminates at Cairo's Rameses Station.]]\nAlthough [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]] have historic systems which still exist, the once-extensive Cairo urban system is nearly defunct. The express tram line to and within Masr el-Djedida ([[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]]) is still in operation. It is an example of a surviving [[interurban]] electric railway, the ancestor of light rail. A small 1970s system in the city of [[Helwan]], {{convert|25|km}} south, is still operational. Some of Cairo's cars are former [[Toronto Transit Commission]] [[PCC streetcar]]s.\n\nAlexandria's urban system and express routes to its eastern suburbs are still in operation. The urban system operates yellow cars (including some acquired from [[Copenhagen]]), primarily on street track. The express system (Ramleh routes) operates three-car blue trains, including some double-deck cars, on largely [[reserved track]].

The [[Cape Town and Green Point Tramway Company]] was formed in September 1862, and began operations on April 1, 1863.\n\nSingle- and double-deck horse-drawn trams were used. Cape Town's electric tram system initially had ten cars which were built in [[Philadelphia]]. Lady Sivewright, the wife of [[James Sivewright]], opened the new system on August 6, 1896. At the time of Queen Victoria's [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897, Cape Town and its suburbs had 32 electric trams running on about {{convert|23|mi}} of track. The new power station was inadequate, and had to be expanded.

This was especially the case in North America, but postwar reductions and shutdowns also occurred on British, French and other Western European urban rail networks. However, traditional tramway systems survived, and eventually even began to thrive from the late 20th century onward, some eventually operating as much as when they were first built over a century ago. Their numbers have been augmented by modern tramway or [[light rail]] systems in cities which had discarded this form of transport.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{Main|Trams in Europe}}\nMuch tramway infrastructure was lost during the mid-20th century in many European cities, although not on the same scale as in other parts of the world (such as North America). Most of Eastern Europe retained tramway systems until recently, but some cities are reconsidering their transport priorities. Some Western European cities are rehabilitating, upgrading, expanding and reconstructing old tramway lines, and many Western European towns and cities are building new tram lines.\n\n== North America ==\n{{Main|Streetcars in North America|Light rail in North America}}\nIn North America (especially the United States), trams are generally known as streetcars or trolleys; a \"tram\" is a [[tourist trolley]], an [[aerial tramway]] or a [[people mover]]. Streetcar lines were largely torn up during the mid-20th century for a variety of financial, technological and social reasons, and comparably few exist today. The [[Sistema de Tren El\u00e9ctrico Urbano]] in [[Guadalajara, Mexico]] has the highest annual ridership among light rail systems in North America.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{main|Light rail in Canada}}\nMost of the country's streetcar systems disappeared after World War II, giving way to buses:\n* [[Windsor, Ontario Streetcar System|Windsor]] (1937)\n* [[Kitchener Public Utilities Commission]] (1946)\n* [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]] (1947)\n* [[Nova Scotia Light and Power|Nova Scotia Light and Power Company, Limited]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] (1949)\n* [[Edmonton Radial Railway]], [[Saskatoon Transit|Saskatoon Municipal Railway]] and [[Hamilton Street Railway]] (1951)\n* [[Vancouver]] (1955)\n* [[Ottawa Transportation Commission]] and [[Montreal Tramways Company]] (1959)\n\nToronto's system grew with the abandonment of streetcar operations in the United States and the rest of Canada, as the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] purchased cars from many former operators. The Toronto system grew to become the [[Toronto streetcar system|largest streetcar system]] in the Americas. \n\nDuring the late 20th century, several cities installed [[light rail]] systems (partially along the same corridors as the streetcars). Some have restored their old streetcars and run them as a heritage ride for tourists; an example is the [[Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway]].\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Light rail in the United States}}\nHorsecars were in use on New York City streets as early as 1832,<ref>[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co].

As electric traction became popular, streetcar and [[interurban]] systems proliferated across the United States. Passenger interurban railways had largely declined in use by the late 1920's. The [[Great Depression]] led to the closure of many streetcar lines, but [[World War II]] stopped the closure of many systems as they provided transportation during a time when gasoline and rubber tires were rationed. [[Pittsburgh]] kept most of its streetcar system (serving the city and many suburbs) until January 27, 1967, making it the longest-lasting large-network U.S. streetcar system.{{Explain|date=March 2018|reason=What about the other cities which kept their systems?}}\n\nExceptions to streetcar closures of the 1960's included the cities of New Orleans, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]], Boston, and San Francisco. These systems generally had more lines and larger service areas which were replaced by buses or largely scaled back. These surviving \"legacy\" systems generally used preexisting tunnels, had exclusive [[right of way]]s, or were upgraded to light rail specifications around the 1980's.\n\nThe [[San Diego Trolley]] inaugurated service in 1981 as the first newly built light rail system in the United States since the 50's.

The 1960s marked the end of the continent's dominance in public transportation, with most major systems closed and their equipment and rail sold for scrap; however, a number of systems continue to operate in The Russian Far East and Japan. [[Trams in Kolkata|Kolkata]] has Asia's oldest operating electric tram system which currently runs 6 routes, operating since 1902. There is rekindled interest in tram transport with surviving systems being upgraded and new systems being constructed. In China, several new systems have opened in the past few years with several more under construction.\n\nThe first Japanese tram line began in 1895 as the Kyoto Electric Railroad. The tram reached its zenith in 1932, when 82 rail companies operated {{convert|1479|km}} of track in 65 cities. Its popularity declined during the rest of the decade, a trend accelerated by the [[Pacific War]], the [[occupation of Japan]] and the [[Post-occupation Japan|rebuilding years]]. Although many of the remaining tramways were shut down and dismantled in favor of auto, bus, and heavy rail service during the 1960s, A few tram systems remained in smaller Japanese cities.\n\n== Australasia ==\n[[File:C 3009 at St Vincents Plaza on route 109, 2004 (tram).jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Tram at a station|Newer [[Citadis]] Melbourne tram]]\n[[File:FC 2 test, surfers paradise boulevard, March 2014.JPG|thumb|190x190px|alt=Yellow-and-blue tram|[[Flexity 2]] G:link tram being tested on the Gold Coast]]\n{{Main|Trams in Australia|Trams in New Zealand|Trams in Melbourne|Light rail in Sydney}}\nIn [[Australasia]], trams are used extensively in [[Melbourne]]; all other major cities largely dismantled their legacy networks by the 1970s. [[Adelaide]] retained one line between the city and Glenelg (which has been extended), and work on a new line is in progress. \n\n[[Sydney]] reintroduced tram service on the [[Dulwich Hill Line]] in 1997, with a second [[CBD and South East Light Rail]] line opened in 2019. A new [[Parramatta Light Rail]] line is currently under construction and will add to light rail in Sydney however will be separate from the other Sydney light rail lines. \n\nThe 2010s saw increased investment in new light rail construction with the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] opening the [[G:link]] in 2014, [[Canberra]] opening its first light rail line in 2019 and Newcastle opening a new line also in 2019.\n\n[[Ballarat]], [[Bendigo]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Auckland]] have reintroduced trams as heritage operations.\n\nA distinctive feature of many classic Australasian trams was their early use of a lowered central section between [[bogies]] (wheel sets), intended to make passenger access easier by reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. Cars with this feature were known as \"drop-centres\".\n\n== Africa ==\n=== Egypt ===\n[[File:Egypt.Alexandria.Tram.01.jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Yellow tram next to a yellow car|Former Copenhagen articulated car in service on Alexandria's urban tramway]]\n[[File:Egypt.Cairo.Tram.01.jpg|thumb|190px|alt=Older tram at a station|The tram from Heliopolis terminates at Cairo's Rameses Station.]]\nAlthough [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]] have historic systems which still exist, the once-extensive Cairo urban system is nearly defunct. The express tram line to and within Masr el-Djedida ([[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]]) is still in operation. It is an example of a surviving [[interurban]] electric railway, the ancestor of light rail. A small 1970s system in the city of [[Helwan]], {{convert|25|km}} south, is still operational. Some of Cairo's cars are former [[Toronto Transit Commission]] [[PCC streetcar]]s.\n\nAlexandria's urban system and express routes to its eastern suburbs are still in operation. The urban system operates yellow cars (including some acquired from [[Copenhagen]]), primarily on street track. The express system (Ramleh routes) operates three-car blue trains, including some double-deck cars, on largely [[reserved track]]. There are also some dual-system routes.\n\n===Ethiopia===\nIn [[Ethiopia]], construction by [[China Railway Group Limited]] was ongoing on [[Addis Ababa Light Rail]] in 2013.<ref name=\"Alrp\">{{cite news |url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2013/10/addis-light-rail-progress/ |title=Addis Light Rail Progress |newspaper=Railways Africa |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref> The Ethiopian Railway Corporation began construction of the {{convert|34.25|km|mi|1|adj=on}} double-track electrified light rail project in December 2011, funded by the [[Export-Import Bank of China]].<ref name=\"Alrpd\">{{cite news |url=http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/herald/news/248-corporation-discloses-addis-light-rail-project-detail |title=Corporation discloses/Addis light rail project detail |newspaper=The Ethiopian Herald |date=10 March 2013 |accessdate=2014-10-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109172123/http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/herald/news/248-corporation-discloses-addis-light-rail-project-detail |archivedate=November 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Initially, the system would have two lines.

A new light-rail line began operation in 1985, and has been followed by other systems.\n\n=== South Africa ===\nPublic transport in [[South Africa]] began in [[Cape Town]] in May 1801, when a weekly coach service to [[Simon's Town]] was announced. The Cape's first horse-drawn [[Bus|omnibus]] was introduced, based on [[George Shilbeer]]'s model. The [[Cape Town and Green Point Tramway Company]] was formed in September 1862, and began operations on April 1, 1863.\n\nSingle- and double-deck horse-drawn trams were used. Cape Town's electric tram system initially had ten cars which were built in [[Philadelphia]]. Lady Sivewright, the wife of [[James Sivewright]], opened the new system on August 6, 1896. At the time of Queen Victoria's [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]] in 1897, Cape Town and its suburbs had 32 electric trams running on about {{convert|23|mi}} of track. The new power station was inadequate, and had to be expanded. Tram service also existed in [[Pretoria]], [[Durban]] and [[Johannesburg]] (where the Rand Tram, the suburban railway to [[Boksburg]], opened in 1890), but were replaced by petrol, diesel and [[trolleybus]] systems by the early 1960s.\n\n== {{anchor|World largest tram systems}}World's largest tram systems ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Nr\n!

With a turnover of \u00a363m, the company had run out of cash after a drop in business leading to an unnamed creditor filing a [[winding up]] order. \n\nCash flow problems had arisen after their former owner Aviva, still a major client, terminated their supply contract, and after [[Information technology|IT]] related delays affected the implementation of a restructuring programme.

With a turnover of \u00a363m, the company had run out of cash after a drop in business leading to an unnamed creditor filing a [[winding up]] order. \n\nCash flow problems had arisen after their former owner Aviva, still a major client, terminated their supply contract, and after [[Information technology|IT]] related delays affected the implementation of a restructuring programme.

This treaty resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations. The treaty allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the [[Oregon Country]], known to the British and in Canadian history as the [[Columbia District]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and including the southern portion of its sister district [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]].\n\nThe two nations agreed to a boundary line involving the [[49th parallel north]], in part because a straight-line boundary would be easier to survey than the pre-existing boundaries based on watersheds. The treaty marked both the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the [[Continental United States]] and the United States' only permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power<!--what about the southwestern portion of Louisiana, apparently ceded to Spain in 1819? (see map)-->.

Britain ceded all territory south of the 49th parallel, including portions of the [[Red River Colony]] and [[Rupert's Land]] (comprising parts of the present states of [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]). The United States ceded the portion of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] lying north of the 49th parallel (the northernmost portion of the [[Mississippi River]] watershed, including those parts of the [[Milk River (Alberta\u2013Montana)|Milk River]], [[Poplar River (Montana\u2013Saskatchewan)|Poplar River]], and [[Big Muddy Creek (Missouri River)|Big Muddy Creek]] watersheds in modern-day [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]). This article settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]].  That earlier treaty had placed the boundary between the United States and British North America along a line extending westward from the [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Mississippi River]].  The parties did not realize that the river did not extend that far north, so such a line would never meet the river.  In fixing this problem, the 1818 treaty created a [[exclave|pene-enclave]]  of the United States, the [[Northwest Angle]], which is the small section of the present state of [[Minnesota]] that is the only part of the United States apart from Alaska lying north of the 49th parallel.\n*Article III provided for [[Condominium (international law)|joint control]] of land in the [[Oregon Country]] for ten years. Both could claim land and both were guaranteed free navigation throughout.\n*Article IV confirmed the Anglo-American Convention of 1815,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RSQyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA30&lpg=RA2-PA30&dq=Anglo-American+Convention+of+1815&source=bl&ots=fnfuPrPldi&sig=m6vV9xHJaAnsXn_O2CbW_OoZXw8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik55zu6ZDKAhUY8GMKHerkDR0Q6AEIQzAH#v=onepage&q=Anglo-American%20Convention%20of%201815&f=false Article on \"The Convention of 1815\", The Marine Journal, June 3, 1922]</ref> which regulated commerce between the two parties, for an additional ten years.\n*Article V agreed to refer differences over a U.S. claim arising from the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the [[War of 1812]], to \"some Friendly Sovereign or State to be named for that purpose.\" The U.S. claim was for return of, or compensation for, [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] that were in British territory or on British naval vessels when the treaty was signed.

This treaty resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations. The treaty allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the [[Oregon Country]], known to the British and in Canadian history as the [[Columbia District]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and including the southern portion of its sister district [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]].\n\nThe two nations agreed to a boundary line involving the [[49th parallel north]], in part because a straight-line boundary would be easier to survey than the pre-existing boundaries based on watersheds. The treaty marked both the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the [[Continental United States]] and the United States' only permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power<!--what about the southwestern portion of Louisiana, apparently ceded to Spain in 1819? (see map)-->. The British ceded all of [[Rupert's Land]] south of the 49th parallel and east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], including all of the [[Red River Colony]] south of that latitude, while the United States ceded the northernmost edge of the [[Missouri Territory]] north of the 49th parallel.\n\n==Treaty provisions==\nThe treaty name is variously cited as\n''\"Convention respecting fisheries, boundary, and the restoration of slaves\"'',<ref name=\"US Treaties in Force 2005\">{{cite book\n | last = United States Department of State\n | authorlink = United States Department of State\n | others = Compiled by the Treaty Affairs Staff, Office of the Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State.\n | title = Treaties In Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on November 1, 2007.

Britain ceded all territory south of the 49th parallel, including portions of the [[Red River Colony]] and [[Rupert's Land]] (comprising parts of the present states of [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]). The United States ceded the portion of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] lying north of the 49th parallel (the northernmost portion of the [[Mississippi River]] watershed, including those parts of the [[Milk River (Alberta\u2013Montana)|Milk River]], [[Poplar River (Montana\u2013Saskatchewan)|Poplar River]], and [[Big Muddy Creek (Missouri River)|Big Muddy Creek]] watersheds in modern-day [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]). This article settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]].  That earlier treaty had placed the boundary between the United States and British North America along a line extending westward from the [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Mississippi River]].  The parties did not realize that the river did not extend that far north, so such a line would never meet the river.  In fixing this problem, the 1818 treaty created a [[exclave|pene-enclave]]  of the United States, the [[Northwest Angle]], which is the small section of the present state of [[Minnesota]] that is the only part of the United States apart from Alaska lying north of the 49th parallel.\n*Article III provided for [[Condominium (international law)|joint control]] of land in the [[Oregon Country]] for ten years. Both could claim land and both were guaranteed free navigation throughout.\n*Article IV confirmed the Anglo-American Convention of 1815,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RSQyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA30&lpg=RA2-PA30&dq=Anglo-American+Convention+of+1815&source=bl&ots=fnfuPrPldi&sig=m6vV9xHJaAnsXn_O2CbW_OoZXw8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik55zu6ZDKAhUY8GMKHerkDR0Q6AEIQzAH#v=onepage&q=Anglo-American%20Convention%20of%201815&f=false Article on \"The Convention of 1815\", The Marine Journal, June 3, 1922]</ref> which regulated commerce between the two parties, for an additional ten years.\n*Article V agreed to refer differences over a U.S. claim arising from the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the [[War of 1812]], to \"some Friendly Sovereign or State to be named for that purpose.\" The U.S. claim was for return of, or compensation for, [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] that were in British territory or on British naval vessels when the treaty was signed.
