''The Defence'') was the main [[paramilitary]] organization of the Jewish [[Yishuv]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] between 1920 and 1948, which later became the core of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF).\n\nFormed out of previous existing militias, its original purpose was to defend Jewish settlements from Arab attacks, such as the riots of [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]], [[1921 Jaffa riots|1921]], [[1929 Palestine riots|1929]] and [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936\u20131939]]. It was under the control of the [[Jewish Agency]], the official governmental body in charge of Palestine's Jewish community during the British Mandate. Until the end of the [[Second World War]], Haganah's activities were moderate in accordance with the policy of [[havlaga]] (\"self-restraint\"), which caused the splitting of the more radical [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].The group received clandestine military support from Poland. Haganah sought cooperation with the British in the event of an [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion of Palestine through [[North African campaign|North Africa]], prompting the creation of the [[Palmach]] in 1941.\n\nWith the end of World War II and British refusal to cancel the [[1939 White Paper]]'s restrictions on Jewish immigration, the Haganah turned to [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|sabotage activities]] against the British authorities, including bombing bridges, rail lines, and ships used to deport illegal Jewish immigrants, as well as assisting in bringing Jews to Palestine in defiance of British policy. After the United Nations adopted a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan for Palestine]] in 1947, the Haganah came into the open as the biggest fighting force among Palestinian Jews, successfully overcoming Arab forces during the [[1947\u20131948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]]. Shortly after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israel's independence declaration]] and the beginning of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the Haganah was dissolved and became the official army of the state.\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\nThe evolution of Jewish defense organisations in Palestine and later Israel went from small self-defense groups active during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, to ever larger and more sophisticated ones during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], leading through the Haganah to the national army of Israel, the IDF. The evolution went step by step from [[Bar-Giora]], to [[Hashomer]], to Haganah, to IDF.\n\nThe Jewish paramilitary organisations in the [[Yishuv|New Yishuv]] (the Zionist enterprise in Palestine) started with the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904 to 1914).<ref>{{cite web|author=Speedy |url=http://thespeedymedia.blogspot.com/2011/09/idfs-history.html#.U4ei6F4ZffM |title=The Speedy Media: IDF's History |publisher=Thespeedymedia.blogspot.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref> The first such organization was [[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar-Giora]], founded in September 1907. It consisted of a small group of Jewish immigrants who guarded settlements for an annual fee. At no time did Bar-Giora have more than 100 members.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} It was converted to Hashomer ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e8}}; \"The Watchman\") in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with narrow scope, and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. During [[World War I]], the forerunners of the Haganah/IDF were the [[Zion Mule Corps]] and the [[Jewish Legion]], both of which were part of the British Army. After the [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's leadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense organization, and the Haganah was founded in June of the same year. The Haganah became a full-scale defense force after the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]] with an organized structure, consisting of three main units\u2014the [[Hish (Haganah corps)|Field Corps]], [[Guard Corps (Haganah)|Guard Corps]], and the [[Palmach]] strike force. During World War II the successor to the Jewish Legion of World War I was the [[Jewish Brigade]], which was joined by many Haganah fighters. During the 1947\u201348 civil war between the Arab and Jewish communities in what was still Mandatory Palestine, a reorganised Haganah managed to defend or wrestle most of the territory it was ordered to hold or capture. At the beginning of the ensuing 1948\u201349 full-scale conventional war against regular Arab armies, the Haganah was reorganised to become the core of the new Israel Defense Forces.\n\n===1920 and 1921 Arab riots===\nAfter the 1920 [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] and 1921 [[Jaffa riots]], the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British, to whom the [[League of Nations]] had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920, had no desire to confront local Arab gangs that frequently attacked Palestinian Jews.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/defense.html|title=The Role of Jewish Defense Organizations in Palestine (1903\u20131948)|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.il/1283-19078-EN/Dover.aspx|title=Defending the nation for 65 years|date=30 May 2013|last=Freund|first=Gabriel|last2=Sahar|first2=Raz|publisher=IDF Spokesperson}}</ref> Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect Jewish farms and [[kibbutz]]im. The first head of the Haganah was a 28 year-old named Yosef Hecht, a veteran of the [[Jewish Legion]].<ref name=\"vanCreveld\">{{cite book|title= The Sword And The Olive: A Critical History of the Israeli Defence Force|last= Van Creveld|first= Martin|isbn= 978-1586481551|url= https://books.google.com/?id=FW8SAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Public Affairs|page= 21|year= 1998}}</ref> In addition to guarding Jewish communities, the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinian Arabs. In the period between 1920\u20131929, the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination. Haganah \"units\" were very localized and poorly armed: they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim.\n\nFollowing the [[1929 Palestine riots]], the Haganah's role changed dramatically. It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements, as well as thousands of members from the cities. It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create [[hand grenade]]s and simple military equipment, transforming from an untrained militia to a capable underground army.\n\n===1931 Irgun split===\nMany Haganah fighters objected to the official policy of ''[[havlagah]]'' (restraint) that Jewish political leaders (who had become increasingly controlling of the Haganah) had imposed on the militia. Fighters had been instructed to only defend communities and not initiate counterattacks against Arab gangs or their communities. This policy appeared [[Defeatism|defeatist]] to many who believed that [[the best defense is a good offense]]. In 1931, the more militant elements of the Haganah splintered off and formed the ''Irgun Tsva'i-Leumi'' (National Military Organization), better known as \"[[Irgun]]\" (or by its Hebrew acronym, pronounced \"Etzel\").\n\n===1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 10 8e21a3d5fd8f5022e61517a641db6fa1.JPG|thumb|100px|Haganah fighters guarding [[Migdal Tzedek]], 1936]]\nDuring the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], the Haganah worked to protect British interests and to quell Arab rebellion using the [[Fosh (Haganah unit)|FOSH]], and then [[Hish (Haganah corps)|Hish]] units. At that time, the Haganah fielded 10,000 mobilized men along with 40,000 reservists. Although the British administration did not officially recognize the Haganah, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the [[Jewish Settlement Police]], [[Jewish Supernumerary Police]] and [[Special Night Squads]], which were trained and led by Colonel [[Orde Wingate]]. The battle experience gained during the training was useful in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]].\n\n===Support from Poland===\nDuring the interwar period, as part of its policy of supporting Jewish state in Palestine, with hopes of facilitating  mass Jewish emigration \u00a0[[Second Polish Republic]] provided military training and weapons to Jewish paramilitary groups, including Haganah<ref>A Marriage of Convenience: The New Zionist Organization and the Polish Government 1936-1939  Laurence Weinbaum ''In 1936, an agreement was reached between the Polish government and the Haganah in the person of its emissary, Arazi,''</ref>.Envoys from Haganah headed by Yehuda Arazi who had contact in top ranks of Polish Army and compared the national struggle of Jews to Polish one obtain weeapons from Polish government and delivered doezens of shipments. This included 2750 Mauser rifles, 225 RKM machine guns, 10,000 hand grenades, two million bullets for rifles and machine guns, and a large number of pistols with ammunition. The British exerted heavy pressure on Polish government to stop these deliveries. One of the last purchases of Arazi were two airplanes and two gliders, when he fled Poland to France, circa 500 rifles were abandoned in Warsaw warehouse<ref>The Road to September 1939: Polish Jews, Zionists, and the Yishuv on the Eve of World War II (Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry)  Brandeis University Press 2018 page 57-59</ref>Members of Haganah were also trained in military camp in [[Rembertow]] along with Betar members in the years 1931-1937; it is estimated the training courses at the  camp were attended by around 8 to 10,000 participants during their existence<ref>[http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleshow/26945?t=Betar-Hagana-i-Irgun-w-polskiej-szkole#]  \nBetar, Hagana i Irgun w polskiej szkole Polska Zbrojna 25.11.2018</ref> \u00a0\n\n\n===1939 White Paper===\nBy 1939, the British had issued the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]], which severely restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, deeply angering the Zionist leadership. [[David Ben-Gurion]], then chairman of the [[Jewish Agency]], set the policy for the Zionist relationship with the British: \"We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper, and we shall fight the White Paper as if there were no war.\"\n\nIn reaction to the White Paper, the Haganah built up the [[Palmach]] as the Haganah's elite strike force and organized illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. Approximately 100,000 Jews were brought to Palestine in over one hundred ships during the final decade of what became known as [[Aliyah Bet]]. The Haganah also organized demonstrations against British immigration quotas.\n\n===''Patria'' disaster===\n[[File:Sinking of the Patria (1940).jpg|thumb|150px|In 1940 a Haganah bomb sunk the {{SS|Patria|1913|6}}, killing 267 people]]\nIn 1940 the Haganah sabotaged the [[Patria disaster|''Patria'']], an ocean liner being used by the British to deport 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, with a bomb intended to cripple the ship.

This action, which lasted from November 1944 to February 1945, was called the ''[[The Hunting Season|Saison]]'', or the Hunting Season, and was directed against the Irgun and not the Lehi.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Future [[Jerusalem]] mayor [[Teddy Kollek]] was later revealed to be a [[Jewish Agency]] liaison officer working with the British authorities who had passed on information that led to the arrest of many Irgun activists.<ref>Andrew, Christopher (2009) ''The Defence of the Realm.

The Palmach repeatedly bombed British radar stations being used to track illegal immigrant ships, and sabotaged British ships being used to deport illegal immigrants, as well as two British landing and patrol craft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palyam.org/English/Palyam_overview_en|title=The Palyam|website=www.palyam.org}}</ref> The Palmach performed a single assassination operation in which a British official who had been judged to be excessively cruel to Jewish prisoners was shot dead.<ref>Ben-Yehuda, Nachman: ''Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice'', pages 227\u2013229</ref> The Haganah also organized the [[Birya affair]].

As Palmach members refused to participate, a unit of about 200 men from regular Haganah units was mobilized, and foiled several operations against the British, including a potentially devastating attack on the British military headquarters at Citrus House in Tel Aviv, in which a Haganah member was killed by an Irgun bomb. The Haganah also joined the search for two British sergeants abducted by the Irgun as hostages against the death sentences of three Irgun members in what became known as the [[The Sergeants affair|Sergeants' affair]]. The Jewish Agency leadership feared the damage this act would do to the Jewish cause, and also believed that holding the hostages would only jeopardize the fates of the three condemned Irgun members. The attempts to free the sergeants failed, and following the executions of the three Irgun members, the two sergeants were killed and hanged in a eucalyptus grove. However, the campaign soon disintegrated into a series of retaliatory abductions and beatings of each other's members by the Haganah and Irgun, and eventually petered out.

The Haganah played the leading role in the Yishuv's war with the Palestinian Arabs. Initially, it concentrated on defending Jewish areas from Arab raids, but after the danger of British intervention subsided as the British withdrew, the Haganah went on the offensive and seized more territory. Following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] and the start of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] on May 15, 1948, the Haganah, now the army of the new state, engaged the invading armies of the surrounding Arab states.<ref name=Bell />\n\nOn May 28, 1948, less than two weeks after the creation of the state of Israel on May 15, the provisional government created the [[Israel Defense Forces]], merging the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi, although the other two groups continued to operate independently in [[Jerusalem]] and abroad for some time after.<ref name=Bell /> The re-organisation led to several conflicts between Ben-Gurion and the Haganah leadership, including what was known as [[The Generals' Revolt]] and the dismantling of the Palmach.\n\nFamous members of the Haganah included [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Rehavam Ze'evi]], [[Dov Hoz]], [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Yigal Allon]] and Dr. [[Ruth Westheimer]].\n\nThe [[Museum of Underground Prisoners]] in [[Jerusalem]] commemorates the activity of the underground groups in the pre-state period, recreating the everyday life of those imprisoned there.\n\n===Pal-Heib Unit===\nSome [[Bedouin]]s had longstanding ties with nearby [[Jews|Jewish]] communities. They helped defend these communities in the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. During the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], some Bedouins of [[Tuba-Zangariyye|Tuba]] formed an alliance with the Haganah defending Jewish communities in the [[Upper Galilee]] against [[Syrian Republic (1930-58)|Syria]]. Some were part of a Pal-Heib unit of the Haganah. Sheik Hussein Mohammed Ali Abu Yussef of Tuba was quoted in 1948 as saying, \"Is it not written in the [[Koran]] that the ties of neighbors are as dear as those of relations?

''The Defence'') was the main [[paramilitary]] organization of the Jewish [[Yishuv]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] between 1920 and 1948, which later became the core of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF).\n\nFormed out of previous existing militias, its original purpose was to defend Jewish settlements from Arab attacks, such as the riots of [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]], [[1921 Jaffa riots|1921]], [[1929 Palestine riots|1929]] and [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936\u20131939]]. It was under the control of the [[Jewish Agency]], the official governmental body in charge of Palestine's Jewish community during the British Mandate. Until the end of the [[Second World War]], Haganah's activities were moderate in accordance with the policy of [[havlaga]] (\"self-restraint\"), which caused the splitting of the more radical [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].The group received clandestine military support from Poland. Haganah sought cooperation with the British in the event of an [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion of Palestine through [[North African campaign|North Africa]], prompting the creation of the [[Palmach]] in 1941.\n\nWith the end of World War II and British refusal to cancel the [[1939 White Paper]]'s restrictions on Jewish immigration, the Haganah turned to [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|sabotage activities]] against the British authorities, including bombing bridges, rail lines, and ships used to deport illegal Jewish immigrants, as well as assisting in bringing Jews to Palestine in defiance of British policy. After the United Nations adopted a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan for Palestine]] in 1947, the Haganah came into the open as the biggest fighting force among Palestinian Jews, successfully overcoming Arab forces during the [[1947\u20131948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]]. Shortly after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israel's independence declaration]] and the beginning of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the Haganah was dissolved and became the official army of the state.\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\nThe evolution of Jewish defense organisations in Palestine and later Israel went from small self-defense groups active during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, to ever larger and more sophisticated ones during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], leading through the Haganah to the national army of Israel, the IDF. The evolution went step by step from [[Bar-Giora]], to [[Hashomer]], to Haganah, to IDF.\n\nThe Jewish paramilitary organisations in the [[Yishuv|New Yishuv]] (the Zionist enterprise in Palestine) started with the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904 to 1914).<ref>{{cite web|author=Speedy |url=http://thespeedymedia.blogspot.com/2011/09/idfs-history.html#.U4ei6F4ZffM |title=The Speedy Media: IDF's History |publisher=Thespeedymedia.blogspot.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref> The first such organization was [[Bar-Giora (organization)|Bar-Giora]], founded in September 1907. It consisted of a small group of Jewish immigrants who guarded settlements for an annual fee. At no time did Bar-Giora have more than 100 members.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} It was converted to Hashomer ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e8}}; \"The Watchman\") in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with narrow scope, and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. During [[World War I]], the forerunners of the Haganah/IDF were the [[Zion Mule Corps]] and the [[Jewish Legion]], both of which were part of the British Army. After the [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's leadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense organization, and the Haganah was founded in June of the same year. The Haganah became a full-scale defense force after the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]] with an organized structure, consisting of three main units\u2014the [[Hish (Haganah corps)|Field Corps]], [[Guard Corps (Haganah)|Guard Corps]], and the [[Palmach]] strike force. During World War II the successor to the Jewish Legion of World War I was the [[Jewish Brigade]], which was joined by many Haganah fighters. During the 1947\u201348 civil war between the Arab and Jewish communities in what was still Mandatory Palestine, a reorganised Haganah managed to defend or wrestle most of the territory it was ordered to hold or capture. At the beginning of the ensuing 1948\u201349 full-scale conventional war against regular Arab armies, the Haganah was reorganised to become the core of the new Israel Defense Forces.\n\n===1920 and 1921 Arab riots===\nAfter the 1920 [[1920 Palestine riots|Arab riots]] and 1921 [[Jaffa riots]], the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British, to whom the [[League of Nations]] had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920, had no desire to confront local Arab gangs that frequently attacked Palestinian Jews.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/defense.html|title=The Role of Jewish Defense Organizations in Palestine (1903\u20131948)|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idf.il/1283-19078-EN/Dover.aspx|title=Defending the nation for 65 years|date=30 May 2013|last=Freund|first=Gabriel|last2=Sahar|first2=Raz|publisher=IDF Spokesperson}}</ref> Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect Jewish farms and [[kibbutz]]im. The first head of the Haganah was a 28 year-old named Yosef Hecht, a veteran of the [[Jewish Legion]].<ref name=\"vanCreveld\">{{cite book|title= The Sword And The Olive: A Critical History of the Israeli Defence Force|last= Van Creveld|first= Martin|isbn= 978-1586481551|url= https://books.google.com/?id=FW8SAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Public Affairs|page= 21|year= 1998}}</ref> In addition to guarding Jewish communities, the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinian Arabs. In the period between 1920\u20131929, the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination. Haganah \"units\" were very localized and poorly armed: they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim.\n\nFollowing the [[1929 Palestine riots]], the Haganah's role changed dramatically. It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements, as well as thousands of members from the cities. It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create [[hand grenade]]s and simple military equipment, transforming from an untrained militia to a capable underground army.\n\n===1931 Irgun split===\nMany Haganah fighters objected to the official policy of ''[[havlagah]]'' (restraint) that Jewish political leaders (who had become increasingly controlling of the Haganah) had imposed on the militia. Fighters had been instructed to only defend communities and not initiate counterattacks against Arab gangs or their communities. This policy appeared [[Defeatism|defeatist]] to many who believed that [[the best defense is a good offense]]. In 1931, the more militant elements of the Haganah splintered off and formed the ''Irgun Tsva'i-Leumi'' (National Military Organization), better known as \"[[Irgun]]\" (or by its Hebrew acronym, pronounced \"Etzel\").\n\n===1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 10 8e21a3d5fd8f5022e61517a641db6fa1.JPG|thumb|100px|Haganah fighters guarding [[Migdal Tzedek]], 1936]]\nDuring the [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], the Haganah worked to protect British interests and to quell Arab rebellion using the [[Fosh (Haganah unit)|FOSH]], and then [[Hish (Haganah corps)|Hish]] units. At that time, the Haganah fielded 10,000 mobilized men along with 40,000 reservists. Although the British administration did not officially recognize the Haganah, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the [[Jewish Settlement Police]], [[Jewish Supernumerary Police]] and [[Special Night Squads]], which were trained and led by Colonel [[Orde Wingate]]. The battle experience gained during the training was useful in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]].\n\n===Support from Poland===\nDuring the interwar period, as part of its policy of supporting Jewish state in Palestine, with hopes of facilitating  mass Jewish emigration \u00a0[[Second Polish Republic]] provided military training and weapons to Jewish paramilitary groups, including Haganah<ref>A Marriage of Convenience: The New Zionist Organization and the Polish Government 1936-1939  Laurence Weinbaum ''In 1936, an agreement was reached between the Polish government and the Haganah in the person of its emissary, Arazi,''</ref>.Envoys from Haganah headed by Yehuda Arazi who had contact in top ranks of Polish Army and compared the national struggle of Jews to Polish one obtain weeapons from Polish government and delivered doezens of shipments. This included 2750 Mauser rifles, 225 RKM machine guns, 10,000 hand grenades, two million bullets for rifles and machine guns, and a large number of pistols with ammunition. The British exerted heavy pressure on Polish government to stop these deliveries.One of the last purchases of Arazi were two airplanes and and two gliders, when he fled Poland to France, circa 500 rifles were abandoned in Warsaw warehouse<ref>The Road to September 1939: Polish Jews, Zionists, and the Yishuv on the Eve of World War II (Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry)  Brandeis University Press 2018 page 57-59</ref>Members of Haganah were also trained in military camp in [[Rembertow]] along with Betar members in the years 1931-1937; it is estimated the training courses at the  camp were attended by around 8 to 10,000 participants during their existence<ref>[http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleshow/26945?t=Betar-Hagana-i-Irgun-w-polskiej-szkole#]  \nBetar, Hagana i Irgun w polskiej szkole Polska Zbrojna 25.11.2018</ref> \u00a0\n\n\n===1939 White Paper===\nBy 1939, the British had issued the [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]], which severely restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, deeply angering the Zionist leadership. [[David Ben-Gurion]], then chairman of the [[Jewish Agency]], set the policy for the Zionist relationship with the British: \"We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper, and we shall fight the White Paper as if there were no war.\"\n\nIn reaction to the White Paper, the Haganah built up the [[Palmach]] as the Haganah's elite strike force and organized illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. Approximately 100,000 Jews were brought to Palestine in over one hundred ships during the final decade of what became known as [[Aliyah Bet]]. The Haganah also organized demonstrations against British immigration quotas.\n\n===''Patria'' disaster===\n[[File:Sinking of the Patria (1940).jpg|thumb|150px|In 1940 a Haganah bomb sunk the {{SS|Patria|1913|6}}, killing 267 people]]\nIn 1940 the Haganah sabotaged the [[Patria disaster|''Patria'']], an ocean liner being used by the British to deport 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, with a bomb intended to cripple the ship.

The Palmach repeatedly bombed British radar stations being used to track illegal immigrant ships, and sabotaged British ships being used to deport illegal immigrants, as well as two British landing and patrol craft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palyam.org/English/Palyam_overview_en|title=The Palyam|website=www.palyam.org}}</ref> The Palmach performed a single assassination operation in which a British official who had been judged to be excessively cruel to Jewish prisoners was shot dead.<ref>Ben-Yehuda, Nachman: ''Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice'', pages 227\u2013229</ref> The Haganah also organized the [[Birya affair]].

As Palmach members refused to participate, a unit of about 200 men from regular Haganah units was mobilized, and foiled several operations against the British, including a potentially devastating attack on the British military headquarters at Citrus House in Tel Aviv, in which a Haganah member was killed by an Irgun bomb. The Haganah also joined the search for two British sergeants abducted by the Irgun as hostages against the death sentences of three Irgun members in what became known as the [[The Sergeants affair|Sergeants' affair]]. The Jewish Agency leadership feared the damage this act would do to the Jewish cause, and also believed that holding the hostages would only jeopardize the fates of the three condemned Irgun members. The attempts to free the sergeants failed, and following the executions of the three Irgun members, the two sergeants were killed and hanged in a eucalyptus grove. However, the campaign soon disintegrated into a series of retaliatory abductions and beatings of each other's members by the Haganah and Irgun, and eventually petered out.

The Haganah played the leading role in the Yishuv's war with the Palestinian Arabs. Initially, it concentrated on defending Jewish areas from Arab raids, but after the danger of British intervention subsided as the British withdrew, the Haganah went on the offensive and seized more territory.

They also had main carriage of the suppression of the tyrannies, and with it the establishment of [[Spartan hegemony]].\n\nWith the reign of Anaxandridas and Ariston commences the period of certain dates, the chronology of their predecessors being doubtful and the accounts in many ways suspicious.\n\n== Family ==\nAnaxandridas II was a son of [[Leon of Sparta]]. \n\nAnaxandridas's first wife was deemed [[Infertility|barren]]. However, due to his love for her, he refused to [[divorce]] her. But, the [[ephors]] did make Anaxandridas II take a second wife.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Abbott|first=Evelyn|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oqMRAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=From the earliest times to the Ionian revolt. 1895.- pt. 2|date=1895|publisher=G.

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Gacy had a troubled relationship with his father, and seldom received his approval. His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Gacy later recollected he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}} Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}}\n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments. These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. He worked in this role for three months before returning to Chicago.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}}\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request.

He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed.

Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and turned up several suspicious items.

Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective [[Joseph R. Kozenczak]] as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

At the time of this attack, Gacy had been participating in a voluntary work program when Brisbon ran towards him and stabbed him once in the upper arm with a sharpened wire. A second death row inmate injured in the attack, William Jones, received a [[surface anatomy|superficial]] stab wound to the head.

Gacy's appeals related to issues such as the validity of the first search warrant granted to Des Plaines police on December 13, 1978, and his objection to his lawyers' insanity plea defense at his trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=344}} Gacy also contended that, although he held \"some knowledge\" of five of the murders (those of McCoy, Butkovich, Godzik, Szyc and Piest),{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}} the other 28 murders had been committed by employees who were in possession of keys to his house while he was away on business trips.\n\nIn mid-1984, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] upheld Gacy's conviction and ordered that he be executed by lethal injection on November 14.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=351}} Gacy filed an appeal against this decision, which was denied by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on March 4, 1985. The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments. These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. He worked in this role for three months before returning to Chicago.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}}\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct.

The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

The two victims murdered on the same day in May 1976 were buried alongside him, yet sequential burial patterns of three victims murdered in 1977 leave an equal possibility this particular victim may have been murdered in the spring or summer of 1977. All that is known about this youth is that he was aged between 17 and 21 years old and that he had suffered a fractured left [[clavicle|collarbone]] before his disappearance.<ref name=\"NamUs Case File 1282Dec78\">{{cite web|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/full_report/10998|title=NamUs \u2013 National Unidentified Persons Data System Case Report \u2013 10998|publisher=}}</ref>{{efn|Statements made by Gacy following his arrest leave a possibility this victim may have been murdered as early as 1974.

As a result of this contract, Gacy regularly traveled to other states to supervise construction projects and he later stated that, through both businesses (PDM Contractors and PE Systems), he often simultaneously worked on up to four construction projects,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} with almost 80 buildings being successfully remodeled in 1977 alone. In April 1977,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=179}} Michael Rossi moved out of Gacy's home; the same month, Gacy became temporarily engaged to a woman he had been dating for three months, and his fianc\u00e9e moved into his house. By mutual agreement, the engagement was called off in June of that year and his fianc\u00e9e moved out of his home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} The following month, Gacy killed a 19-year-old [[Crystal Lake, Illinois|Crystal Lake]] youth named Matthew Bowman.

Ten days after Gilroy was last seen, 19-year-old former [[U.S. Marine]] John Mowery disappeared after leaving his mother's house to walk to his own apartment. Mowery was strangled to death and buried in the northwest corner of the crawl space perpendicular to the body of William Bundy.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p 83\" />\n\nOn October 17, 21-year-old Minnesota Russell Nelson disappeared: he was last seen outside a Chicago bar. Nelson died of suffocation and was also buried in the crawl space. Less than four weeks later, 16-year-old [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]] teenager Robert Winch was murdered and buried in the crawl space, and on November 18, 20-year-old father-of-one Tommy Boling disappeared after leaving a Chicago bar.

Upon entering the car, the young man was [[chloroform]]ed and driven to the house on Summerdale, where he was raped, tortured with various instruments including lit candles and whips, and repeatedly chloroformed into unconsciousness.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=208}} He was later informed the chloroform had permanently damaged his liver. Rignall was then driven to [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]], where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. \n\nEventually, he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment.  Police were again informed of the assault but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform haze of that night, Gacy's distinctive black [[Oldsmobile 88#1977\u20131985|Oldsmobile]], the [[Kennedy Expressway]] and particular side streets. He staked out the exit on the Expressway where he knew he had been driven until\u2014in April\u2014he saw the Oldsmobile, which Rignall and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=208\u2013209}} Police issued an [[arrest warrant]], and Gacy was arrested on July 15.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=146\u2013150}} He was facing an impending trial for a battery charge for the Rignall incident when he was arrested in December for the murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=153}}\n\n====Des Plaines River: the final murders====\nBy 1978, the crawl space beneath Gacy's home could store no further bodies.<ref name=\"Michael H.

Less than three weeks later, on November 24, a 20-year-old [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]] resident, James Mazzara, disappeared after sharing Thanksgiving dinner with his family; his body was found on December 28. The cause of death in the case of Landingin was certified as suffocation through the youth's own underwear being lodged down his throat, plugging his airway{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=275}} and effectively causing him to drown in his own vomit.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=276}} Mazzara had been strangled with a ligature.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=225}}\n\n=====Murder of Robert Piest=====\n[[File:Piest1.jpg|200px|thumb|Robert Piest, whose abduction and murder ultimately led to Gacy's arrest and the discoveries upon his property.]]\nOn the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] to discuss a potential remodeling deal with store owner Phil Torf. While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}} Gacy murdered him at his house; he had been interrupted by a phone call from a business colleague while strangling him.\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 25-26</ref> \n\nThree Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When the police still wanted to meet Gacy that evening, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and turned up several suspicious items. They discovered  a [[syringe]], several badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], and a [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with holes drilled in the ends.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} \n\nThey found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but this was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} They also found several driver's licenses and male clothing too small for Gacy,  In the trash, they found a photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy.  \n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz. {{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}}\n\nThe following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}} and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in various restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his use of recreational drugs. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Detective [[Joseph R. Kozenczak]] as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. {{ISBN|978-1401095314}} p. 148</ref> Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram himself informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976 and stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

{"title_page": "Musical nationalism", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=August 2019}}\n{{Nationalism sidebar |Development}}\n\n'''Musical nationalism''' refers to the use of [[music]]al ideas or [[Motif (music)|motifs]] that are identified with a specific country, region, or ethnicity, such as [[Folk music|folk tunes]] and melodies, rhythms, and harmonies inspired by them.\n\n== History ==\nAs a musical movement, nationalism emerged early in the 19th century in connection with political independence movements, and was characterized by an emphasis on national musical elements such as the use of folk songs, folk dances or rhythms, or on the adoption of nationalist subjects for operas, symphonic poems, or other forms of music {{harv|Kennedy|2006}}. As new nations were formed in Europe, nationalism in music was a reaction against the dominance of the mainstream [[classical music|European classical tradition]] as composers started to separate themselves from the standards set by [[Italian classical music|Italian]], [[French classical music|French]], and especially [[Music of Germany#Classical music: sixteenth century to the present|German]] traditionalists {{harv|Miles|n.d.}}.{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=self-published on author's web page.|date=March 2015}}\n\nMore precise considerations of the point of origin are a matter of some dispute. One view holds that it began with the war of liberation against [[Napoleon]], leading to a receptive atmosphere in Germany for [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's]] opera ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'' (1821) and, later, [[Richard Wagner]]'s epic dramas based on Teutonic legends. At around the same time, Poland's struggle for freedom from Czarist Russia produced a nationalist spirit in the piano works and orchestral compositions such as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Fantasy on Polish Airs (Chopin)|''Fantasy on Polish Airs'']] and slightly later Italy's aspiration to independence from Austria resonated in many of the operas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] {{harv|Machlis|1979|loc=125\u201326}}. Countries or regions most commonly linked to musical nationalism include [[Russia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]].\n\n== Poland ==\n=== Jan Stefani ===\n{{interlanguage link|Jan Stefani|pl}} (1746\u20131829) composed the [[Singspiel]] ''Cud mniemany, czyli Krakowiacy i g\u00f3rali'' (The Supposed Miracle, or the Cracovians and the Highlanders), which premiered in 1794 and contains [[krakowiak]]s, [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]s, and [[mazurka]]s that were adopted as if they were Polish folk music by audiences at the 1816 revival with new music by [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]] {{harv|Goldberg|2008|loc=231\u201332}}. The suggestive lyrics of many of the songs could scarcely have been interpreted by the Polish audiences at the verge of the outbreak of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] as anything other than a call for revolution, national unity, and independence {{harv|Milewski|1999|loc=129\u201330}}. In this sense, despite his obscurity today, Stefani must be regarded as a precursor and founder of nineteenth-century musical nationalism.\n\n=== Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin ===\n{{See also|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin#Nationalism}}\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] (1810\u20131849) was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions. Joseph Machlis states, \"Poland's struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland.&nbsp;... Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the [[Romantic music|romantic era]]. The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin\" {{harv|Machlis|1963|loc=149\u201350}}. His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms. Moreover, \"During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of&nbsp;... Chopin's Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works\" {{harv|Machlis|1963|loc=150}}.\n\n=== Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko ===\n[[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]] (1819\u20131872) has become associated above all with the concept of a national style in opera. Moniuszko's opera and music as a whole is representative of 19th-century romanticism, given the extensive use by the composer of arias, recitatives and ensembles that feature strongly in his operas. The source of Moniuszko's melodies and rhythmic patterns often lies in Polish musical folklore. One of the most visibly Polish aspects of his music is in the forms he uses, including dances popular among upper classes such as polonaise and mazurka, and folk tunes and dances such as kujawiak and [[krakowiak]].\n\n=== Henryk Wieniawski ===\n[[Henryk Wieniawski]] (1835\u20131880) was another important composer using Polish folk melodies\u2014he wrote several mazurkas for solo violin and piano accompaniment, one of which being the popular \"Obertass\" in G major.\n\n=== Ignacy Jan Paderewski ===\n[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] (1860\u20131941) was a Polish pianist, composer, diplomat, and spokesman for Polish independence, who also became Prime Minister of the newly independent Poland in 1919. He wrote several pieces inspired by Polish folk music, such as polonaises and mazurkas for solo piano or his Polish Fantasy for piano and orchestra.

He is widely regarded in his homeland as the father of [[Music of the Czech Lands|Czech music]]. He is best known for the symphonic cycle ''[[M\u00e1 vlast]]'' (\"My Homeland\"), which portrays the history, legends and landscape of his native land.\n\n=== Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k ===\nAfter Smetana, [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] (1841\u20131904) was the second Czech composer to achieve worldwide recognition.

Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's own style creates a national idiom by blending elements of the classical symphonic tradition and extraneous popular musical traditions, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also wrote nine [[opera]]s, which, other than his first, have [[libretto]]s in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works.\n\n=== Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek ===\n[[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]] (1854\u20131928) was a Czech composer, musical theorist, folklorist, publicist and teacher.\n\n=== Bohuslav Martin\u016f ===\n[[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]] (1890\u20131959) is compared with [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] in his innovative incorporation of Central European [[ethnomusicology]] into his music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}<!--Who makes this comparison?--> He continued to use Bohemian and [[Moravian traditional music|Moravian folk melodies]] throughout his oeuvre, usually nursery rhymes\u2014for instance in ''[[The Opening of the Wells|Otv\u00edr\u00e1n\u00ed stud\u00e1nek]]'' (\"The Opening of the Wells\").\n\n== Norway ==\n=== Edvard Grieg ===\n[[Edvard Grieg]] (1843\u20131907) was an important Romantic era composer whose music helped establish a Norwegian national identity {{harv|Grimley|2006|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2016}}}}.\n\n== Finland ==\n=== Jean Sibelius ===\n[[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957) had strong patriotic feelings for Finland.

As part of this ambitious programme, Vasconcelos also commissioned musical compositions on nationalistic themes.

[[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813\u20131873) is considered to be the author of the first Ukrainian opera ([[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]], premi\u00e8red in 1863). Lysenko's traditions were continued by, among others, [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]] (1882\u20131922), [[Mykola Leontovych]] (1877\u20131921), [[Yakiv Stepovy]] (1883\u20131921), [[Alexander Koshetz]] (1877\u20131944), and later, [[Levko Revutsky]] (1889\u20131977).\n\nAt the same time the term \"nationalism\" is not used in Ukrainian musicology (see for example Yutsevych 2009, where such term is missing).

As new nations were formed in Europe, nationalism in music was a reaction against the dominance of the mainstream [[classical music|European classical tradition]] as composers started to separate themselves from the standards set by [[Italian classical music|Italian]], [[French classical music|French]], and especially [[Music of Germany#Classical music: sixteenth century to the present|German]] traditionalists {{harv|Miles|n.d.}}.{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=self-published on author's web page.|date=March 2015}}\n\nMore precise considerations of the point of origin are a matter of some dispute. One view holds that it began with the war of liberation against [[Napoleon]], leading to a receptive atmosphere in Germany for [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber's]] opera ''[[Der Freisch\u00fctz]]'' (1821) and, later, [[Richard Wagner]]'s epic dramas based on Teutonic legends. At around the same time, Poland's struggle for freedom from Czarist Russia produced a nationalist spirit in the piano works and orchestral compositions such as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Fantasy on Polish Airs (Chopin)|''Fantasy on Polish Airs'']] and slightly later Italy's aspiration to independence from Austria resonated in many of the operas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] {{harv|Machlis|1979|loc=125\u201326}}. Countries or regions most commonly linked to musical nationalism include [[Russia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]].\n\n== Poland ==\n=== Jan Stefani ===\n{{interlanguage link|Jan Stefani|pl}} (1746\u20131829) composed the [[Singspiel]] ''Cud mniemany, czyli Krakowiacy i g\u00f3rali'' (The Supposed Miracle, or the Cracovians and the Highlanders), which premiered in 1794 and contains [[krakowiak]]s, [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]s, and [[mazurka]]s that were adopted as if they were Polish folk music by audiences at the 1816 revival with new music by [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]] {{harv|Goldberg|2008|loc=231\u201332}}. The suggestive lyrics of many of the songs could scarcely have been interpreted by the Polish audiences at the verge of the outbreak of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] as anything other than a call for revolution, national unity, and independence {{harv|Milewski|1999|loc=129\u201330}}. In this sense, despite his obscurity today, Stefani must be regarded as a precursor and founder of nineteenth-century musical nationalism.\n\n=== Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin ===\n{{See also|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin#Nationalism}}\n[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] (1810\u20131849) was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions. Joseph Machlis states, \"Poland's struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland.&nbsp;... Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the [[Romantic music|romantic era]]. The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin\" {{harv|Machlis|1963|loc=149\u201350}}. His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms. Moreover, \"During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of&nbsp;... Chopin's Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works\" {{harv|Machlis|1963|loc=150}}.\n\n=== Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko ===\n[[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]] (1819\u20131872) has become associated above all with the concept of a national style in opera. Moniuszko's opera and music as a whole is representative of 19th-century romanticism, given the extensive use by the composer of arias, recitatives and ensembles that feature strongly in his operas. The source of Moniuszko's melodies and rhythmic patterns often lies in Polish musical folklore. One of the most visibly Polish aspects of his music is in the forms he uses, including dances popular among upper classes such as polonaise and mazurka, and folk tunes and dances such as kujawiak and [[krakowiak]].\n\n=== Henryk Wieniawski ===\n[[Henryk Wieniawski]] (1835\u20131880) was another important composer using Polish folk melodies\u2014he wrote several mazurkas for solo violin and piano accompaniment, one of which being the popular \"Obertass\" in G major.\n\n=== Ignacy Jan Paderewski ===\n[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] (1860\u20131941) was a Polish pianist, composer, diplomat, and spokesman for Polish independence, who also became Prime Minister of the newly independent Poland in 1919. He wrote several pieces inspired by Polish folk music, such as polonaises and mazurkas for solo piano or his Polish Fantasy for piano and orchestra. His last work, the monumental [[Symphony in B minor (Paderewski)|Symphony in B minor \"Polonia\"]], is a programme symphony representing the Polish struggle for independence in the early 20th century.\n\n==Italy==\n===Giuseppe Verdi===\n[[Giuseppe Verdi]] (1813\u20131901) would instill a sense of [[nationalism]] in his music.{{When|date=April 2019}}<!--Would when? Or is this merely hypothetical?--> This is evident in ''[[Nabucco]]'' with the lyrics, \"Oh mia Patria s\u00ec bella e perduta (Oh my Fatherland so beautiful and lost!)!\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} \"Viva VERDI\" would also be written as a way to support [[Italian unification]]. This translates to Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re d'Italia (Long Live [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]] King of [[Italy]]) in support of King Vittorio Emmanuele II of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Russia ==\n=== Mikhail Glinka ===\n[[Mikhail Glinka]] (1804\u20131857) was a Russian composer and and founder of the Russian nationalist school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mikhail-Glinka|title=Mikhail Glinka\nRUSSIAN COMPOSER|last=|first=|date=2020-02-11|website=ENCYCLOP\u00c6DIA BRITANNICA|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117191831/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mikhail-Glinka|archive-date=2018-01-17|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== The Mighty Five ===\n[[The Mighty Five]] (also known as the ''Mighty Handful'' and the ''New Russian School'') were five prominent 19th-century Russian composers who worked together to create a distinct Russian classical music: [[Mily Balakirev]] (the leader), [[C\u00e9sar Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]].\n\n== Czech Republic ==\n=== Bed\u0159ich Smetana ===\n[[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]] (1824\u20131884) pioneered the development of a musical style which became closely identified with his country's aspirations to independent statehood. He is widely regarded in his homeland as the father of [[Music of the Czech Lands|Czech music]]. He is best known for the symphonic cycle ''[[M\u00e1 vlast]]'' (\"My Homeland\"), which portrays the history, legends and landscape of his native land.\n\n=== Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k ===\nAfter Smetana, [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] (1841\u20131904) was the second Czech composer to achieve worldwide recognition. Following Smetana's nationalist example, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k frequently employed aspects, specifically rhythms, of the [[Moravian traditional music|folk music of Moravia]] and his native [[Bohemia]]. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's own style creates a national idiom by blending elements of the classical symphonic tradition and extraneous popular musical traditions, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also wrote nine [[opera]]s, which, other than his first, have [[libretto]]s in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works.\n\n=== Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek ===\n[[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]] (1854\u20131928) was a Czech composer, musical theorist, folklorist, publicist and teacher.\n\n=== Bohuslav Martin\u016f ===\n[[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]] (1890\u20131959) is compared with [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] in his innovative incorporation of Central European [[ethnomusicology]] into his music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}<!--Who makes this comparison?--> He continued to use Bohemian and [[Moravian traditional music|Moravian folk melodies]] throughout his oeuvre, usually nursery rhymes\u2014for instance in ''[[The Opening of the Wells|Otv\u00edr\u00e1n\u00ed stud\u00e1nek]]'' (\"The Opening of the Wells\").\n\n== Norway ==\n=== Edvard Grieg ===\n[[Edvard Grieg]] (1843\u20131907) was an important Romantic era composer whose music helped establish a Norwegian national identity {{harv|Grimley|2006|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2016}}}}.\n\n== Finland ==\n=== Jean Sibelius ===\n[[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957) had strong patriotic feelings for Finland.

In addition to being a violinist, conductor, and composer, he was also a painter. He is perhaps best known for his five symphonies and three ''Swedish Rhapsodies''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Denmark ==\n=== Niels Gade ===\n[[Niels Gade]] (1817\u20131890) was a Danish composer, conductor, violinist, organist and teacher.\n\n=== Carl Nielsen ===\n[[Carl Nielsen]] (1865\u20131931) was a Danish composer, [[Conducting|conductor]] and [[violinist]].\n\n== Romania ==\n=== George Enescu ===\n[[George Enescu]] (1881\u20131955) is considered Romania's most important composer {{harv|Malcolm and Sandu-Dediu|2015}}.

[[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]'s regime, inaugurated in 1921, provided a large budget for the Secretariat of Public Education, under the direction of [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]], who commissioned paintings for public buildings from artists such as [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. As part of this ambitious programme, Vasconcelos also commissioned musical compositions on nationalistic themes. One of the first such works was the [[Aztec]]-themed ballet ''El fuego nuevo'' (The New Fire) by [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]], composed in 1921 but not performed until 1928 {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=3\u20134}}.\n\n=== Manuel M.

Some of his music was influenced by indigenous Mexican cultures. A period of nationalistic leanings initiated in 1921 with the Aztec-themed ballet ''El fuego nuevo'' (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, ''Los cuatro soles'' (The Four Suns), in 1925.\n\n== Brazil ==\n=== Carlos Gomes ===\nThe most representative composer of Brazilian romanticism, [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] (1836\u20131896) used several references from the country's folk music and traditional themes, chiefly in his opera ''[[Il Guarany]]'' (1870).\n\n=== Heitor Villa-Lobos ===\n[[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] (1887\u20131959) traveled extensively throughout Brazil in his youth and recorded folksongs and tunes that he later used in his series ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]''{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}<!--The linked article does not mention any folk or popular tunes quoted in the Bachianas, and it would be newsworthy if anyone has shown that Villa-Lobos ever carried recording equipment with him on his travels to the hinterlands.--> and all of his ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]''{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}<!--Citations verifying folksongs in Ch\u00f4ros Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 14 needed.--> (amongst them, his ''[[Ch\u00f4ros No. 10]]'', subtitled ''Rasga o cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' after the song with words by Catulo da Paix\u00e3o Cearense and music by Anacleto de Madeiros, which Villa-Lobos quotes in the second half of this choral-orchestral piece, which employs native percussion).\n\n=== Francisco Mignone ===\n[[Francisco Mignone]] (1897\u20131986) incorporated folk rhythms and instruments into his suites ''Fantasias Brasileiras'' nos.1\u20134 (1929\u20131936), his 12 ''Brazilian Waltzes'' (1968\u20131979), ''Congada'' (1921) and ''Babalox\u00e1'' (1936), besides composing ballets based on major literary works from Brazilian literature.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n=== Joseph Parry ===\n[[Joseph Parry]] (1841\u20131903) was born in [[Wales]], but moved to the United States as a child.

In this way, they make a claim to MacDowell's identity as an American composer {{harv|Crawford|1996|loc=542}}.\n\n=== Horatio Parker ===\n[[Horatio Parker]] (1863\u20131919) was an American composer, organist and teacher.\n\n=== Charles Ives ===\n[[Charles Ives]] (1874\u20131954) was an American [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] composer, being one of the first American composers of international renown.\n\n=== Aaron Copland ===\nIronically, [[Aaron Copland]] (1900\u20131990) composed \"Mexican\" music such as ''[[El Sal\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]]'' in addition to his American nationalist works {{harv|Piston|1961|loc=25}}.\n\n==Ukraine==\nIn Ukraine the term \"Music nationalism\" ({{lang-uk|\u043c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0437\u043c}}) was coined by [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych]] in 1905 {{harv|Hrabovsky|2009|loc={{Page needed|date=June 2012}}}}. The article under this title is devoted to [[Mykola Lysenko]] who is considered to be the father of Ukrainian classical music. Ludkevych concludes that Lysenko's nationalism was inspired by those of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]] in Russian music, though western tradition, particularly German, is still significant in his music, especially instrumental.\n\nV. Hrabovsky assumes that [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych]] himself could be considered as significant nationalistic composer and musicologist thanks to his numerous composition under Ukraine-devoted titles as well as numerous paper devoted to use of Ukrainian folk songs and poetry in Ukrainian classical music {{harv|Lyudkevych|1905}}.\n\nInspiration by Ukrainian folklore could be observed even earlier, particularly in compositions by [[Maksym Berezovsky]] (1745\u20131777) (Kornii 1998, 188), [[Dmytro Bortnyansky]] (1751\u20131825) (Kornii 1998, 296), and [[Artem Vedel]] (1767\u20131808) {{harv|Kornii|1998|loc=311}}. [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813\u20131873) is considered to be the author of the first Ukrainian opera ([[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]], premi\u00e8red in 1863). Lysenko's traditions were continued by, among others, [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]] (1882\u20131922), [[Mykola Leontovych]] (1877\u20131921), [[Yakiv Stepovy]] (1883\u20131921), [[Alexander Koshetz]] (1877\u20131944), and later, [[Levko Revutsky]] (1889\u20131977).\n\nAt the same time the term \"nationalism\" is not used in Ukrainian musicology (see for example Yutsevych 2009, where such term is missing). Moreover, the article \"Music Nationalism\" by Ludkevych was prohibited in the USSR {{harv|Hrabovsky|2009|loc={{Page needed|date=June 2012}}}} and was not widely known until its publication in 1999 {{harv|Lyudkevych|1999}}.\n\n==References==\n*{{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2014}}|reference=Anon. 2014. \"[http://www.iks.hu/index.php/zoltan-kodalys-life-and-work/short-biography Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly: A Short Biography]\".
