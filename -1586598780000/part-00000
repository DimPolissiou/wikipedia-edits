She had two coal-fired boilers and a smaller auxiliary boiler, all in a single engine room amidships. Her stores could hold 100 tons of coal, which was fed to the boilers at a rate of 1.3 to 1.8 tons per hour when the ship was breaking ice.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> Like other icebreakers of her time, she was also equipped with sails which, while rarely used, remained in the inventory until the 1920s.<ref name=\"laurell68-71\" />\n\nIn many ways ''Avance'' resembled the first state-owned icebreaker of Finland, ''Murtaja'', although her bow was of improved Swedish design which increased her icebreaking capability. The angle of the stem, the first part of the ship to encounter and break the ice, was 22 degrees. Still, she was of the same outdated European design as ''Murtaja'' and thus had similar problems in difficult ice conditions. Her coal stores were also located too far in the front, resulting in an unfavourable trim at full load. Despite her shortcomings ''Avance'' was found out to be suitable for service within the archipelago.<ref name=\"laurell68-71\" />\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Apu (ship, 1899)|''Apu'' (1899 icebreaker)}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{cite book |last= Laurell |first= Seppo |title= H\u00f6yrymurtajien aika |publisher= Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6775-6}}\n\n{{Icebreakers of Finland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Apu (1899 icebreaker)}}\n[[Category:Icebreakers of Finland]]\n[[Category:1899 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Kiel]]\n[[Category:World War I naval ships of Russia]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image               = Avance.jpg\n| Ship caption             = ''Avance'' before her renaming to ''Apu''\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header              = \n| Ship country             = Finland\n| Ship flag                = {{shipboxflag|Finland|state}}\n| Ship name                =*''Avance'' (1899\u20131923)\n*''Apu'' (1923\u20131959)\n| Ship namesake            = [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for \"assistance\"\n| Ship owner               =*[[Isbrytare Aktiebolaget Avance|Isbrytare AB Avance]] (1899\u20131922)<ref name=\"turkusteamers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.turkusteamers.com/oheistietoa/muitalaivoja/avance/laiva.html|title=AVANCE|website=Turun Matkustajah\u00f6yrylaivat|accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Finnish Board of Navigation]] (1922\u20131959)<ref name=\"turkusteamers\" /><ref name=\"lloyds\" />\n| Ship operator            = \n| Ship registry            =*[[Turku]], [[Finland]] (1899\u20131922)\n*[[Helsinki, Finland]] (1922\u20131959)<ref name=\"lloyds\">[[Lloyd's Register]] of Ships, [http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30b0077.pdf 1930-1931].</ref>\n| Ship route               = \n| Ship ordered             = \n| Ship awarded             = \n| Ship builder             = [[Howaldtswerke]], [[Kiel]], [[Germany]]\n| Ship original cost       = [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 616,000\n| Ship yard number         = \n| Ship way number          = \n| Ship laid down           = \n| Ship launched            = \n| Ship christened          = \n| Ship completed           = February 1899\n| Ship acquired            = \n| Ship commissioned        = \n| Ship decommissioned      = 7 April 1959\n| Ship maiden voyage       = \n| Ship in service          = 1899\u20131959\n| Ship out of service      = \n| Ship renamed             = \n| Ship reclassified        = \n| Ship refit               = \n| Ship struck              = \n| Ship reinstated          = \n| Ship homeport            = \n| Ship motto               = \n| Ship nickname            = \n| Ship fate                = Broken up in 1959\n| Ship status              = \n| Ship identification      = \n| Ship notes               = \n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header              = \n| Header caption           = \n| Ship class               = \n| Ship type                = [[Icebreaker]]\n| Ship tonnage             =*{{GRT|568}}<ref name=\"lloyds\" />\n*{{NetT|326}}<ref name=\"lloyds\" />\n| Ship displacement        = 900 tons\n| Ship tons burthen        = \n| Ship length              =* {{convert|43.20|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} ([[Length overall|overall]])\n* {{convert|42.00|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} ([[Waterline length|waterline]])\n| Ship beam                =*{{convert|10.85|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} ([[moulded breadth|moulded]])\n*{{convert|10.35|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} (waterline)\n| Ship height              = \n| Ship draught             = {{convert|5.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} (even keel)\n| Ship draft               = \n| Ship depth               = \n| Ship hold depth          = \n| Ship decks               = \n| Ship deck clearance      = \n| Ship ramps               = \n| Ship ice class           = \n}}\n|-\n| Boilers:\n| Two coal-fired boilers and one auxiliary boiler\n|-\n| Engine:\n| [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|Triple-expansion steam engine]], {{convert|1500|ihp|kW|abbr=on}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header              = yes\n| Ship power               = \n| Ship propulsion          = \n| Ship sail plan           = Equipped with sails\n| Ship speed               = {{convert|13.5|kn}} in open water\n| Ship range               = \n| Ship endurance           = \n| Ship capacity            = \n| Ship troops              = \n| Ship complement          = \n| Ship crew                = 23<ref name=\"laurell201\">Laurell 1992, p. 201.</ref>\n| Ship time to activate    = \n| Ship armament            = \n| Ship notes               = \n}}\n|}\n\n'''''Apu''''' was a [[Finland|Finnish]] state-owned [[steamship|steam-powered]] [[icebreaker]] built by [[Howaldtswerke]] in [[Kiel]], [[Germany]], in 1899.

Still, she was of the same outdated European design as ''Murtaja'' and thus had similar problems in difficult ice conditions. Her coal stores were also located too far in the front, resulting in an unfavourable trim at full load.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

The film features the characters from the ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' books written by [[A. A. Milne]] and is the third theatrically released ''Winnie the Pooh'' feature.  In this film, [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] is ashamed of being small and clumsy and wanders off into the Hundred Acre Wood, leading all of his friends to form a search party to find him.\n''Piglet's Big Movie'' was produced by the Japanese office of [[Disneytoon Studios|DisneyToon Studios]] and the animation production was by [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Disney Animation Japan|Walt Disney Animation Japan, Inc.]] and [[Toon City|Toon City Animation, Inc.,]] [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], with additional animation provided by Gullwing Co., Ltd., additional background by Studio Fuga and digital ink and paint by T2 Studio.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Note: per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be limited to 400-700 words.-->\n[[Eeyore]], [[Rabbit (Winnie the Pooh)|Rabbit]], [[Tigger]] and [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] are working on a plan to get [[honey]] from a [[beehive]]. This involves getting the bees to move into a new hive by convincing them that Eeyore is a bee. [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] comes up to them during the attempt, but is effectively told that he is too small to help.\n\nThe plan goes awry when the bees do not fall for it, but Piglet manages to divert the bees into the new hive using a [[funnel]] and then seals the hive shut, trapping the bees.\n\nUnfortunately, noone has seen Piglet's heroism, having all been hiding from the bees. Piglet, feeling uncared for, wanders sadly away. Eventually, Pooh, Rabbit, Tigger, and Eeyore notice that Piglet is missing, assume that he has been scared off by, or kidnapped by the bees and decide to try and find him. They are joined by [[Roo]] and together the five friends search for Piglet. They are aided in this search by Piglet's [[scrapbooking|scrapbook]], in which he has drawn pictures of the adventures that he has shared with his friends. The characters use the pictures to tell the stories depicted therein.\n\nOne of the stories told is the expedition to find the [[North Pole]], where Piglet uses a long stick to save Roo (who has fallen in the river). His heroism is overlooked when he gives the stick to Pooh and tries to catch Roo, who has been catapulted into the air during the rescue attempt. [[Christopher Robin]] arrives as Roo is caught by [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|his mother]] and then credits Pooh with finding the North Pole (the stick he is holding in his paws). Back in the present, the friends regret not sharing the praise with Piglet.\n\nAnother story told is the building of [[the House at Pooh Corner]]. Here Piglet comes up with the idea to build Eeyore a house and he and Pooh are joined by Tigger to build it. Tigger and Pooh do most of the work, whilst Piglet, unintentionally, gets in the way. The final house, however, is a disaster, but Tigger and Pooh go off to tell Eeyore about the house. Unfortunately, the house is being held together by Piglet, who eventually loses his grip and the house collapses. Tigger and Pooh go to inform Eeyore of the bad news, but Piglet arrives to tell them all that the house is fine. It is revealed that he rebuilt the house himself, but the location remains as Pooh Corner, since Pooh \"would call it Pooh and Piglet Corner, if Pooh Corner didn't sound better, which it does, being smaller and more like a Corner\".\n\nBack in the present, an argument between Rabbit and Tigger ends with the scrapbook falling apart and then falling into the river. Without their guide, the friends return to Piglets house and, after a time, start to draw new pictures of Piglet and his adventures, some of which are new. Then, the friends again resolve to find their missing Piglet and go back out to find him. They come across several pictures from the scrapbook, which have floated downstream and then find the books [[Bookbinding|bindings]], suspended on a broken hollow old log, overhanging a raging [[waterfall]]. Pooh goes to retrieve it, but falls into a hole in the log. The others try to reach him, but the rescue attempt is just too short. Just as they ask who can help, Piglet arrives and helps haul Pooh to safety just as the log begins to collapse.\n\nEeyore, Rabbit, Roo and Tigger are now stood by the edge of the ravine, next to the waterfall, but the log inside which Pooh and Piglet were trapped has fallen far into the waters below. The survivors being to cry and are joined by sad-looking Pooh and Piglet, who have managed to escape. Happy, the friends take Piglet to show him their new drawings, including a large one of Piglet dressed as a [[knight]] in shining [[armour]]. The next day they hold a party, but Pooh interrupts, taking Piglet to Eeyores' house, where he has changed the sign to read Pooh and Piglet Corner; \"the least [they] could do for a little Piglet, who has done such big things!\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Fiedler]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]]\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Tigger]]\n* [[Ken Sansom]] as [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]]\n* [[Nikita Hopkins]] as [[Roo]]\n* [[Kath Soucie]] as [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]] and [[Christopher Robin]] (singing voice)\n* [[Peter Cullen]] as [[Eeyore]]\n* [[Andre Stojka]] as [[Owl (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Owl]]\n* [[Tom Wheatley]] as [[Christopher Robin]]\n\n==Production==\n''Piglet's Big Movie'' was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios|DisneyToon Studios]], [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Disney Animation Japan|Walt Disney Animation (Japan)]], [[Toon City|Toon City Animation, Inc.,]] [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Gullwing Co., Ltd, Studio Fuga, and T2 Studio.\n\n==Song List==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Piglet's Big Movie (Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Carly Simon]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    ={{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 11 September 2019|PROD}}\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 18, 2003\n| recorded   = 2002-2003\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 43:02\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records]]\n| producer   = Matt Walker, [[Carly Simon]], [[Rob Mathes]], Michael Kosarin\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/piglets-big-movie-mw0000021946| title=AllMusic review| access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref>\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n\nAmerican [[singer-songwriter]] [[Carly Simon]] wrote seven new songs for the film, and performed six of them, as well as recording her own version of the Sherman brothers' \"Winnie the Pooh\" theme song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carlysimon.com/music/soundtracks/Piglet.shtml |title=Carly Simon Official Website - Piglet's Big Movie |publisher=Web.archive.org |access-date=2015-04-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114085349/http://www.carlysimon.com/music/soundtracks/Piglet.shtml |archive-date=January 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n\"The More It Snows (Tiddely-Pom)\" features [[Jim Cummings]] and [[John Fiedler]], as Pooh and Piglet.

A year later, her best friend [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] gets her out during a prison break and tries to convince her that he does not love her. Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger. Following a costume change, Harley officially breaks up with Joker and declares her intention to make a name for herself in the criminal underworld.\n| LineColor       = B1044C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A High Bar\n| DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo<br>[[Ben Jones (Canadian cartoonist)|Ben Jones]]<br>Frank Marino\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Believing she has to join the [[Legion of Doom]] to prove herself as a supervillain, Harley attempts to make a big splash by crashing one of their criminal enterprises with Ivy's help. However, they accidentally crash a Bar Mitzvah for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s nephew, Joshua. When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants.

A year later, her best friend [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] gets her out during a prison break and tries to convince her that he does not love her. Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger. Following a costume change, Harley officially breaks up with Joker and declares her intention to make a name for herself in the criminal underworld.\n| LineColor       = B1044C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = A High Bar\n| DirectedBy      = Matt Garofalo<br>[[Ben Jones (Canadian cartoonist)|Ben Jones]]<br>Frank Marino\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Believing she has to join the [[Legion of Doom]] to prove herself as a supervillain, Harley attempts to make a big splash by crashing one of their criminal enterprises with Ivy's help. However, they accidentally crash a Bar Mitzvah for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s nephew, Joshua. When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains. Using her psychology background, Harley convinces them to stop taking abuse from Joker, forcing the clown prince to leave. Despite what happened, Harley remains committed to her goal of joining the Legion while Ivy cures the infected boys.\n| LineColor       = B1044C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = So You Need a Crew?\n| DirectedBy      = Cecilia Aranovich Hamilton\n| WrittenBy       = Jess Dweck\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|13}}\n| ShortSummary    = After Joker hijacks a robbery she was committing, Harley realizes that she needs a crew to pull off legit heists and attract the Legion of Doom's attention. However, she struggles to recruit others to her cause due to her gender and her past association with Joker. After talking with the [[Queen of Fables]], Harley decides she needs other downtrodden villains like her. She starts by recruiting disgraced [[Wonder Woman]] villain [[Doctor Psycho]], who was kicked out of the Legion of Doom by [[Lex Luthor]] for calling her and [[Giganta]] the \"[[Cunt|C word]]\" on national television instead of the \"[[Bitch (slang)|B word]].\" They next recruit Gotham City's shapeshifting thespian extraordinaire [[Clayface]] after meeting him in a bar. For their first heist, Harley decides to rob [[Maxie Zeus]]' Olympic Gold Medals as revenge for insults he made against her during her quest. Despite their initial struggles, they ultimately succeed after brutally beating up Zeus before Harley sells the medals to purchase a nuclear warhead and force the city into naming a highway after her. Upon making the news, the media begins to consider her a potential competitor for Joker, much to his ire.\n| LineColor       = B1044C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Finding Mr. Right\n| DirectedBy      = Juan Meza-Leon\n| WrittenBy       = Jess Dweck\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = In search of a nemesis, Harley goes after Batman by stealing the [[Batmobile]], but ends up with the adolescent [[Damian Wayne|Damian Wayne / Robin]], making her the laughing stock of the criminal underworld. Even worse, Robin appears on a talk show and lies about Harley agreeing to be his nemesis. After a failed attempt to get [[Superman]] to be her nemesis by kidnapping [[Lois Lane]], Harley recruits [[King Shark]] into her crew, captures Robin, threatens him into confessing he lied, then reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain to publicly humiliate him. When King Shark goes berserk after smelling blood, Batman arrives and subdues him before getting into a three-way brawl with the arriving Joker, Harley, and Ivy. Joker ends the fight by kidnapping Robin and forcing Batman to pursue them. Much to Ivy's dismay, she and Harley's crew are evicted from their apartment by their cybernetic landlord [[Sy Borgman]].

Ivy has Psycho bring them, Clayface, and King Shark into Harley's mind and meet up with her consciousness. However, she accidentally triggers her mental defenses and locks them all in. While trying to find the \"Emergency Exit\" in her subconscious, Harley discovers her indecision comes from the belief her \"origin story\" was not her decision and that she altered her memory to believe that her becoming a villain was Joker's doing. Choosing the moment she broke up with him as her true \"origin story,\" Harley cures herself somewhat. Meanwhile, Borgman finds Harley and her crew's comatose bodies and believes they committed suicide, so he takes them to an abandoned mall to cremate them. At the last minute, everyone wakes up and nearly kill Borgman. Upon seeing the mall however, Harley decides to make it their new lair.

Becoming depressed after learning Batman doesn't see him as a friend and confiscated the [[Bat-Signal]] after he abused it, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] interrogates Clayface's hand for the location of Harley's crew, but eventually bonds with it. While Harley, Clayface, and King Shark try to recover the hand, Ivy and Psycho seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic, who slandered them. King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him. While in a shoot-out with Gordon, Harley discovers the device is a teleporter when it sends her to the [[Batcave]]. Once Harley realizes she had been selfish and ignoring her teammates, she encourages Batman to help stop Gordon after he starts obsessively defending the hand. Batman reconciles with Gordon, Clayface reabsorbs his hand, and Harley and her crew escape.

Labs]]. When the Queen slaughters an innocent family who witnessed them however, the crew are horrified and kick her out. They then use the force field device to steal a weather-controlling machine from Kord Industries to ransom the city, but the Queen shows up to steal it for herself. They are interrupted by Jason Praxis, a surviving member of the family with electrical powers who seeks revenge on the Queen for their murder. Harley uses the force field device to protect the Queen, subdue Praxis, and get her to leave. Killing Praxis on her way out however, the Queen tells Harley that only villains willing to cross any line can succeed and that she'll regret letting her live. The crew later tries to program the weather machine, but accidentally cause it to self-destruct.

Luthor even allows Psycho to be reinstated so long as he does not fight any female superheroes. He secretly reveals to Ivy however that he is not actually interested in Harley and will not let her join unless she joins as well. Ivy refuses and tries to warn Harley of Luthor's treachery. Suddenly, [[Aquaman]] breaks into the Hall of Doom and beats up several villains while seeking revenge for Harley's theft, but she tricks him into breaking an aquarium and focus on saving the fish. As thanks, the Legion inducts Harley as an official member. Harley accuses Ivy of lying to her and they angrily part ways. Meanwhile, Psycho and Borgman deal with a mutant monster in their lair's basement. When Psycho tries to kill it, Borgman stops him; revealing it's his sister Mirielle, who got mutated because of him. Psycho uses his powers to let the siblings communicate and reconcile, but Mirielle is released into the streets and goes on a rampage.

Harley reconciles with Ivy and promises to help her attack an environmentally unfriendly company called Planetwide Pavers. Unlike Harley however, her crew are treated as lowly henchmen and Bane hires them to help him get revenge on a clerk for always getting his name wrong. Harley attends a dinner date with Joker to try to persuade him to convince Luthor to elevate her crew's status, but she has so much fun with him, she forgets to tell him. While planting a bomb for Bane, King Shark ends up being hospitalized after the former loses patience and detonates it early. When Batman pursues them, Joker kisses Harley before shoving her out of his helicopter to slow the dark knight down. While the crew and Ivy stand vigil over King Shark in the hospital, they see an out-of-context image of Joker and Harley kissing on the news.

Her father claims he owes a loan shark money, so Harley beats him and his goons to force them to leave her father alone. Meanwhile, Ivy finds herself trapped in a laboratory, but manages to use a dandelion to tell her sentient plant Frank to get Harley's help. She's later shocked to find that Scarecrow's her captor. Another assassin attacks and kills Harley's grandfather before she defeats her. Her parents suddenly attack her, explaining that someone put a bounty on her and they aim to collect. An enraged Harley defeats them, but chooses to spare them as they aren't worth it. Just as she collapses from her injuries, Frank finds her and tells her Ivy is in trouble.

Psycho brings the crew into Ivy's head while Borgman protects their bodies. Inside her head, Frank informs them the only way to save Ivy is to destroy the thing she fears the most, which appears in the form of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]. Harley defeats the Reaper, but sees her face under the hood before they wake up. Scarecrow tries to escape on the Harley Quinn Highway, but Borgman transforms into a car so the crew can give chase. Amidst said chase, Ivy tells Harley her fear is being abandoned by someone she trusted and that she resents her for being with the Joker instead of helping her. Harley attempts to make amends by blowing off the head of her statue to stop Scarecrow, but he succeeds in poisoning the Gotham Reservoir and infecting the city's water supply with Ivy's pheromones; turning most of Gotham's trees into violent monsters.\n| LineColor       = B1044C\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Devil's Snare\n| DirectedBy      = Juan Meza-Leon\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|14}}\n| ShortSummary    = Scarecrow starts crop-dusting fear toxin around Gotham's perimeters to force thousands of civilians towards the park with the murderous trees. As Batman tracks him down, the [[Justice League]] arrives to stop the trees. They assume Harley's crew is behind the attacks and attempt to send them to the [[Phantom Zone]], but Ivy uses Wonder Woman's lasso to prove them wrong. Suddenly, the Queen of Fables traps the League in her fairy tale book before using a beanstalk to send Harley and her crew to be attacked by a giant [[cyclops]]. With Kite Man's help, they are able to return to the ground safely. Just then, Joker appears with a large tower and destroys the Hall of Doom as he enacts his plans to take over Gotham City and orders the Queen to kill Harley and her team.

His takeover largely complete, Joker spends the next week subjugating Gotham and brutally torturing Batman and the crew, only to get bored. Hoping to help, Scarecrow unmasks Batman, but Joker kills him for ruining the \"mystery\". Meanwhile, Harley revisits Ivy's grave, where Frank and Kite Man tell her the crew's going to be publicly executed, so she surrenders herself in exchange for their lives. Once her crew's safe, Harley tries to kill Joker, but he gets the upper hand. Instead of killing her, Joker decides to drop her in acid that will render her \"normal.\" At the last minute, a resurrected Ivy saves Harley and drops Joker in the acid, though not before he destroys his tower and Gotham.

Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham.

Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself.

The term applies to raster [[digital image]]s, film images, and other types of images. Higher resolution means more image detail.\n\nImage resolution can be measured in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be [[Visual perception|visibly]] ''resolved''.  Resolution units can be tied to physical sizes (e.g. lines per mm, lines per inch), to the overall size of a picture (lines per picture height, also known simply as lines, [[TV lines]], or TVL), or to angular subtense.  Line pairs are often used instead of lines; a line pair comprises a dark line and an adjacent light line. A line is either a dark line or a light line. A resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm).  [[Photographic lens]] and [[Photographic film|film resolution]] are most often quoted in line pairs per millimeter.\n\n==Resolution of digital images==\n\nThe resolution of digital cameras can be described in many different ways.\n\n===Pixel [[Resolution of singularities|resolution]]===<!-- This section is linked from [[PlayStation Eye]] -->\nThe term ''resolution'' is often considered equivalent to [[pixel]] count in digital imaging, though international standards in the [[digital camera]] field specify it should instead be called \"Number of Total Pixels\" in relation to image sensors, and as \"Number of Recorded Pixels\" for what is fully captured. Hence, [[CIPA DCG-001]] calls for notation such as  \"Number of Recorded Pixels 1000 \u00d7 1500\".<ref>[http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DCG-001_E.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202125644/http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DCG-001_E.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }} Guideline for Noting Digital Camera Specifications in Catalogs. \"The term 'Resolution' shall not be used for the number of recorded pixels\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126202022/http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ANSI%2FI3A+IT10%2E7000%2D2004 ANSI/I3A IT10.7000\u20132004]  Photography \u2013 Digital Still Cameras \u2013 Guidelines for Reporting Pixel-Related Specifications</ref> According to the same standards, the \"Number of Effective Pixels\" that an [[image sensor]] or [[digital camera]] has is the count of [[pixel]] sensors that contribute to the final image (including pixels not in said image but nevertheless support the image filtering process), as opposed to the number of ''total pixels'', which includes unused or light-shielded pixels around the edges.\n\nAn image of N pixels height by M pixels wide can have any resolution less than N lines per picture height, or N TV lines.  But when the pixel counts are referred to as \"resolution\", the convention is to describe the ''pixel resolution'' with the set of two positive [[integer]] numbers, where the first number is the number of pixel columns (width) and the second is the number of pixel rows (height), for example as ''7680 \u00d7 6876''. Another popular convention is to cite resolution as the total number of pixels in the image, typically given as number of [[megapixel]]s, which can be calculated by multiplying pixel columns by pixel rows and dividing by one million. Other conventions include describing pixels per length unit or pixels per area unit, such as [[pixels per inch]] or per square inch.  None of these ''pixel resolutions'' are true resolutions{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=August 2017}}, but they are widely referred to as such; they serve as [[upper bound]]s on image resolution.\n\nBelow is an illustration of how the same image might appear at different pixel resolutions, if the pixels were poorly rendered as sharp squares (normally, a smooth image reconstruction from pixels would be preferred, but for illustration of pixels, the sharp squares make the point better).\n\n[[Image:Resolution illustration.png]]\n\nAn image that is 2048 pixels in width and 1536 pixels in height has a total of 2048&times;1536 = 3,145,728 pixels or 3.1 megapixels.  One could refer to it as 2048 by 1536 or a 3.1-megapixel image. The image would be a very low quality image (72ppi) if printed at about 28.5 inches wide, but a very good quality (300ppi) image if printed at about 7 inches wide.\n\nThe number of photodiodes in a color [[digital camera]] image sensor is often a multiple of the number of pixels in the image it produces, because information from an array of color [[image sensors]] is used to reconstruct the color of a single pixel. The image has to be interpolated or [[demosaic]]ed to produce all three colors for each output pixel.\n\n=== Spatial resolution ===\n{{main|Spatial resolution}}\n{{further|Focus (optics)}}\n\nThe terms blurriness and sharpness are used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images.\n\nSpatial resolution in radiology refers to the ability of the imaging modality to differentiate two objects. Low spatial resolution techniques will be unable to differentiate between two objects that are relatively close together.\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1951 USAF Resolution Test Target.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[1951 USAF resolution test chart|1951 USAF resolution test target]] is a classic test target used to determine spatial resolution of imaging sensors and imaging systems.]] -->\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Image at left has a higher ''pixel count'' than the one to the right, but is still of worse spatial resolution.\n| align     = right\n| image1    = Matakis - blurred.jpg\n| width1    = 200\n| image2    = MARTAKIS1.jpg\n| width2    = 200\n}}\n\nThe measure of how closely lines can be resolved in an image is called spatial resolution, and it depends on properties of the system creating the image, not just the pixel resolution in [[pixels per inch]] (ppi). For practical purposes the clarity of the image is decided by its spatial resolution, not the number of pixels in an image. In effect, spatial resolution refers to the number of ''independent'' pixel values per unit length.\n\nThe spatial resolution of consumer displays range from 50 to 800 pixel lines per inch.  With scanners, [[optical resolution]] is sometimes used to distinguish spatial resolution from the number of pixels per inch.\n\nIn [[remote sensing]], spatial resolution is typically limited by [[diffraction limit|diffraction]], as well as by aberrations, imperfect focus, and atmospheric distortion.   The [[ground sample distance]] (GSD) of an image, the pixel spacing on the Earth's surface, is typically considerably smaller than the resolvable spot size.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], one often measures spatial resolution in data points per arcsecond subtended at the point of observation, because the physical distance between objects in the image depends on their distance away and this varies widely with the object of interest.  On the other hand, in [[electron microscopy]], line or fringe resolution refers to the minimum separation detectable between adjacent parallel lines (e.g. between planes of atoms), whereas ''point resolution'' instead refers to the minimum separation between adjacent points that can be both detected ''and interpreted'' e.g. as adjacent columns of atoms, for instance.  The former often helps one detect periodicity in specimens, whereas the latter (although more difficult to achieve) is key to visualizing how individual atoms interact.\n\nIn Stereoscopic 3D images, spatial resolution could be defined as the spatial information recorded or captured by two viewpoints of a stereo camera (left and right camera).\n\n=== Spectral resolution ===\n{{main|ICC profile}}\nPixel encoding limit the information stored in a digital image, and the term color profile is used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images. \n\nSpectral resolution is the ability to resolve spectral features and bands into their separate components. [[Color image]]s distinguish light of different [[visible spectrum|spectra]]. [[Multispectral image]]s can resolve even finer differences of spectrum or [[wavelength]] by measuring and storing more than the traditional 3 of common RGB color images.\n\n=== Temporal resolution ===\n{{main|Frame rate}}\nTemporal resolution (TR) refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to time. \n\n[[Movie camera]]s and [[high-speed camera]]s can resolve events at different points in time. The time resolution used for movies is usually 24 to 48 [[frames per second]] (frames/s), whereas high-speed cameras may resolve 50 to 300 frames/s, or even more.\n\nMany cameras and displays offset the color components relative to each other or mix up temporal with spatial resolution:\n<gallery>\nFile:Bayer matrix.svg|[[digital camera]] (Bayer [[color filter array]])\nFile:Lcd display dead pixel.jpg|[[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] (Triangular [[pixel geometry]])\nFile:Shadow mask closeup cursor.jpg|[[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (shadow mask)\n</gallery>\n\nIn quantum physics there is a trade-off between temporal resolution of a measurement and its spatial resolution due to the [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]]; similarly, a time/space trade-off is an inherent property of the [[Fourier transform]] used to visualise audio.\n\n=== Radiometric resolution ===\n{{main|Color depth}}\n[[Radiometric]] resolution determines how finely a system can represent or distinguish differences of [[luminous intensity|intensity]], and is usually expressed as a number of levels or a number of [[bit]]s, for example 8 bits or 256 levels that is typical of computer image files. The higher the radiometric resolution, the better subtle differences of intensity or [[reflectivity]] can be represented, at least in theory. In practice, the effective radiometric resolution is typically limited by the noise level, rather than by the number of bits of representation.\n\n==Resolution in various media==\nThis is a list of traditional, analog horizontal resolutions for various media.

The term applies to raster [[digital image]]s, film images, and other types of images. Higher resolution means more image detail.\n\nImage resolution can be measured in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be [[Visual perception|visibly]] ''resolved''.  Resolution units can be tied to physical sizes (e.g. lines per mm, lines per inch), to the overall size of a picture (lines per picture height, also known simply as lines, [[TV lines]], or TVL), or to angular subtense.  Line pairs are often used instead of lines; a line pair comprises a dark line and an adjacent light line. A line is either a dark line or a light line. A resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm).  [[Photographic lens]] and [[Photographic film|film resolution]] are most often quoted in line pairs per millimeter.\n\n==Resolution of digital images==\n\nThe resolution of digital cameras can be described in many different ways.\n\n===Pixel [[Resolution of singularities|resolution]]===<!-- This section is linked from [[PlayStation Eye]] -->\nThe term ''resolution'' is often considered equivalent to [[pixel]] count in digital imaging, though international standards in the [[digital camera]] field specify it should instead be called \"Number of Total Pixels\" in relation to image sensors, and as \"Number of Recorded Pixels\" for what is fully captured. Hence, [[CIPA DCG-001]] calls for notation such as  \"Number of Recorded Pixels 1000 \u00d7 1500\".<ref>[http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DCG-001_E.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202125644/http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DCG-001_E.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }} Guideline for Noting Digital Camera Specifications in Catalogs. \"The term 'Resolution' shall not be used for the number of recorded pixels\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126202022/http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ANSI%2FI3A+IT10%2E7000%2D2004 ANSI/I3A IT10.7000\u20132004]  Photography \u2013 Digital Still Cameras \u2013 Guidelines for Reporting Pixel-Related Specifications</ref> According to the same standards, the \"Number of Effective Pixels\" that an [[image sensor]] or [[digital camera]] has is the count of [[pixel]] sensors that contribute to the final image (including pixels not in said image but nevertheless support the image filtering process), as opposed to the number of ''total pixels'', which includes unused or light-shielded pixels around the edges.\n\nAn image of N pixels height by M pixels wide can have any resolution less than N lines per picture height, or N TV lines.  But when the pixel counts are referred to as \"resolution\", the convention is to describe the ''pixel resolution'' with the set of two positive [[integer]] numbers, where the first number is the number of pixel columns (width) and the second is the number of pixel rows (height), for example as ''7680 \u00d7 6876''. Another popular convention is to cite resolution as the total number of pixels in the image, typically given as number of [[megapixel]]s, which can be calculated by multiplying pixel columns by pixel rows and dividing by one million. Other conventions include describing pixels per length unit or pixels per area unit, such as [[pixels per inch]] or per square inch.  None of these ''pixel resolutions'' are true resolutions{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=August 2017}}, but they are widely referred to as such; they serve as [[upper bound]]s on image resolution.\n\nBelow is an illustration of how the same image might appear at different pixel resolutions, if the pixels were poorly rendered as sharp squares (normally, a smooth image reconstruction from pixels would be preferred, but for illustration of pixels, the sharp squares make the point better).\n\n[[Image:Resolution illustration.png]]\n\nAn image that is 2048 pixels in width and 1536 pixels in height has a total of 2048&times;1536 = 3,145,728 pixels or 3.1 megapixels.  One could refer to it as 2048 by 1536 or a 3.1-megapixel image. The image would be a very low quality image (72ppi) if printed at about 28.5 inches wide, but a very good quality (300ppi) image if printed at about 7 inches wide.\n\nThe number of photodiodes in a color [[digital camera]] image sensor is often a multiple of the number of pixels in the image it produces, because information from an array of color [[image sensors]] is used to reconstruct the color of a single pixel. The image has to be interpolated or [[demosaic]]ed to produce all three colors for each output pixel.\n\n=== Spatial resolution ===\n{{main|Spatial resolution}}\n{{further|Focus (optics)}}\n\nThe terms blurriness and sharpness are used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images.\n\nSpatial resolution in radiology refers to the ability of the imaging modality to differentiate two objects. Low spatial resolution techniques will be unable to differentiate between two objects that are relatively close together.\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1951 USAF Resolution Test Target.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[1951 USAF resolution test chart|1951 USAF resolution test target]] is a classic test target used to determine spatial resolution of imaging sensors and imaging systems.]] -->\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Image at left has a higher ''pixel count'' than the one to the right, but is still of worse spatial resolution.\n| align     = right\n| image1    = Matakis - blurred.jpg\n| width1    = 200\n| image2    = MARTAKIS1.jpg\n| width2    = 200\n}}\n\nThe measure of how closely lines can be resolved in an image is called spatial resolution, and it depends on properties of the system creating the image, not just the pixel resolution in [[pixels per inch]] (ppi). For practical purposes the clarity of the image is decided by its spatial resolution, not the number of pixels in an image. In effect, spatial resolution refers to the number of ''independent'' pixel values per unit length.\n\nThe spatial resolution of consumer displays range from 50 to 800 pixel lines per inch.  With scanners, [[optical resolution]] is sometimes used to distinguish spatial resolution from the number of pixels per inch.\n\nIn [[remote sensing]], spatial resolution is typically limited by [[diffraction limit|diffraction]], as well as by aberrations, imperfect focus, and atmospheric distortion.   The [[ground sample distance]] (GSD) of an image, the pixel spacing on the Earth's surface, is typically considerably smaller than the resolvable spot size.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], one often measures spatial resolution in data points per arcsecond subtended at the point of observation, because the physical distance between objects in the image depends on their distance away and this varies widely with the object of interest.  On the other hand, in [[electron microscopy]], line or fringe resolution refers to the minimum separation detectable between adjacent parallel lines (e.g. between planes of atoms), whereas ''point resolution'' instead refers to the minimum separation between adjacent points that can be both detected ''and interpreted'' e.g. as adjacent columns of atoms, for instance.  The former often helps one detect periodicity in specimens, whereas the latter (although more difficult to achieve) is key to visualizing how individual atoms interact.\n\nIn Stereoscopic 3D images, spatial resolution could be defined as the spatial information recorded or captured by two viewpoints of a stereo camera (left and right camera).\n\n=== Spectral resolution ===\n{{main|ICC profile}}\nPixel encoding limit the information stored in a digital image, and the term color profile is used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images. \n\nSpectral resolution is the ability to resolve spectral features and bands into their separate components. [[Color image]]s distinguish light of different [[visible spectrum|spectra]]. [[Multispectral image]]s can resolve even finer differences of spectrum or [[wavelength]] by measuring and storing more than the traditional 3 of common RGB color images.\n\n=== Temporal resolution ===\n{{main|Frame rate}}\nTemporal resolution (TR) refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to time. \n\n[[Movie camera]]s and [[high-speed camera]]s can resolve events at different points in time. The time resolution used for movies is usually 24 to 48 [[frames per second]] (frames/s), whereas high-speed cameras may resolve 50 to 300 frames/s, or even more.\n\nMany cameras and displays offset the color components relative to each other or mix up temporal with spatial resolution:\n<gallery>\nFile:Bayer matrix.svg|[[digital camera]] (Bayer [[color filter array]])\nFile:Lcd display dead pixel.jpg|[[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] (Triangular [[pixel geometry]])\nFile:Shadow mask closeup cursor.jpg|[[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (shadow mask)\n</gallery>\n\nIn quantum physics there is a trade-off between temporal resolution of a measurement and its spatial resolution due to the [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]]; similarly, a time/space trade-off is an inherent property of the [[Fourier transform]] used to visualise audio.\n\n=== Radiometric resolution ===\n{{main|Color depth}}\n[[Radiometric]] resolution determines how finely a system can represent or distinguish differences of [[luminous intensity|intensity]], and is usually expressed as a number of levels or a number of [[bit]]s, for example 8 bits or 256 levels that is typical of computer image files. The higher the radiometric resolution, the better subtle differences of intensity or [[reflectivity]] can be represented, at least in theory. In practice, the effective radiometric resolution is typically limited by the noise level, rather than by the number of bits of representation.\n\n==Resolution in various media==\nThis is a list of traditional, analog horizontal resolutions for various media.  The list only includes popular formats, not rare formats, and all values are approximate, because the actual quality can vary machine-to-machine or tape-to-tape. For ease-of-comparison, all values are for the NTSC system. (For PAL systems, replace 480 with 576.)

The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and the treacherous [[Gollum]].

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters.<ref name=\"FOTR SEE\" />\n\nEarlier versions of the script included additional characters like Fatty Bolger, Glorfindel, Elladan, Elrohir, Erkenbrand, Imrahil and Forlong.<ref name=\"quest\">{{Cite book |author=Brian Sibley |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-717558-2 |location=London |pages=329\u201387 |chapter=Quest for the Ring|author-link=Brian Sibley}}</ref> At one point, Jackson even considered reintroducing Tom Bombadil in a cameo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugEFwc5bMB8&list=PLCZgoww3m_249koI9ngypkNy5kKy3J3SX&index=70 |title=Philippa Boyens interview in Comic-Con, 2014 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> Gimli was going to swear throughout the films, and Arwen would join the Fellowship in Rohan and share a nude scene with Aragorn in the pools of the Glittering Caves.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Anything You Can Imagine |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=200\u2013203}}</ref>\n\nJackson hired long-time collaborator [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] to lead [[Weta Workshop]] on five major design elements: armour, weapons, [[prosthetic makeup]], creatures, and miniatures.

With Jackson's future films, motion-capture technology had been pushed so far that it became referred to as \"digital makeup\", although it was later clarified that during ''The Lord of the Rings'' period, it was still fairly reliant on the CG animators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://otherthings.com/blog/2014/05/randy-cook-speaks-out-on-digital-makeup/|title=RANDY COOK SPEAKS OUT ON \u201cDIGITAL MAKEUP\u201d|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] for all three films was conducted concurrently in many locations within [[Protected areas of New Zealand|New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks]].

He was also finally given a chance to remake ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' in 2005.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.
