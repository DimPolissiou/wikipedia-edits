As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consists mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America but never was. The group, having seemingly given up on the UK market, only included tour dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\". The second time Queen appeared was on the show's [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale in May 2009, performing \"We Are the Champions\" with finalists [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Kris Allen]].

Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them.

He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town.

When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it.

The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton.

The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release.

While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\".

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

Originally known as the \"WWF Hall of Fame\", it was created in 1993, when [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] was posthumously inducted with a video package. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual [[King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the [[Survivor Series]] event. After an eight year hiatus, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with [[WrestleMania]] ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014 the entire ceremonies have aired on the [[WWE Network]].\n\nAs of 2019, there have been 204 inductees, with 113 wrestlers inducted individually,  37 Legacy Inductees, 15 group inductions (consisting of 43 wrestlers within those groups), 10 celebrities and five Warrior Award recipients, whilst 57 members have been inducted posthumously. Four wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): [[Ric Flair]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Bret Hart]], with four more ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Sean Waltman]]) to receive a second induction in 2020.<ref name=\"HoF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/|title=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe WWF Hall of Fame was created in 1993.

Originally known as the \"WWF Hall of Fame\", it was created in 1993, when [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] was posthumously inducted with a video package. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual [[King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the [[Survivor Series]] event. After an eight year hiatus, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with [[WrestleMania]] ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014 the entire ceremonies have aired on the [[WWE Network]].\n\nAs of 2019, there have been 204 inductees, with 113 wrestlers inducted individually,  37 Legacy Inductees, 15 group inductions (consisting of 43 wrestlers within those groups), 10 celebrities and five Warrior Award recipients, whilst 57 members have been inducted posthumously. Four wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): [[Ric Flair]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Bret Hart]], with four more ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Sean Waltman]]) to receive a second induction in 2020.<ref name=\"HoF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/|title=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe WWF Hall of Fame was created in 1993.

Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, humor and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and has grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fourth-highest-grossing animated film]] (behind the 2019 version of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Frozen II]]'', and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'') and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th-highest-grossing film]] of all time, along with being the third Pixar film to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], losing both to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nFollowing immediately after the events of the [[The Incredibles|first film]], the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]] and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]] battle the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]] who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs and other superheroes without financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s love interest [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], a wealthy businessman. He and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]] propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nDue to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious [[supervillain]] called the Screenslaver, who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images via TV screens. After preventing him from destroying a crowded runaway [[commuter rail|commuter train]], and thwarting his attempt to assassinate a diplomat, she tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and following a brief struggle, unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust''. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to save her father when he was murdered by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotized superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by their father, and reach Winston's hydrofoil yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air designed to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ''Everjust'' from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the [[police]], Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled Incredimobile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n* [[Craig T.

This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones, nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults. This also allowed him to keep Jack-Jack as an infant with an array of powers, which Bird likened to how [[Language acquisition|infants are able to understand numerous languages]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-incredibles-2-starts-exactly-where-the-origina/1100-6458277/ |title=Why Incredibles 2 Starts Exactly Where The Original Ended |first=Michael |last=Rougeau |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> While the plot of the 2005 follow-up [[video game]] to ''The Incredibles'', ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer]]'', begins at that same point of time,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/14/15973580/the-incredibles-2-opening-pixar-d23 |title=The Incredibles 2 picks up right where the original left off |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=July 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> the film discards the game's continuity.

Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it.

He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else.\" Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles.

Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, humor and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and has grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fourth-highest-grossing animated film]] (behind the 2019 version of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Frozen II]]'', and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'') and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th-highest-grossing film]] of all time, along with being the third Pixar film to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], losing both to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nFollowing immediately after the events of the [[The Incredibles|first film]], the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]] and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]] battle the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]] who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs and other superheroes without financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s love interest [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], a wealthy businessman. He and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]] propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nDue to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious [[supervillain]] called the Screenslaver, who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images via TV screens. After preventing him from destroying a crowded runaway [[commuter rail|commuter train]], and thwarting his attempt to assassinate a diplomat, she tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and following a brief struggle, unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust''. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to save her father when he was murdered by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotized superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by their father, and reach Winston's hydrofoil yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air designed to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ''Everjust'' from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the [[police]], Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled Incredimobile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n* [[Craig T.

Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004.
