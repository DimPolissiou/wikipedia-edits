As a result, the disc was released in October 2015 under the name ''[[Angels & Ghosts]]'' and in its support the musicians released two singles - \"All this and nothing\" and \"Shine\". In addition, a mini-tour was organized in support of the new album (for the first time with [[Dave Gahan|Gahan]]), in which songs from the current album, ''[[The Light the Dead See]]'' were performed as well as some [[Depeche Mode]]'s and the vocalist\u2019s solo songs in encore.\n\nShortly after a series of concerts in support of the album ''[[Angels & Ghosts]]'', the Machin and Glover had released the album ''[[Kubrick (album)|Kubrick]]'' consisting of completely instrumental eight tracks (for the first time in the project\u2019s history). After that the collective suspended its activities.\nAt the start of 2020, Dave Gahan was involved with North East of England musician, Rob Marshall's Humanist project, guesting vocals on the track, \"Shock Collar\". In a two part interview on Radio 6 in February 2020 relating to Humanist, Gahan also stated that he would be working with Soulsavers again, with a view to releasing an album by the end of 2020.

He was knighted in 1909.\n\nGalton produced over 340 papers and books. He also created the statistical concept of [[correlation]] and widely promoted [[regression toward the mean]]. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]], and introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|survey]]s for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies.

He also conducted research on the [[Efficacy of prayer|power of prayer]], concluding it had none due to its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for.{{sfn|Galton|1872|pp=125-135}} His quest for the scientific principles of diverse phenomena extended even to the optimal method for making tea.{{sfn|Galton|1855|p=208}}\n\nAs the initiator of scientific [[meteorology]], he devised the first [[weather map]], proposed a theory of [[anticyclone]]s, and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale.<ref name=\"scienceworld.wolfram.com\" /> He also invented the [[Dog whistle|Galton Whistle]] for testing differential hearing ability.{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}} He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin.{{sfn|Darwin|1887|p=5}}\n\n==Early life==\nGalton was born at \"The Larches\", a large house in the [[Sparkbrook]] area of [[Birmingham]], England, built on the site of \"Fair Hill\", the former home of [[Joseph Priestley]], which the [[botanist]] [[William Withering]] had renamed. He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent [[Erasmus Darwin]]. His father was [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], son of [[Samuel \"John\" Galton]]. The Galtons were [[Quaker]] gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.\n\nHe was cousin of [[Douglas Strutt Galton]] and half-cousin of [[Charles Darwin]]. Both families had Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham, which included [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]], [[James Watt|Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]. Both families were known for their literary talent. Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse. Galton's aunt [[Mary Anne Galton]] wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her autobiography detailed the environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.\n\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Octavius Oakley.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Galton by [[Octavius Oakley]], 1840]]\n\nGalton was a [[child prodigy]]&nbsp;\u2013 he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including [[Shakespeare]] for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}} Galton attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], but chafed at the narrow classical curriculum and left at 16.{{sfn|Cowan|2005}} His parents pressed him to enter the medical profession, and he studied for two years at [[Birmingham General Hospital]] and [[King's College London]] [[Medical School]]. He followed this up with mathematical studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge]], from 1840 to early 1844.<ref name=\"ACAD\" />\n\nAccording to the records of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], it was in February 1844 that Galton became a [[freemason]] at the ''Scientific'' lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A note in the record states: \"Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845\".<ref name=\"Freemasonry\" /> One of Galton's masonic certificates from ''Scientific'' lodge can be found among his papers at [[University College, London]].<ref name=\"MerringtonGolden1976\" />\n\nA [[nervous breakdown]] prevented Galton's intent to try for honours. He elected instead to take a \"poll\" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=5}} (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He briefly resumed his medical studies but the death of his father in 1844 left him emotionally destitute, though financially independent,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention.\n\nIn his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a notable solo trip through Eastern Europe to [[Constantinople]], before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846, he went to [[Egypt]] and travelled up the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]], and from there to [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]] and down the [[Jordan]].\n\nIn 1850 he joined the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult [[exploration|expedition]] into then little-known [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). He wrote a book on his experience, \"Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa\".{{sfn|Galton|1853}} He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=16}} This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling ''The Art of Travel'', a handbook of practical advice for the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print.\n\n==Middle years==\n[[File:Francis_Galton_1850s.jpg|thumb|Galton in the 1850s]]\nGalton was a [[polymath]] who made important contributions in many fields of science, including [[meteorology]] (the [[anti-cyclone]] and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), [[psychology]] ([[synaesthesia]]), [[biology]] (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and [[criminology]] (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his [[penchant]] for counting and measuring. Galton prepared the first [[weather map]] published in ''[[The Times]]'' (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.<ref name=\"meteor\" />\n\nHe became very active in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=29}} He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.\n\n[[James McKeen Cattell]], a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\nIn 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.{{sfn|Hergenhahn|Henley|2013|p=288}}\n\nIn 1873, Galton wrote a controversial letter to ''[[The Times]]'' titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.<ref name=\"TheTimes1873\" />\n\n==Heredity and eugenics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}<!--first 4 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|Galton in his later years]]\nThe publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life.{{sfn|Forrest|1974|page=84}} He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on \"Variation under Domestication\", concerning [[animal breeding]].\n\nGalton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In doing so, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.\n\nGalton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was [[hereditary]], and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of [[historiometry]]. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869.{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}} Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the [[inheritance of intelligence|inheritance of abilities]].\n\nGalton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper ''The history of twins'' in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of [[behaviour genetics]], which relies heavily on [[twin studies]]. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed [[adoption study|adoption studies]], including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.\n\nGalton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation's citizens, and their [[reproductive success]]. In ''Hereditary Genius'', he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:\n\n{{quote|\nThe best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised.\n|source={{harvnb|Galton|1869|p=362}} }}\n\nGalton invented the term ''[[eugenics]]'' in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''. In the book's introduction, he wrote: {{quote|[This book's] intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with \"eugenic\"<sup>1</sup> questions, and to present the results of several of my own separate investigations.<br /><sup>1</sup> This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'', namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalised one than ''viriculture'', which I once ventured to use.|source={{harvnb|Galton|1883|pp=24\u201325}} }}\n\nHe believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged via provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were ''[[dysgenics|dysgenic]]''. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n''[[The Eugenics Review]]'', the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. [[Winston Churchill]] and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n== Model for population stability ==\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Galton, 1890s]]\nGalton's formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton's first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  ''Hereditary Genius'', generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}} This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: \"If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.\"{{sfn|Galton|1914|p=57}}\n\nThis notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1885|title=Opening address as President of the Anthropology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, September 10th, 1885, at Aberdeen|journal=Nature|volume=32|pages=507\u2013510}}</ref> The address was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]],'' and Galton further developed the theory in  \"Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature\" and \"Hereditary Stature.\"{{sfn|Galton|1886|pp=246\u2013263}}{{sfn|Galton|1886b|pp=295\u2013298}} An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in ''Natural Inheritance.'' There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874&ndash;1875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the [[Bean machine|quincunx]] ('bean machine') and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled ''Typical Laws of Heredity'' at the [[Royal Institution]] in London.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}}\n\nIn 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas, and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, \"I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGalton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}} Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.\n\nThe model for population stability resulted in Galton's formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in ''Natural Inheritance,'' states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring's heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring's heritage.{{sfn|Bulmer|1998|pp=579\u2013585}} Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.{{sfn|Gillham|2001b|pp=1383\u20131392}} When [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's]] principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel's principles.{{sfn|Gillham|2013|pp=61\u201375}}\n\n==Empirical test of pangenesis and Lamarckism==\nGalton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called \"[[gemmules]]\" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\" /> He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' where he wrote:\n\n{{quote|\nNow, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.\n|source={{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=502\u2013503}} }}\n\nGalton explicitly rejected the idea of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] ([[Lamarckism]]), and was an early proponent of \"hard heredity\" {{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=105\u2013107}} through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as [[polygenic]] traits). He went on to found the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.\n\nThis approach was later taken up enthusiastically by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Raphael Weldon|W. F. R. Weldon]]; together, they founded the highly influential journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1901.  ([[R. A. Fisher]] would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.{{sfn|Nelson|Pettersson|Carlborg|2013|pp=669\u2013676}}) The statistical techniques that Galton invented (correlation and regression\u2014see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all social sciences.\n\n== Anthropometric Laboratory at the 1884 International Health Exhibition ==\nIn 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to \"show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.\"{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order.\n\nFirst, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nOne excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}} The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.\n\nAlthough the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space, and because of the speed and efficiency with which all the necessary data were gathered. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nGalton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}}\n\nAfter the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write ''Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data''.{{sfn|Gillham|2001c|pp=82-102}} In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when \"the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.\"{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=273-279}}\n\n==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==\n\n===Historiometry===\nThe method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===The lexical hypothesis===\nSir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[lexical hypothesis]].{{sfn|Caprara|Cervone|2000|p=68}} This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].\n\n===The questionnaire===\nGalton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\n===Variance and standard deviation===\nCore to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a [[central tendency]], or mean, and a spread around this central value, or [[variance]]. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the [[standard deviation]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Chad Denby |url=http://www.sciencetimeline.net/1866.htm |title=Science Timeline |publisher=Science Timeline |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nGalton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that \"the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters\",{{sfn|Galton|1907|p=450}} and reported this value (the [[median]], in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported<ref>\"[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]\", ''Nature'', 28 March 1907</ref> the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research{{sfn|Wallis|2014|pp=420-424}} has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in ''Nature'': the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki{{sfn|Surowiecki|2004|p=}} uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.\n\nThe same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.{{sfn|Galton|1906|p=173}}\n\n===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===\n[[File:Quincunx (Galton Box) - Galton 1889 diagram.png|thumb|Galton's 1889 illustration of the quincunx or [[bean machine]].]]\nStudying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a [[pachinko]]-like device also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}\n\n===Bivariate normal distribution===\nHe also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].\n\n===Correlation and regression===\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|Galton's correlation diagram 1886{{sfn|Galton |1886|p= 248|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248-IA3#v=onepage Plate X]}}]]\nIn 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811\u20131863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Bravais|1846|pp=255-332}} After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of [[correlation]] in 1888{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=135-145}}{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=191\u2013196}} and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}} Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Galton\u2013Watson stochastic processes]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=182\u2013184}} This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.\n\nGalton invented the use of the regression line{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit [[histogram]]s and [[Ogive (statistics)|ogives]] to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.\n\n===Regression toward the mean===\nGalton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.\n\nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton{{sfn|Galton|1889|p=}} developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or \"[[bean machine]]\" forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion). Galton then asked the reverse question \"from where did these pellets come?\"\n{{quote|\nThe answer was not \"on average directly above\". Rather it was \"on average, more towards the middle\", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.|\nsource={{harvnb|Stigler|2010|p=477}} }}\n\n===Theories of perception===\nGalton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.\n\n===Differential psychology===\nGalton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction\ntime.{{sfn|Jensen|2002|pp=145-172}} He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.\n\n===Composite photography===\nGalton also devised a technique called \"[[composite portrait]]ure\" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a \"[[natural kind]]\" (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])\u2014such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.\u2014onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or \"composite\", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an \"average\" or \"central type\".{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Galton|1878|pp=132\u2013142}} (See also entry ''Modern physiognomy'' under [[Physiognomy]]).\n\nThis work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar [[Joseph Jacobs]] studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.{{sfn|Novak|2008|p=100}} One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was \"The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs,\" ''Photographic News'', 29, (24 April 1885): 268\u2013269.\n\nGalton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].\n\n==Fingerprints==\nIn a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),{{sfn|Conklin|Gardner|Shortelle|2002|p=}} Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.\n\nThe method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]], who was a friend of Fauld's, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=35}}) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.{{sfn|Innes|2005|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Karl Pearson; Sir Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|Francis Galton (right), aged 87, on the stoep at Fox Holm, Cobham, with the statistician [[Karl Pearson]].]]\nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either \"smothered or superseded\". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,{{sfn|Pearson|1930a|p=413}} and it was published online by University College, London.{{sfn|Galton|Sargent|2001|pp=191-209}}\n\nGalton is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, in the village of [[Claverdon]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref name=\"Challis\" />\n\n==Personal life and character==\nIn January 1853, Galton met [[Louisa Jane Butler]] (1822\u20131897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.{{sfn|Pearson|1914b|p=281}}<ref name=\"auden\" />\n[[File:Louisa Jane Galton00.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Louisa Jane Butler]]\n\nIt has been written of Galton that \"On his own estimation he was a supremely intelligent man.\"{{sfn|Winston|2020}} Later in life, Galton proposed a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience:{{quote|Men who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity.|source={{harvnb|Pearson|1914, 1924, 1930}} }}\n\n==Awards and influence==\nOver the course of his career Galton received many awards, including the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1855 and made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860. His [[autobiography]] also lists:{{sfn|Galton|1909|p=331}}\n\n* Silver Medal, French Geographical Society (1854)\n* Gold Medal of the Royal Society (1886)\n* Officier de l'Instruction Publique, France (1891)\n* D.C.L.

His statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]], first holder of the Galton Chair of Eugenics at [[University College, London]] (now Galton Chair of Genetics), wrote a three-volume biography of Galton, in four parts, after his death.{{sfn|Pearson|1914a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1914b}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930b}}\n\nThe flowering plant genus ''[[Galtonia]]'' was named after Galton.\n\n[[University College London]] has in the twenty-first century been involved in a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics. Galton established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre. \"Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people. The scientists in its thrall claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction, policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away \"undesirables\", including disabled

He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]], and introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|survey]]s for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. He was a pioneer of [[eugenics]], coining the term itself in 1883, and also coined the phrase \"[[nature versus nurture]]\".{{sfn|Galton|1874|pp= 227\u2013236}} His book ''[[Hereditary Genius]]'' (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study [[genius]] and [[greatness]].{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}}\n\nAs an investigator of the human mind, he founded [[psychometrics]] (the science of measuring mental faculties) and [[differential psychology]], as well as the [[lexical hypothesis]] of personality. He devised a method for classifying [[fingerprint]]s that proved useful in [[forensic science]]. He also conducted research on the [[Efficacy of prayer|power of prayer]], concluding it had none due to its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for.{{sfn|Galton|1872|pp=125-135}} His quest for the scientific principles of diverse phenomena extended even to the optimal method for making tea.{{sfn|Galton|1855|p=208}}\n\nAs the initiator of scientific [[meteorology]], he devised the first [[weather map]], proposed a theory of [[anticyclone]]s, and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale.<ref name=\"scienceworld.wolfram.com\" /> He also invented the [[Dog whistle|Galton Whistle]] for testing differential hearing ability.{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}} He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin.{{sfn|Darwin|1887|p=5}}\n\n==Early life==\nGalton was born at \"The Larches\", a large house in the [[Sparkbrook]] area of [[Birmingham]], England, built on the site of \"Fair Hill\", the former home of [[Joseph Priestley]], which the [[botanist]] [[William Withering]] had renamed. He was [[Charles Darwin]]'s half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent [[Erasmus Darwin]]. His father was [[Samuel Tertius Galton]], son of [[Samuel \"John\" Galton]]. The Galtons were [[Quaker]] gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science.\n\nHe was cousin of [[Douglas Strutt Galton]] and half-cousin of [[Charles Darwin]]. Both families had Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham, which included [[Matthew Boulton|Boulton]], [[James Watt|Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]], [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]. Both families were known for their literary talent. Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse. Galton's aunt [[Mary Anne Galton]] wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her autobiography detailed the environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.\n\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton by Octavius Oakley.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Galton by [[Octavius Oakley]], 1840]]\n\nGalton was a [[child prodigy]]&nbsp;\u2013 he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]] and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including [[Shakespeare]] for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}} Galton attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], but chafed at the narrow classical curriculum and left at 16.{{sfn|Cowan|2005}} His parents pressed him to enter the medical profession, and he studied for two years at [[Birmingham General Hospital]] and [[King's College London]] [[Medical School]]. He followed this up with mathematical studies at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge]], from 1840 to early 1844.<ref name=\"ACAD\" />\n\nAccording to the records of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]], it was in February 1844 that Galton became a [[freemason]] at the ''Scientific'' lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A note in the record states: \"Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845\".<ref name=\"Freemasonry\" /> One of Galton's masonic certificates from ''Scientific'' lodge can be found among his papers at [[University College, London]].<ref name=\"MerringtonGolden1976\" />\n\nA [[nervous breakdown]] prevented Galton's intent to try for honours. He elected instead to take a \"poll\" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=5}} (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He briefly resumed his medical studies but the death of his father in 1844 left him emotionally destitute, though financially independent,{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention.\n\nIn his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a notable solo trip through Eastern Europe to [[Constantinople]], before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846, he went to [[Egypt]] and travelled up the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in the [[Sudan]], and from there to [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]] and down the [[Jordan]].\n\nIn 1850 he joined the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult [[exploration|expedition]] into then little-known [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]). He wrote a book on his experience, \"Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa\".{{sfn|Galton|1853}} He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=16}} This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling ''The Art of Travel'', a handbook of practical advice for the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print.\n\n==Middle years==\n[[File:Francis_Galton_1850s.jpg|thumb|Galton in the 1850s]]\nGalton was a [[polymath]] who made important contributions in many fields of science, including [[meteorology]] (the [[anti-cyclone]] and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), [[psychology]] ([[synaesthesia]]), [[biology]] (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and [[criminology]] (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his [[penchant]] for counting and measuring. Galton prepared the first [[weather map]] published in ''[[The Times]]'' (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.<ref name=\"meteor\" />\n\nHe became very active in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=29}} He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council.\n\n[[James McKeen Cattell]], a student of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\nIn 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.{{sfn|Hergenhahn|Henley|2013|p=288}}\n\nIn 1873, Galton wrote a controversial letter to ''[[The Times]]'' titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.<ref name=\"TheTimes1873\" />\n\n==Heredity and eugenics==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}<!--first 4 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|Galton in his later years]]\nThe publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life.{{sfn|Forrest|1974|page=84}} He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on \"Variation under Domestication\", concerning [[animal breeding]].\n\nGalton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In doing so, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.\n\nGalton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was [[hereditary]], and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of [[historiometry]]. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869.{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=}} Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the [[inheritance of intelligence|inheritance of abilities]].\n\nGalton recognised the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper ''The history of twins'' in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of [[behaviour genetics]], which relies heavily on [[twin studies]]. He concluded that the evidence favoured nature rather than nurture. He also proposed [[adoption study|adoption studies]], including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment.\n\nGalton recognised that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilisation's citizens, and their [[reproductive success]]. In ''Hereditary Genius'', he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:\n\n{{quote|\nThe best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honour as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalised.\n|source={{harvnb|Galton|1869|p=362}} }}\n\nGalton invented the term ''[[eugenics]]'' in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]''. In the book's introduction, he wrote: {{quote|[This book's] intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with \"eugenic\"<sup>1</sup> questions, and to present the results of several of my own separate investigations.<br /><sup>1</sup> This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'', namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalised one than ''viriculture'', which I once ventured to use.|source={{harvnb|Galton|1883|pp=24\u201325}} }}\n\nHe believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged via provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were ''[[dysgenics|dysgenic]]''. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n''[[The Eugenics Review]]'', the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. [[Winston Churchill]] and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}}\n\n== Model for population stability ==\n[[File:Sir Francis Galton, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Galton, 1890s]]\nGalton's formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton's first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  ''Hereditary Genius'', generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}} This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: \"If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.\"{{sfn|Galton|1914|p=57}}\n\nThis notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|year=1885|title=Opening address as President of the Anthropology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, September 10th, 1885, at Aberdeen|journal=Nature|volume=32|pages=507\u2013510}}</ref> The address was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]],'' and Galton further developed the theory in  \"Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature\" and \"Hereditary Stature.\"{{sfn|Galton|1886|pp=246\u2013263}}{{sfn|Galton|1886b|pp=295\u2013298}} An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in ''Natural Inheritance.'' There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874&ndash;1875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}}\n\nGalton's development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the [[Bean machine|quincunx]] ('bean machine') and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled ''Typical Laws of Heredity'' at the [[Royal Institution]] in London.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} In this lecture, he posed that there must a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.{{sfn|Stigler|2010|pp=469\u2013482}}\n\nIn 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas, and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.{{sfn|Galton|1877|pp=492\u2013495, 512\u2013514, 532\u2013533}} He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, \"I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGalton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.{{sfn|Stigler|1986|pp=265\u2013299}} Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.\n\nThe model for population stability resulted in Galton's formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in ''Natural Inheritance,'' states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring's heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring's heritage.{{sfn|Bulmer|1998|pp=579\u2013585}} Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.{{sfn|Gillham|2001b|pp=1383\u20131392}} When [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's]] principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel's principles.{{sfn|Gillham|2013|pp=61\u201375}}\n\n==Empirical test of pangenesis and Lamarckism==\nGalton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothesis of [[pangenesis]]. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called \"[[gemmules]]\" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\" /> He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' where he wrote:\n\n{{quote|\nNow, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.\n|source={{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=502\u2013503}} }}\n\nGalton explicitly rejected the idea of the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] ([[Lamarckism]]), and was an early proponent of \"hard heredity\" {{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=105\u2013107}} through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now known as [[polygenic]] traits). He went on to found the [[Biostatistics|biometric]] approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity.\n\nThis approach was later taken up enthusiastically by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Raphael Weldon|W. F. R. Weldon]]; together, they founded the highly influential journal ''[[Biometrika]]'' in 1901.  ([[R. A. Fisher]] would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.{{sfn|Nelson|Pettersson|Carlborg|2013|pp=669\u2013676}}) The statistical techniques that Galton invented (correlation and regression\u2014see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all the social sciences.\n\n== Anthropometric Laboratory at the 1884 International Health Exhibition ==\nIn 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to \"show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.\"{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order.\n\nFirst, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nOne excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}} The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.\n\nAlthough the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space, and because of the speed and efficiency with which all the necessary data were gathered. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}}\n\nGalton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.{{sfn|Galton|1885|pp=205-221}} The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.{{sfn|Galton|1884|p=}}\n\nAfter the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write ''Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data''.{{sfn|Gillham|2001c|pp=82-102}} In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when \"the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.\"{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=273-279}}\n\n==Innovations in statistics and psychological theory==\n\n===Historiometry===\nThe method used in ''Hereditary Genius'' has been described as the first example of [[historiometry]]. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]]. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as [[birth order]] and the occupation and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, ''English men of science: their nature and nurture'', in 1874. In the end, it promoted the [[nature versus nurture]] question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===The lexical hypothesis===\nSir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the [[lexical hypothesis]].{{sfn|Caprara|Cervone|2000|p=68}} This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human [[personality traits]].\n\n===The questionnaire===\nGalton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as [[visual memory|mental imagery]]. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the [[questionnaire]]. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\n===Variance and standard deviation===\nCore to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a [[central tendency]], or mean, and a spread around this central value, or [[variance]]. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the [[standard deviation]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Chad Denby |url=http://www.sciencetimeline.net/1866.htm |title=Science Timeline |publisher=Science Timeline |accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nGalton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that \"the middlemost estimate expresses the ''vox populi'', every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters\",{{sfn|Galton|1907|p=450}} and reported this value (the [[median]], in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported<ref>\"[http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/essays/pages/galton-1907-ballot-box_1.htm The Ballot Box]\", ''Nature'', 28 March 1907</ref> the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research{{sfn|Wallis|2014|pp=420-424}} has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in ''Nature'': the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki{{sfn|Surowiecki|2004|p=}} uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.\n\nThe same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.{{sfn|Galton|1906|p=173}}\n\n===Experimental derivation of the normal distribution===\n[[File:Quincunx (Galton Box) - Galton 1889 diagram.png|thumb|Galton's 1889 illustration of the quincunx or [[bean machine]].]]\nStudying variation, Galton invented the quincunx, a [[pachinko]]-like device also known as the [[bean machine]], as a tool for demonstrating the [[law of error]] and the [[normal distribution]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=4}}\n\n===Bivariate normal distribution===\nHe also discovered the properties of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] and its relationship to [[regression analysis]].\n\n===Correlation and regression===\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|Galton's correlation diagram 1886{{sfn|Galton |1886|p= 248|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248-IA3#v=onepage Plate X]}}]]\nIn 1846, the French physicist [[Auguste Bravais]] (1811\u20131863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Bravais|1846|pp=255-332}} After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of [[correlation]] in 1888{{sfn|Galton|1888|pp=135-145}}{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=191\u2013196}} and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}} Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Galton\u2013Watson stochastic processes]].{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|pp=182\u2013184}} This is now a core of modern statistics and regression.\n\nGalton invented the use of the regression line{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=184}} and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.{{sfn|Clauser|2007|pp=440-444}}\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of [[normal distribution|normal theory]] to fit [[histogram]]s and [[Ogive (statistics)|ogives]] to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance [[big data|large samples]] of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean.\n\n===Regression toward the mean===\nGalton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of [[regression toward the mean]], which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas.\n\nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of [[simple linear regression]] of data points. Galton{{sfn|Galton|1889|p=}} developed the following model: pellets fall through a ''[[quincunx]]'' or \"[[bean machine]]\" forming a normal distribution centered directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion). Galton then asked the reverse question \"from where did these pellets come?\"\n{{quote|\nThe answer was not \"on average directly above\". Rather it was \"on average, more towards the middle\", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.|\nsource={{harvnb|Stigler|2010|p=477}} }}\n\n===Theories of perception===\nGalton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.{{sfn|Gillham|2001a|p=}} It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety.\n\n===Differential psychology===\nGalton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of [[differential psychology]] and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction\ntime.{{sfn|Jensen|2002|pp=145-172}} He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others.\n\n===Composite photography===\nGalton also devised a technique called \"[[composite portrait]]ure\" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see [[averageness]]). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the [[attractiveness]] of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including [[Sigmund Freud]] in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an [[Ideal type]] or a [[concept]] of a \"[[natural kind]]\" (see [[Eleanor Rosch]])\u2014such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.\u2014onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or \"composite\", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an \"average\" or \"central type\".{{sfn|Galton|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Galton|1878|pp=132\u2013142}} (See also entry ''Modern physiognomy'' under [[Physiognomy]]).\n\nThis work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar [[Joseph Jacobs]] studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.{{sfn|Novak|2008|p=100}} One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was \"The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs,\" ''Photographic News'', 29, (24 April 1885): 268\u2013269.\n\nGalton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers [[Lewis Hine]] and [[John L. Lovell]] and [[Arthur Batut]].\n\n==Fingerprints==\nIn a [[Royal Institution]] paper in 1888 and three books (''[[Finger Prints (book)|Finger Prints]]'', 1892; ''Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints'', 1893; and ''Fingerprint Directories'', 1895),{{sfn|Conklin|Gardner|Shortelle|2002|p=}} Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same [[fingerprint]] and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day.\n\nThe method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir [[William James Herschel]] in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr [[Henry Faulds]] in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]], who was a friend of Fauld's, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts{{sfn|Bulmer|2003|p=35}}) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Galton pointed out that there were specific types of fingerprint patterns. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.{{sfn|Innes|2005|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Final years==\n[[File:Karl Pearson; Sir Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|Francis Galton (right), aged 87, on the stoep at Fox Holm, Cobham, with the statistician [[Karl Pearson]].]]\nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled ''Kantsaywhere'' from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed [[Fitness (biology)|fitter]] and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either \"smothered or superseded\". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,{{sfn|Pearson|1930a|p=413}} and it was published online by University College, London.{{sfn|Galton|Sargent|2001|pp=191-209}}\n\nGalton is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, in the village of [[Claverdon]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref name=\"Challis\" />\n\n==Personal life and character==\nIn January 1853, Galton met [[Louisa Jane Butler]] (1822\u20131897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.{{sfn|Pearson|1914b|p=281}}<ref name=\"auden\" />\n[[File:Louisa Jane Galton00.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Louisa Jane Butler]]\n\nIt has been written of Galton that \"On his own estimation he was a supremely intelligent man.\"{{sfn|Winston|2020}} Later in life, Galton proposed a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience:{{quote|Men who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity.|source={{harvnb|Pearson|1914, 1924, 1930}} }}\n\n==Awards and influence==\nOver the course of his career Galton received many awards, including the [[Copley Medal]] of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in 1855 and made a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1860. His [[autobiography]] also lists:{{sfn|Galton|1909|p=331}}\n\n* Silver Medal, French Geographical Society (1854)\n* Gold Medal of the Royal Society (1886)\n* Officier de l'Instruction Publique, France (1891)\n* D.C.L.

Fellow Trinity College, Cambridge (1902)\n* Darwin Medal, Royal Society (1902)\n* [[Linnean Society of London]]'s [[Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal]] (1908)\n\nGalton was knighted in 1909. His statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]], first holder of the Galton Chair of Eugenics at [[University College, London]] (now Galton Chair of Genetics), wrote a three-volume biography of Galton, in four parts, after his death.{{sfn|Pearson|1914a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1914b}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930a}}{{sfn|Pearson|1930b}}\n\nThe flowering plant genus ''[[Galtonia]]'' was named after Galton.\n\n[[University College London]] has in the twenty-first century been involved in a historical inquiry into its role as the institutional birthplace of eugenics. Galton established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre. \"Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people. The scientists in its thrall claimed this could be achieved by controlling reproduction, policing borders to prevent certain types of immigrants, and locking away \"undesirables\", including disabled people.\"{{sfn|Saini|2019}}\n\n==Published works==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Galton |first=Francis |title=The art of travel, or, Shifts and contrivances available in wild

{"title_page": "Soulbury Commission", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Ceylonese colonial constitutional reform}}{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Soulbury]] Commission ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0ddd\u0dbd\u0dca\u0db6\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0db7\u0dcf\u0dc0 ''Solbari Komishan Sabhawa''), announced in 1944 was, like its predecessor, the [[Donoughmore Commission]], a prime instrument of constitutional reform in [[British Ceylon]]. The immediate basis for the appointment of a commission for constitutional reforms was the 1944 draft constitution  of the Board of Ministers, headed by [[D.S. Senanayake]]. This commission ushered in [[Dominion]] status and Independence to Sri Lanka in 1948. Its constitutional recommendations were largely those of the 1944 Board of Ministers' draft, a document reflecting the influence of Senanayake and his main advisor, Sir [[Ivor Jennings]].<ref name=\"kms\">Prof. K. M. de Silva, History of Sri Lanka, Penguin 1995</ref>\n\n==Background to the appointment of the commission==\nThe struggle for Independence in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] had been fought on \"constitutionalist\" lines rather than on the strongly confrontational approach that had developed in British India. Only the Marxists, a tiny minority, had attempted to create confrontational conditions which they believed to be a harbinger of the impending [[proletarian revolution]] against Imperialism. D. S. Senanayake was the leader of the \"constitutionalist\" wing of the Sri Lankan independence movement. He began to develop a \"Ceylonese\" vision for Sri Lanka, i.e., co-operation of all the ethnic and religious groups. To this end he masterminded the appointment of [[Arunachalam Mahadeva]], a respected Tamil politician as the minister of Home affaires(,<ref name=\"kms\" /> p560). Senanayake began to formulate a draft constitution following the conditions laid down by the Colonial Secretary of State in 1943. There were three aspects to the effort. The first was the abandonment of the [[Donoughmore Constitution]] and the formulation of a [[Westminster Model]]. The second was that the Governor's reserve powers and other controls of the Imperial government would be abandoned and there would be full responsibility in internal civil matters. However, the crown's reserve powers would be retained especially in regard to limitations set upon the [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] legislature regarding religious and ethnic minorities. The Crown would also retain defence and external affairs. The third was the ratification of the new constitution by a 3/4 majority in the State Council of Ceylon.\n\n==The Draft Constitution of the Board of Ministers==\nSenanayake and his advisors worked with remarkable speed by 1944, and a draft was made ready for submission to [[Whitehall]]. Many groups who opposed the move towards independence, notably British business groups, certain church dignitaries criticized the rapid moves in what they termed \"lack of consultation\". The 1943 Colonial Secretary's discussions envisaged that the draft constitution would be examined by a \"suitable commission or conference\", after the victory over the Axis powers. However, Senanayake pressed for an immediate consideration of their proposals. There was great reluctance and no sense of urgency on the part of the Colonial office. However, Senanayake, [[Oliver Goonetilleke]] and others had developed impressive contacts with Lord [[Mountbatten]] who, as Supreme Allied Commander of South-East Asia had worked from [[Colombo]]. A telegram from Lord Mountbatten <ref>Mountbatten's Telegram No: SAC 2626, 22 May 1944, marked \"Top Secret\" to the war cabinet.</ref> is believed have been crucial in over-riding the foot-dragging of the Colonial office and conceding to Senanayake's demands. The appointment of a commission was made on July 5, 1944.\n\n==Reaction to the Commission==\nAlthough the appointment of a commission without waiting for the end of the War was a great concession, the announcement of the Commission headed by [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Lord Soulbury]] was greeted with dismay by Senanayake and others. Their disappointment was due to the widening of the scope of the commission beyond what was set out by the Colonial Secretary in 1943, to also consult with \"various interests, including the minority communities concerned with the subject of constitutional reforms in Ceylon\". Senanayake was a man who preferred behind-the-curtain negotiations instead of confrontational public hearings. He felt that such consultations would simply become very divisive. In fact, the politics of the 1930s had become very communal or racist, with the first Sinhala-Tamil riot occurring in 1939, after an inflammatory speech by [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], a leading Tamil politician.<ref name=\"jane\">Dr. Jane. Russell, Communal Politics under the Donoughmore Constitution, 1931-1947, Tissara Publishers, Colombo 1982</ref> Senanayake and the Board of Ministers resorted to an official boycott of the commission as an expression of their disapproval of the widening of the scope of the commission. However, this merely meant that they did not appear before the commission in public or \"official\" sittings. Senanayake and his associates held private meetings where the commissioners were the guests of honour. In fact, [[Oliver Goonetilleke]] became an \"unofficial secretary\" to the commission and significantly influenced it. This enabled Senanayake and his advisors to present their views without getting into confrontational politics with the [[Tamil Congress]], led by G. G. Ponnambalam who was allowed to dominate many of the official hearings.\n\n===G. G. Ponnambalam's submissions===\nTamil politics during the time of the Donoughmore Commission was dominated by [[casteism]], with [[P. Ramanathan]] as its chief exponent. Tamils, only about 15% {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of the population, had a strong, dominant position in the early legislatures of the country. The introduction of [[Universal Franchise]] in 1931 completely changed the character of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] politics, where Tamil politicians found it very difficult to accept that they would become a minority. The eminent [[Peradeniya]] historian, Prof. K. M.de Silva attributes this to the collapse of the [[Ceylon National Congress]]. According to Dr. Jane Russell, Tamils also found it very irksome that the Sinhalese possessed a written history known as the [[Mahavamsa]] extending back to some 25 centuries {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, whereas the Tamils were seen as later migrants or invading settlers. This, as well as other factors led to a development of Tamil nationalism and communal feeling, displacing casteism to a secondary place in the nation's politics. Communal politics, which involved attacks on the [[Mahavamsa]], suspicious examination of appointments to public office, opening of colonisation schemes etc., for communal bias became common place. G. G. Ponnambalam wrested control of Tamil politics from the Arunachalam-family  elitist Colombo Tamil group and followed a stridently communal political program. This was matched by similar nationalist politics, led by [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]], the Sinhalese counterpart of Ponnambalam.\n\n====Balance representation scheme====\nThe Tamil Congress, led by Ponnambalam, had evolved the policy of 50-50, i.e., allocation of an equal number of seats in the legislature to the Tamils and the Sinhalese, over-riding the natural Universal Franchise representation where the 15% Tamils, 75% Sinhalese {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, would lead to only about 15 seats in a chamber with 100 representatives,(<ref name=\"jane\" /> p308). Ponnambalam, an English-educated Catholic lawyer who was elitist and abrasive by temperament justified this by pointing out that there were roughly equal numbers of English educated (i.e., upper caste) Sinhalese and Tamils, and that this would also guarantee a place of political parity for the Tamils.  Thus Ponnambalam proposed that the legislature should be: \"based on the balanced scheme of representation that would avoid the danger of concentration of power in one community, but would ensure its equitable distribution among all communities and the people as a whole\"(,<ref name=\"soulbury\">Soulbury Report, London, 1945</ref> p.&nbsp;92). Ponnambalam also proposed further constitutional mechanisms to \"safeguard minority rights\".\n\nPonnambalam's very artificial and unusual schemes for securing the continued parity of status of Tamils, completely contrary to the \"one man-one vote\" concept thoroughly accepted in European liberalism, met with severe disapprobation by the commissioners. They stated that \"any attempt by artificial means to convert a majority into a minority is not only inequitable, but doomed to failure\".<ref name=\"soulbury\" /> Ponnambalam's proposals were considered to be a means of conferring a minority supremacy amounting to virtual majority rule, and \"denial of the democratic principle\"(<ref name=\"jane\" />  p.&nbsp;311). The ''Hindu organ'', an influential newspaper of the time, condemned it as something that \"can only be maintained against the united opposition of the Sinhalese by British bayonets\".\n\n====Claims of Discrimination====\nThe submissions in front of the Soulbury commission also included specific grievances of the Ceylon Tamils regarding claimed unfair discrimination against their community. These included claims of discrimination in appointments to the Public Service,  claims of settlement policies in newly opened colonisation schemes which favour the Sinhalese, the Buddhist Temporalities act of 1931, the [[Anuradhapura]] Preservation Ordinance of 1931, the question of ports in the Northern peninsula, a claimed discriminatory bias in education, medical services etc., favouring the Sinhalese.\n\nHowever, the commission concluded that \"the evidence submitted to us provides no substantial indication of a general policy on the part of the Government of Ceylon of discrimination against minority communities\".\n\nThe extensive and lengthy orations of Ponnambalam were rewarded by the commissioners by introducing a provision for multi-member constituencies in suitable areas, allowing for greater representation for ethnic minorities like Tamils, Muslims and other groups. The commissioners also recommended inclusion of provisions relating to communal discrimination. The first was that \"the Parliament of Ceylon shall not make any law rendering persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities are not made liable,&nbsp;...\". Another provision was that any bill which evoked \"serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, in the opinion of the Governor-General is likely to involve oppression or serious injustice to any community must be reserved by the Governor-General\"(<ref name=\"soulbury\" /> p.&nbsp;101).\n\n===Kandyan Proposals===\nThe low-country Sinhalese and the Kandyans had largely co-operated in their politics during the 1930s. [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|Bandaranaike]]'s marriage to the Ratwatte family, influential in Kandyan circles, had also helped to bridge the gap between the two groups. However, the presence of a commission gave the Kandyan groups a chance to claim some powers for themselves, just as the Tamil Congress was largely arguing to secure Tamil interests.  The Kandyans proposed a Federal scheme where the Up-country region, the Low-country, and the North would be three federal states. Their suggestions were rejected by the commissioners who found no merit in the federal proposals.\n\n==Acceptance of the Soulbury Constitution==\nThe British historian Jane Russell argues that the official boycott of the Soulbury Commission by the Board of Ministers led by Senanayake was a \"statesman-like action, if not a diplomatic coup. The fact that the more&nbsp;... communal-minded (politicians) held aloof&nbsp;... , enabled the minorities to have the floor unchallenged. This manoeuvre avoided a repetition of the situation&nbsp;... of the Donoughmore Commission where there had been a spiraling of communal demands as accusations and denunciations (which) provoked counter-accusations,&nbsp;... until communal tension reached&nbsp;... in outbreaks of violence. (sic) It enabled G. G. Ponnambalam to strut about the political arena for a few months unimpeded\", while the Board of Ministers maintained a quiet dignity while doing behind-the-curtain politics. Thus the visit of the Soulbury Commission and the final Soulbury Report did much to reconcile the minority communities with the Sinhalese leadership under D. S. Senanayake. The voting in the third reading (in March) of the \"Free Lanka\" bill of January 1945, was supported by all the Muslim members, and by T. G. Rajakulendran, S. P. Vytilingam,  and V. Nalliah. Some of the other minority members who did not want to openly support the bill took care to be absent or abstain. Finally, the debate and the vote of acceptance on the eighth and ninth of September 1945 was the most significant indication of general reconciliation among the ethnic and regional groups. Far exceeding the 3/4 majority required by the Soulbury Commission, Senanayake had 51 votes in favour and only three votes against the adoption of the constitution. The vote was \"in many ways a vote of confidence by all communities in&nbsp;... Senanayake\", and the minorities were as anxious as the majority for self-government(<ref name=\"jane\" /> p 317, also,<ref>Ivor Jennings, The Constitution of Ceylon, Oxford University Press, 1949</ref> p.&nbsp;6).\n\nSenanayake's speech in proposing the motion of acceptance made reference to the minorities and said \"throughout this period the Ministers had in view one objective only, the attainment of maximum freedom. Accusations of Sinhalese domination have been bandied about. We can afford to ignore them for it must be plain to every one that what we sought was not Sinhalese domination, but Ceylonese domination. We devised a scheme that gave heavy weight to the minorities; we deliberately protected them against discriminatory legislation. We vested important powers in the Governor-General&nbsp;... We decided upon an Independent Public Service Commission so as to give assurance that there should be no communalism in the Public Srvice.(sic) I do not normally speak as a Sinhalese, and I do not think that the Leader of this Council ought to think of himself as a Sinhalese representative, but for once I should like to speak as a Sinhalese and assert with all the force at my command that the interests of one community are the interests of all. We are one of another, what ever race or creed.\"<ref>Hansard, State Council of Ceylon 1945</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended, D. S. Senanayake was ready, on a mission to Whitehall to push for full dominion status instead of the status discussed in the 1943 Colonial secretary's report. During August\u2013September 1945 Senanayake argued that the limits on Ceylon's external sovereignty (defence and external affairs), adhered to by the Soulbury report were unworkable and unnecessary. Senanayake suggested the confirmation of Dominion status by an Order in Council, and delivered a draft to G. H. Hall, the new Secretary to the Colonies. While the new labour government was prepared to accept the Soulbury report, it was firmly opposed to granting Dominion Status. The British were willing to consider Dominion status six years after the Soulbury constitution, say in 1953-54, although this was not revealed to the Ceylonese politicians. In 1947, with the general election to the new parliament scheduled for August\u2013September 1947, Senanayake once again pressed Whitehall for a more precise date for Dominion Status. Arthur Creeh-Jones, successor to Hall in the Colonial office was much more receptive to Senanayake's request. Independence for India was announced by the Labour cabinet on 20 February 1947. Oliver Goonatilleke, who was handling the negotiations in Whitehall on behalf of Senanayake, argued that the immediate granting of Dominion Status was urgently necessary since the moderates were under increasing pressure from left-wing and nationalist extremist groups. The British government made the official announcement on 18 June 1947 that the Island would receive \"fully responsible status within the British Commonwealth of Nations\".\n\nG. G. Ponnambalam had in the 1930s begun to declare that he is a \"proud Dravidian\"<ref>Hansard 1935</ref> and had rejected the \"Ceylonese Concept\" of Senanayake and others at the time. At the end of the Soulbury submissions, he decided to moderate his politics, and publicly advocated \"responsive cooperation\" with the Sinhalese leaders. He joined the cabinet of D. S. Senanayake who became the first prime minister of independent Ceylon in 1948. [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]], the Sinhalese Nationalist counterpart of Ponnambalam had also joined the cabinet, leaving the opposition to the Marxists and small nationalist groups.\n\n==The aftermath==\nAn important piece of legislation, enacted in 1948, and modified in 1949, was the Indian Citizenship act, which limited citizenship to [[Hill-country Tamils|Indian workers]] who had at least 10 years of residence in the country <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sandaruwan.tripod.com/mythology.htm|title=S. M. Bandara, Details of the citizenship act.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010531123753/http://sandaruwan.tripod.com/mythology.htm|archivedate=2001-05-31}}</ref> This was similar to the requirement which was then current in most European countries. Although Senanayake had consistently supported their citizenship under less strict conditions as early as 1923, and as late as 1941 in the Indo-Ceylon talks,<ref>See Senator Natesan's speech, Hansard 1948</ref> this change of attitude was a reaction to the increasing agitation of the Marxist trade-unionists whose power was misjudged by the colonial administration as well as most politicians of that era. Thus Senanayake was supported by many Tamil leaders including Ponnambalam, and constitutionalists like Dr. Ivor Jennings, in regard to the Indian citizenship act. The Soulbury commission had also recommended a \"status quo\" with regard to Indian workers. However, this was criticized by Senator Natesan, S. J. V. Chelvanayagam and followers who represented the emerging Tamil-nationalist fringe.\n\nAlthough Ponnambalam moderated his politics and moved to the center, there was thus no shortage of ultra-nationalists or militant groups who attacked Senanayake's synthesis of all moderate groups within his United National Party of Ceylon. Because the \"constitutionalist\" approach of Senanayake and others led to independence without the fire and violence of the Indian program, many contended that the \"independence\" was illusory. Fears were expressed, mainly by the Marxists, of secret clauses and a hidden treaty. Events were to prove that these claims were false(,<ref name=\"kms\" /> p.&nbsp;569).\n\nAn ultra-nationalist Tamil movement which had previously grouped as the league of Tamil Federations denounced Ponnambalam and other Tamils as \"traitors\" and formed the [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Federal Party]]. This party would present a deeply separatist agenda in its Tamil-language publications {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, but presented a more moderate picture in its English language presentations, where it was known as the Federal Party. The Federal party and the Marxist parties began to attack the Senanayake government, but at that time their support in the country was minimal. The greatest threat to Senanayake's policies came when Bandaranaike left the Senanayake cabinet and formed the Sinhala nationalist [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (Sri Lanka Nidahas Pakshaya)(SLFP).  Senanayake died in a horse riding accident in 1952, and after that the  low-key, behind-the-curtain approach of Senanayake was displaced by direct communal agitation for lingusitic and other demands of the two communities, led by the SLFP and the Federal Party. The \"satyagraha\" sit-ins of the Federal Party developed into violent confrontations which, over time lead to the emergence of the Tamil United Liberation Front [[TULF]] which in 1976 declared, in the city of Vaddukkoddei , a policy of a separate state for the Tamils. This was an idea which had been part of the thinking of the Federal Party since its inception, although it did not come to the fore-front till 1976.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Politics of Sri Lanka navbox}}\n{{Legislatures of modern Sri Lanka}}\n{{British Ceylon period topics}}\n\n[[Category:Constitutions of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:British Ceylon period]]\n[[Category:Sri Lankan commissions and inquiries]]\n[[Category:Origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War]]\n[[Category:1940s in Ceylon]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Ceylonese colonial constitutional reform}}{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Soulbury]] Commission ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0ddd\u0dbd\u0dca\u0db6\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0ddc\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dc2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0db7\u0dcf\u0dc0 ''Solbari Komishan Sabhawa''), announced in 1944 was, like its predecessor, the [[Donoughmore Commission]], a prime instrument of constitutional reform in [[British Ceylon]]. The immediate basis for the appointment of a commission for constitutional reforms was the 1944 draft constitution  of the Board of Ministers, headed by [[D.S. Senanayake]]. This commission ushered in [[Dominion]] status and Independence to Sri Lanka in 1948. Its constitutional recommendations were largely those of the 1944 Board of Ministers' draft, a document reflecting the influence of Senanayake and his main advisor, Sir [[Ivor Jennings]]<ref name=\"kms\">Prof. K. M. de Silva, History of Sri Lanka, Penguin 1995</ref>.\n\n==Background to the appointment of the commission==\nThe struggle for Independence in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] had been fought on \"constitutionalist\" lines rather than on the strongly confrontational approach that had developed in British India. Only the Marxists, a tiny minority, had attempted to create confrontational conditions which they believed to be a harbinger of the impending [[proletarian revolution]] against Imperialism. D. S. Senanayake was the leader of the \"constitutionalist\" wing of the Sri Lankan independence movement. He began to develop a \"Ceylonese\" vision for Sri Lanka, i.e., co-operation of all the ethnic and religious groups. To this end he masterminded the appointment of [[Arunachalam Mahadeva]], a respected Tamil politician as the minister of Home affaires(,<ref name=\"kms\" /> p560). Senanayake began to formulate a draft constitution following the conditions laid down by the Colonial Secretary of State in 1943. There were three aspects to the effort. The first was the abandonment of the [[Donoughmore Constitution]] and the formulation of a [[Westminster Model]]. The second was that the Governor's reserve powers and other controls of the Imperial government would be abandoned and there would be full responsibility in internal civil matters. However, the crown's reserve powers would be retained especially in regard to limitations set upon the [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] legislature regarding religious and ethnic minorities. The Crown would also retain defence and external affairs. The third was the ratification of the new constitution by a 3/4 majority in the State Council of Ceylon.\n\n==The Draft Constitution of the Board of Ministers==\nSenanayake and his advisors worked with remarkable speed by 1944, and a draft was made ready for submission to [[Whitehall]]. Many groups who opposed the move towards independence, notably British business groups, certain church dignitaries criticized the rapid moves in what they termed \"lack of consultation\". The 1943 Colonial Secretary's discussions envisaged that the draft constitution would be examined by a \"suitable commission or conference\", after the victory over the Axis powers. However, Senanayake pressed for an immediate consideration of their proposals. There was great reluctance and no sense of urgency on the part of the Colonial office. However, Senanayake, [[Oliver Goonetilleke]] and others had developed impressive contacts with Lord [[Mountbatten]] who, as Supreme Allied Commander of South-East Asia had worked from [[Colombo]]. A telegram from Lord Mountbatten <ref>Mountbatten's Telegram No: SAC 2626, 22 May 1944, marked \"Top Secret\" to the war cabinet.</ref> is believed have been crucial in over-riding the foot-dragging of the Colonial office and conceding to Senanayake's demands. The appointment of a commission was made on July 5, 1944.\n\n==Reaction to the Commission==\nAlthough the appointment of a commission without waiting for the end of the War was a great concession, the announcement of the Commission headed by [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Lord Soulbury]] was greeted with dismay by Senanayake and others. Their disappointment was due to the widening of the scope of the commission beyond what was set out by the Colonial Secretary in 1943, to also consult with \"various interests, including the minority communities concerned with the subject of constitutional reforms in Ceylon\". Senanayake was a man who preferred behind-the-curtain negotiations instead of confrontational public hearings. He felt that such consultations would simply become very divisive. In fact, the politics of the 1930s had become very communal or racist, with the first Sinhala-Tamil riot occurring in 1939, after an inflammatory speech by [[G. G. Ponnambalam]], a leading Tamil politician.<ref name=\"jane\">Dr. Jane. Russell, Communal Politics under the Donoughmore Constitution, 1931-1947, Tissara Publishers, Colombo 1982</ref> Senanayake and the Board of Ministers resorted to an official boycott of the commission as an expression of their disapproval of the widening of the scope of the commission. However, this merely meant that they did not appear before the commission in public or \"official\" sittings. Senanayake and his associates held private meetings where the commissioners were the guests of honour. In fact, [[Oliver Goonetilleke]] became an \"unofficial secretary\" to the commission and significantly influenced it. This enabled Senanayake and his advisors to present their views without getting into confrontational politics with the [[Tamil Congress]], led by G. G. Ponnambalam who was allowed to dominate many of the official hearings.\n\n===G. G. Ponnambalam's submissions===\nTamil politics during the time of the Donoughmore Commission was dominated by [[casteism]], with [[P. Ramanathan]] as its chief exponent. Tamils, only about 15% {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of the population, had a strong, dominant position in the early legislatures of the country. The introduction of [[Universal Franchise]] in 1931 completely changed the character of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]] politics, where Tamil politicians found it very difficult to accept that they would become a minority. The eminent [[Peradeniya]] historian, Prof. K. M.de Silva attributes this to the collapse of the [[Ceylon National Congress]]. According to Dr. Jane Russell, Tamils also found it very irksome that the Sinhalese possessed a written history known as the [[Mahavamsa]] extending back to some 25 centuries {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, whereas the Tamils were seen as later migrants or invading settlers. This, as well as other factors led to a development of Tamil nationalism and communal feeling, displacing casteism to a secondary place in the nation's politics. Communal politics, which involved attacks on the [[Mahavamsa]], suspicious examination of appointments to public office, opening of colonisation schemes etc., for communal bias became common place. G. G. Ponnambalam wrested control of Tamil politics from the Arunachalam-family  elitist Colombo Tamil group and followed a stridently communal political program. This was matched by similar nationalist politics, led by [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]], the Sinhalese counterpart of Ponnambalam.\n\n====Balance representation scheme====\nThe Tamil Congress, led by Ponnambalam, had evolved the policy of 50-50, i.e., allocation of an equal number of seats in the legislature to the Tamils and the Sinhalese, over-riding the natural Universal Franchise representation where the 15% Tamils, 75% Sinhalese {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, would lead to only about 15 seats in a chamber with 100 representatives,(<ref name=\"jane\" /> p308). Ponnambalam, an English-educated Catholic lawyer who was elitist and abrasive by temperament justified this by pointing out that there were roughly equal numbers of English educated (i.e., upper caste) Sinhalese and Tamils, and that this would also guarantee a place of political parity for the Tamils.  Thus Ponnambalam proposed that the legislature should be: \"based on the balanced scheme of representation that would avoid the danger of concentration of power in one community, but would ensure its equitable distribution among all communities and the people as a whole\"(,<ref name=\"soulbury\">Soulbury Report, London, 1945</ref> p.&nbsp;92). Ponnambalam also proposed further constitutional mechanisms to \"safeguard minority rights\".\n\nPonnambalam's very artificial and unusual schemes for securing the continued parity of status of Tamils, completely contrary to the \"one man-one vote\" concept thoroughly accepted in European liberalism, met with severe disapprobation by the commissioners. They stated that \"any attempt by artificial means to convert a majority into a minority is not only inequitable, but doomed to failure\".<ref name=\"soulbury\" /> Ponnambalam's proposals were considered to be a means of conferring a minority supremacy amounting to virtual majority rule, and \"denial of the democratic principle\"(<ref name=\"jane\" />  p.&nbsp;311). The ''Hindu organ'', an influential newspaper of the time, condemned it as something that \"can only be maintained against the united opposition of the Sinhalese by British bayonets\".\n\n====Claims of Discrimination====\nThe submissions in front of the Soulbury commission also included specific grievances of the Ceylon Tamils regarding claimed unfair discrimination against their community. These included claims of discrimination in appointments to the Public Service,  claims of settlement policies in newly opened colonisation schemes which favour the Sinhalese, the Buddhist Temporalities act of 1931, the [[Anuradhapura]] Preservation Ordinance of 1931, the question of ports in the Northern peninsula, a claimed discriminatory bias in education, medical services etc., favouring the Sinhalese.\n\nHowever, the commission concluded that \"the evidence submitted to us provides no substantial indication of a general policy on the part of the Government of Ceylon of discrimination against minority communities\".\n\nThe extensive and lengthy orations of Ponnambalam were rewarded by the commissioners by introducing a provision for multi-member constituencies in suitable areas, allowing for greater representation for ethnic minorities like Tamils, Muslims and other groups. The commissioners also recommended inclusion of provisions relating to communal discrimination. The first was that \"the Parliament of Ceylon shall not make any law rendering persons of any community or religion liable to disabilities or restrictions to which persons of other communities are not made liable,&nbsp;...\". Another provision was that any bill which evoked \"serious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, in the opinion of the Governor-General is likely to involve oppression or serious injustice to any community must be reserved by the Governor-General\"(<ref name=\"soulbury\" /> p.&nbsp;101).\n\n===Kandyan Proposals===\nThe low-country Sinhalese and the Kandyans had largely co-operated in their politics during the 1930s. [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|Bandaranaike]]'s marriage to the Ratwatte family, influential in Kandyan circles, had also helped to bridge the gap between the two groups. However, the presence of a commission gave the Kandyan groups a chance to claim some powers for themselves, just as the Tamil Congress was largely arguing to secure Tamil interests.  The Kandyans proposed a Federal scheme where the Up-country region, the Low-country, and the North would be three federal states. Their suggestions were rejected by the commissioners who found no merit in the federal proposals.\n\n==Acceptance of the Soulbury Constitution==\nThe British historian Jane Russell argues that the official boycott of the Soulbury Commission by the Board of Ministers led by Senanayake was a \"statesman-like action, if not a diplomatic coup. The fact that the more&nbsp;... communal-minded (politicians) held aloof&nbsp;... , enabled the minorities to have the floor unchallenged. This manoeuvre avoided a repetition of the situation&nbsp;... of the Donoughmore Commission where there had been a spiraling of communal demands as accusations and denunciations (which) provoked counter-accusations,&nbsp;... until communal tension reached&nbsp;... in outbreaks of violence. (sic) It enabled G. G. Ponnambalam to strut about the political arena for a few months unimpeded\", while the Board of Ministers maintained a quiet dignity while doing behind-the-curtain politics. Thus the visit of the Soulbury Commission and the final Soulbury Report did much to reconcile the minority communities with the Sinhalese leadership under D. S. Senanayake. The voting in the third reading (in March) of the \"Free Lanka\" bill of January 1945, was supported by all the Muslim members, and by T. G. Rajakulendran, S. P. Vytilingam,  and V. Nalliah. Some of the other minority members who did not want to openly support the bill took care to be absent or abstain. Finally, the debate and the vote of acceptance on the eighth and ninth of September 1945 was the most significant indication of general reconciliation among the ethnic and regional groups. Far exceeding the 3/4 majority required by the Soulbury Commission, Senanayake had 51 votes in favour and only three votes against the adoption of the constitution. The vote was \"in many ways a vote of confidence by all communities in&nbsp;... Senanayake\", and the minorities were as anxious as the majority for self-government(<ref name=\"jane\" /> p 317, also,<ref>Ivor Jennings, The Constitution of Ceylon, Oxford University Press, 1949</ref> p.&nbsp;6).\n\nSenanayake's speech in proposing the motion of acceptance made reference to the minorities and said \"throughout this period the Ministers had in view one objective only, the attainment of maximum freedom. Accusations of Sinhalese domination have been bandied about. We can afford to ignore them for it must be plain to every one that what we sought was not Sinhalese domination, but Ceylonese domination. We devised a scheme that gave heavy weight to the minorities; we deliberately protected them against discriminatory legislation. We vested important powers in the Governor-General&nbsp;... We decided upon an Independent Public Service Commission so as to give assurance that there should be no communalism in the Public Srvice.(sic) I do not normally speak as a Sinhalese, and I do not think that the Leader of this Council ought to think of himself as a Sinhalese representative, but for once I should like to speak as a Sinhalese and assert with all the force at my command that the interests of one community are the interests of all. We are one of another, what ever race or creed.\"<ref>Hansard, State Council of Ceylon 1945</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended, D. S. Senanayake was ready, on a mission to Whitehall to push for full dominion status instead of the status discussed in the 1943 Colonial secretary's report. During August\u2013September 1945 Senanayake argued that the limits on Ceylon's external sovereignty (defence and external affairs), adhered to by the Soulbury report were unworkable and unnecessary. Senanayake suggested the confirmation of Dominion status by an Order in Council, and delivered a draft to G. H. Hall, the new Secretary to the Colonies.
