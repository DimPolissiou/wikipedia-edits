System of a Down has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]], and their song \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010; since then, they have performed live occasionally despite having not released any new material since the ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]]'' and ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' albums in 2005. System of a Down has sold over 40 million records worldwide, while two of their singles \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\" and \"[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]\" reached number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Soil (1992\u201394) ===\nSerj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended [[Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School]] as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio.<ref>Meyers, Ben. ''System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood'' (2007), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> They formed a band named ''Soil'' with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in [[The Apex Theory]]/[[Mt. Helium]]) on bass and Domingo \"Dingo\" Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.\n\n=== Demo tapes and signing (1994\u201397) ===\nAfter Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled \"Victims of a Down\".<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\">{{cite web |title=OnTroniK: System of a Down Information |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |access-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220180824/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |archive-date=February 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The word \"victims\" was changed to \"system\" because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, [[Slayer]]. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to [[Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group]] and its founder David \"Beno\" Benveniste.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview With David 'Beno' Benveniste |work=lamusicblog.com |date=March 13, 2011 |url=http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref> The band recruited drummer [[Ontronik Khachaturian|Ontronik \"Andy\" Khachaturian]], an old school friend of Malakian and Odadjian, who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" />\n\nIn early 1995, System played as \"Soil\" at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in [[Los Angeles]]. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> Khachaturian was replaced by [[John Dolmayan]].\n\nThe band's first official, professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' (\"we're Armenian\" in English), an [[Armenian Genocide]] recognition compilation, in 1997. After playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky-A-Go-Go]] and [[Viper Room]], the band attracted the attention of producer [[Rick Rubin]], who asked them to keep in touch. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]]. Rubin signed the group to his [[American Recordings (record label)|American/Columbia Records]] and, with engineer [[Sylvia Massy]], System began laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album. \"I loved them,\" Rubin recalled. \"They were my favourite band, but I didn't think anyone was going to like them apart from a small, likeminded group of people like me who were crazy. No one was waiting for an Armenian heavy metal band. It had to be so good that it transcended all of that.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.<ref name=\"rc_awards_97\">{{cite web |title=Rock City Awards 1997 |work=rockcitynews.com |url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Self-titled album (1998\u20132000) ===\nIn June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, ''[[System of a Down (album)|System of a Down]]''. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles \"[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]\" and \"[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]\" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.\n\nIn November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park]]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song \"Will They Die 4 You?\" Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, \"Why must we kill our own kind?\" a line that would later be used in the song \"Boom!\" Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does every other artist featured on the record.\n\nSystem of a Down's former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the [[Black Sabbath]] song \"[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]\" to the Black Sabbath tribute album ''[[Nativity in Black 2]].''\n\n=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!'' (2001\u201303) ===\n[[File:Daron Malakian 1.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Daron Malakian]] met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1993 before forming the band a year later.]]\nOn September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a \"thank you\" to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read \"System of a Down\" was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David \"Beno\" Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down's scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-wraiths-dark-punk-isnt-all-doom-and-gloom-9209187|title=The Wraith's Dark Punk Isn't All Doom and Gloom|last=Rogers|first=Paul|date=2018-03-02|work=L.A.

The album has eventually achieved 3x [[multi-platinum]] certification in the United States<ref name=RIAAcert>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=toxicity#search_section|title=RIAA album certifications: System of a Down - Toxicity|publisher=|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> It was still on top in America during the week of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album's hit single \"[[Chop Suey!]]\" The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics according to the [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum]] at the time such as \"(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide.\" Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album's second single, \"[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]\". Even with the controversy surrounding \"Chop Suey!\" (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with \"Toxicity\" and \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\". In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed \"Toxicity\" in the number 14 slot in the ''40 Greatest Metal Songs''.\n\nIn 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.\n\nIn late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|author=Mike Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081821/http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'' as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song \"[[Innervision]]\" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for \"Boom!\" was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].\n\n=== ''Mezmerize'', ''Hypnotize'' and separation (2004\u201306) ===\n[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.]]\nBetween 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'', a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down's second No. 1 album. First week sales exceeded 800,000 copies worldwide. The lead single \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\", which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts, and would go on to win the [[48th_Annual_Grammy_Awards#Rock|2006 Grammy Award]] for Best Hard Rock Performance. \"[[Question!]]\" was released as the next single, with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the album's release, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Bad Acid Trip]] supporting.\n\nThe second part of the double album, ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]],'' was released on November 22, 2005. Like ''Mezmerize'' it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with [[The Beatles]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and rappers [[2Pac]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1516656/system-of-a-down-make-it-a-double-with-chart-topping-hypnotize/|title=System Of A Down Make It A Double With Chart-Topping Hypnotize|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en}}</ref>. [[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]] was released as the lead single, and was followed by [[Lonely Day]] and [[Vicinity of Obscenity]], both of which were also released as [[Extended play|EPs]] including several previously-unreleased cover songs as well as a collaboration with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. [[Kill Rock 'N Roll]] was released as the final promotional single. \n\nWhereas on System of a Down's previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'' were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.\n\nSystem of a Down's song \"[[Lonely Day]]\" was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Grammy Awards]] in 2007, but lost to \"[[Woman (Wolfmother song)|Woman]]\" by [[Wolfmother]].\n\nMay 2006 saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled ''System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood'' by writer [[Ben Myers]]. It was published in the US in 2007 through [[The Disinformation Company]]. Also in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were featured in the film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with (then) Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in ''Screamers''.\n\nIn May also, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, \"We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things.

After one [[Scars on Broadway (album)|self-titled album]] the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. However, the band released their long-awaited [[Dictator (album)|sophomore album]] in 2018, under the name Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator, as well as opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store. Odadjian pursued his project with [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip-hop group named [[Achozen|AcHoZeN]], worked on his urSESSION website/record label, and performed as a member of funk legend [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s backing band. Tankian opted for solo career and released his debut solo album ''[[Elect the Dead]]'' in the autumn of 2007.

System of a Down has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]], and their song \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010; since then, they have performed live occasionally despite having not released any new material since the ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]]'' and ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]]'' albums in 2005. System of a Down has sold over 40 million records worldwide, while two of their singles \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\" and \"[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]\" reached number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Alternative Songs]] chart.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Soil (1992\u201394) ===\nSerj Tankian and Daron Malakian attended [[Rose and Alex Pilibos Armenian School]] as children, although due to their eight-year age difference they did not meet until 1992 while working on separate projects at the same recording studio.<ref>Meyers, Ben. ''System Of A Down: Right Here In Hollywood'' (2007), p.&nbsp;14.</ref> They formed a band named ''Soil'' with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan (who later played in [[The Apex Theory]]/[[Mt. Helium]]) on bass and Domingo \"Dingo\" Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian (another Rose and Alex Pilibos alumnus) as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.\n\n=== Demo tapes and signing (1994\u201397) ===\nAfter Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled \"Victims of a Down\".<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\">{{cite web |title=OnTroniK: System of a Down Information |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |access-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220180824/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=512654515&blogId=526325472 |archive-date=February 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The word \"victims\" was changed to \"system\" because Odadjian believed that it would appeal to a much wider audience and also because the group wanted their records to be alphabetically shelved closer to their musical heroes, [[Slayer]]. Odadjian switched from guitar to bass and passed on his managerial duties to [[Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group]] and its founder David \"Beno\" Benveniste.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview With David 'Beno' Benveniste |work=lamusicblog.com |date=March 13, 2011 |url=http://lamusicblog.com/2011/03/industry-profile/interview-with-beno-of-velvet-hammer |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref> The band recruited drummer [[Ontronik Khachaturian|Ontronik \"Andy\" Khachaturian]], an old school friend of Malakian and Odadjian, who had played with Malakian in a band called Snowblind during their teens.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" />\n\nIn early 1995, System played as \"Soil\" at the Cafe Club Fais Do-Do, a nightclub in [[Los Angeles]]. Shortly after the event, System of a Down made what is known as ''Untitled 1995 Demo Tape'', which was not commercially released but appeared on file sharing networks around the time of the band's success with ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'' about six years later. ''Demo Tape 2'' was released in 1996. At the beginning of 1997, System of a Down recorded their final publicly released demo tape, ''Demo Tape 3''. In mid-1997, drummer Khachaturian left the band because of a hand injury (he subsequently co-founded The Apex Theory, which included former Soil bassist Dave Hakopyan).<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> Khachaturian was replaced by [[John Dolmayan]].\n\nThe band's first official, professionally recorded song was on a collection called ''Hye Enk'' (\"we're Armenian\" in English), an [[Armenian Genocide]] recognition compilation, in 1997. After playing at notable Hollywood clubs such as the [[Whisky-A-Go-Go]] and [[Viper Room]], the band attracted the attention of producer [[Rick Rubin]], who asked them to keep in touch. Showing great interest, the group recorded ''Demo Tape 4'' near the end of 1997, specifically to be sent to [[Record label|record companies]]. Rubin signed the group to his [[American Recordings (record label)|American/Columbia Records]] and, with engineer [[Sylvia Massy]], System began laying down tracks that would eventually be released on their debut album. \"I loved them,\" Rubin recalled. \"They were my favourite band, but I didn't think anyone was going to like them apart from a small, likeminded group of people like me who were crazy. No one was waiting for an Armenian heavy metal band. It had to be so good that it transcended all of that.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The Q Interview: Rick Rubin|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=October 2009|page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the group won the Best Signed Band Award from the Rock City Awards.<ref name=\"rc_awards_97\">{{cite web |title=Rock City Awards 1997 |work=rockcitynews.com |url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/awards/ballot97.html |accessdate=July 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Self-titled album (1998\u20132000) ===\nIn June 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, ''[[System of a Down (album)|System of a Down]]''. They enjoyed moderate success as their first singles \"[[Sugar (System of a Down song)|Sugar]]\" and \"[[Spiders (System of a Down song)|Spiders]]\" became radio favorites and the music videos for both songs were frequently aired on MTV. After the release of the album, the band toured extensively, opening for Slayer and [[Metallica]] before making their way to the second stage of [[Ozzfest]]. Following Ozzfest, they toured with [[Fear Factory]] and [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] before headlining the [[Sno-Core Tour]] with [[Puya (band)|Puya]], [[Mr. Bungle]], The Cat and Incubus providing support.\n\nIn November 1998, System of a Down appeared on [[South Park]]'s ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album|Chef Aid]]'' album, providing the music for the song \"Will They Die 4 You?\" Near the end of the song Tankian can be heard saying, \"Why must we kill our own kind?\" a line that would later be used in the song \"Boom!\" Although System of a Down is credited on the album, South Park character [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] does not introduce them as he does every other artist featured on the record.\n\nSystem of a Down's former drummer, Ontronik Khachaturian, briefly reunited with the band at a show at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in 1999, filling in on vocals for an ill Tankian.<ref name=\"blogs.myspace.com\" /> In 2000, the band contributed their cover of the [[Black Sabbath]] song \"[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]\" to the Black Sabbath tribute album ''[[Nativity in Black 2]].''\n\n=== ''Toxicity'' and ''Steal This Album!'' (2001\u201303) ===\n[[File:Daron Malakian 1.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Daron Malakian]] met Serj Tankian for the first time in 1993 before forming the band a year later.]]\nOn September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a \"thank you\" to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read \"System of a Down\" was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the band's touring gear (approximately $30,000 worth of equipment) and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The band's manager, David \"Beno\" Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Down's scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-wraiths-dark-punk-isnt-all-doom-and-gloom-9209187|title=The Wraith's Dark Punk Isn't All Doom and Gloom|last=Rogers|first=Paul|date=2018-03-02|work=L.A.

The album has eventually achieved 3x [[multi-platinum]] certification in the United States<ref name=RIAAcert>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=toxicity#search_section|title=RIAA album certifications: System of a Down - Toxicity|publisher=|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> It was still on top in America during the week of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding the album's hit single \"[[Chop Suey!]]\" The song was taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics according to the [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum]] at the time such as \"(I don't think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide.\" Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the album's second single, \"[[Toxicity (song)|Toxicity]]\". Even with the controversy surrounding \"Chop Suey!\" (which earned a Grammy nomination), System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with \"Toxicity\" and \"[[Aerials (song)|Aerials]]\". In May 2006, [[VH1]] listed \"Toxicity\" in the number 14 slot in the ''40 Greatest Metal Songs''.\n\nIn 2001, the band went on tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] throughout the United States and Mexico. Following a performance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Odadjian was allegedly harassed, ethnically intimidated, and was physically assaulted by security guards backstage, who then dragged him out of the venue. Odadjian received medical attention from police and later filed a suit against the security company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470460/20030310/system_of_a_down.jhtml|title=System Of A Down Bassist Sues Security Team For Humiliating Him In Front Of Fans|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Despite the incident, the tour was a success and System of a Down and Slipknot went on the Pledge of Allegiance Tour with [[Rammstein]] in 2001.\n\nIn late 2001, unreleased tracks from the ''Toxicity'' sessions made their way onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|title=The Daron Malakian Interview|author=Mike Lancaster|date=March 28, 2003|publisher=Glendale High School Newspaper-the Explosion|access-date=July 26, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081821/http://www.glendalehigh.com/malakian.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This collection of tracks was dubbed ''Toxicity II'' by fans. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material and subsequently released the final versions of the songs as their third album, ''[[Steal This Album!]]'', which was released in November 2002. ''Steal This Album!'' resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s counter-culture book, ''[[Steal This Book]]'' as well as a message to those who leaked the songs onto the internet. The song \"[[Innervision]]\" was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for \"Boom!\" was filmed with director [[Michael Moore]] as a protest against the [[War in Iraq]].\n\n=== ''Mezmerize'', ''Hypnotize'' and separation (2004\u201306) ===\n[[File:Serj Tankian.jpg|thumb|[[Serj Tankian]] has gained a reputation for his large vocal range along with his unusual delivery.]]\nBetween 2004 and 2005, the group recorded the follow-up to ''Steal This Album!'', a double album, which they released as separate installments six months apart. The releases notably included album cover artwork by Malakian's father, Vartan Malakian, and were designed to connect the two separate album covers. The first album, ''[[Mezmerize (album)|Mezmerize]],'' was released on May 17, 2005 to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of A Down's second No. 1 album. First week sales exceeded 800,000 copies worldwide. The lead single \"[[B.Y.O.B. (song)|B.Y.O.B.]]\", which questions the integrity of military recruiting in America, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts, and would go on to win the [[48th_Annual_Grammy_Awards#Rock|2006 Grammy Award]] for Best Hard Rock Performance. \"[[Question!]]\" was released as the next single, with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the album's release, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Bad Acid Trip]] supporting.\n\nThe second part of the double album, ''[[Hypnotize (album)|Hypnotize]],'' was released on November 22, 2005. Like ''Mezmerize'' it debuted at No. 1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with [[The Beatles]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and rappers [[2Pac]] and [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at No. 1 in the same year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1516656/system-of-a-down-make-it-a-double-with-chart-topping-hypnotize/|title=System Of A Down Make It A Double With Chart-Topping Hypnotize|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en}}</ref>. [[Hypnotize (song)|Hypnotize]] was released as the lead single, and was followed by [[Lonely Day]] and [[Vicinity of Obscenity]], both of which were also released as [[Extended play|EPs]] including several previously-unreleased cover songs as well as a collaboration with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. [[Kill Rock 'N Roll]] was released as the final promotional single. \n\nWhereas on System of a Down's previous albums most of the lyrics were written and sung by Tankian and the music was co-written by Tankian and Malakian (and sometimes Odadjian), much of the music and lyrics on ''Mezmerize''/''Hypnotize'' were written by Malakian who also took on a much more dominant role as vocalist on both albums, often leaving Tankian providing keyboards and backing vocals.\n\nSystem of a Down's song \"[[Lonely Day]]\" was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance in the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Grammy Awards]] in 2007, but lost to \"[[Woman (Wolfmother song)|Woman]]\" by [[Wolfmother]].\n\nMay 2006 saw the UK publication of a biography of the band entitled ''System of a Down: Right Here in Hollywood'' by writer [[Ben Myers]]. It was published in the US in 2007 through [[The Disinformation Company]]. Also in 2006, concert footage and interviews with the band concerning the importance of helping create awareness and recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] were featured in the film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]],'' directed by [[Carla Garapedian]]. An interview with Tankian's grandfather, a survivor of the Genocide, was also included in the film as well as Tankian's and Dolmayan's meeting with (then) Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] during which the two musicians campaigned for the United States government's official recognition of the Genocide. Footage of Tankian and Dolmayan marching with protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington D.C. was also used in ''Screamers''.\n\nIn May also, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Malakian confirmed the break would probably last a few years, which Odadjian specified as a minimum of three years in an interview with ''Guitar'' magazine. He told MTV, \"We're not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn't be doing this Ozzfest. We're going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We've done System for over ten years, and I think it's healthy to take some rest.\"<ref>{{Cite news  |last=Harris |first=Chris |date=May 3, 2006 |title=System of a Down Aren't Breaking Up\u2014They're Going on Hiatus|work=MTV News |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/20060503/system_of_a_down.jhtml |accessdate=February 2, 2009}}</ref> System of a Down's final performance before their separation took place on August 13, 2006 in [[West Palm Beach]], Florida. \"Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together,\" Malakian told the crowd during Sunday's last performance. \"We'll be back.

After one [[Scars on Broadway (album)|self-titled album]] the project became dormant and Dolmayan left the band. However, the band released their long-awaited [[Dictator (album)|sophomore album]] in 2018, under the name Daron Malakian and Scars On Broadway. Dolmayan, alongside working with Scars on Broadway, formed his own band, Indicator, as well as opened Torpedo Comics, an online comic book store. Odadjian pursued his project with [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]], a hip-hop group named [[Achozen|AcHoZeN]], worked on his urSESSION website/record label, and performed as a member of funk legend [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s backing band. Tankian opted for solo career and released his debut solo album ''[[Elect the Dead]]'' in the autumn of 2007. He has continued releasing solo albums, recording them almost entirely by himself, after System of a Down reunited.\n\n=== Reunion and touring (2010\u201315) ===\nOn November 29, 2010, following several weeks of Internet rumors, System of a Down officially announced that they would be reuniting for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=Karan |first=Tim |title=System Of A Down to reunite, headline Download Festival |work=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date=November 29, 2010 |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/system_of_a_down_to_reunite_co-headline_download_festival_with_avenged_seve/ |access-date=November 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001082758/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/system_of_a_down_to_reunite_co-headline_download_festival_with_avenged_seve/# |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Among the announced tour dates included UK's [[Download Festival]], Switzerland's [[Greenfield Festival]], Germany's [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring/Rock im Park]], Sweden's [[Metaltown]], Austria's [[Nova Rock Festival]] and Finland's [[Provinssirock]].

Salsa is the product of various Cuban musical genres including the Afro-Cuban [[son montuno]], [[guaracha]], [[cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha cha ch\u00e1]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], and to a certain extent [[bolero]] and the Puerto Rican [[Plena]] and [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|Bomba]]. [[Latin jazz]], which was also developed in New York City, has had a significant influence on salsa arrangers, piano [[guajeo]]s, and instrumental soloists.<ref>Gerard 1989, pp. 8\u20139. \"From jazz came a harmonic vocabulary based on extended harmonies of altered and unaltered ninths, elevenths and thirteenths, as well as quartal harmony\u2014chords built on fourths. These harmonic devices entered salsa in the piano styles of Eddie Palmieri and the Puerto Rican Papo Lucca. They would take traditional piano figures based on simple tonic-dominant harmony and elaborate them with modern harmonies. These modern harmonies are now a staple of salsa arrangers such as Marty Sheller and Oscar Hern\u00e1ndez.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://blog.pimsleur.com/2018/11/28/pimsleur-guide-to-latin-music-salsa/ |title= Origins of Salsa Music|website=Pimsleur.com}}</ref>\n\nSalsa is primarily Cuban [[son (music)|son]], itself a fusion of [[Music of Spain|Spanish]] [[canci\u00f3n]] and guitar and [[Afro-Cuban percussion]], merged with [[Puertorican]] bomba and plena as well as music styles such as [[jazz]]. Salsa also occasionally incorporates elements of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[funk]].<ref>Morales 2003, p. 33. Morales writes that \"While many Afro-Cuban music purists continue to claim that salsa is a mere variation on Cuba's musical heritage, the hybridizing experience the music went through in New York from the 1920s on incorporated influences from many different branches of the Latin American tradition, and later from jazz, R&B, and even rock.\" Morales' claim is confirmed by Unterberger's and Steward's analysis.</ref> All of these non-Cuban elements are grafted onto the basic Cuban son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1993, p. 215. Maule\u00f3n codifies this approach with examples of bomba, plena, and merengue arrangements for salsa ensemble. When adapting these non-Cuban rhythms to salsa it is common to alter them in order to fit into the Cuban template. For example, Maule\u00f3n's merengue chart includes clave, which is essential to Cuban popular music, although it is not a component of the traditional Dominican rhythm.</ref>\n\nThe first salsa bands were predominantly [[Cuba|Cubans]] and [[Puerto Ricans]].<ref>Boggs 1992, pp. 187-193</ref><ref>Hutchinson 2004, p. 116. Hutchinson says salsa music and dance \"both originated with Cuban rhythms that were brought to New York and adopted, adapted, reformulated, and made new by the Puerto Ricans living there.\"</ref><ref>Catapano 2011. \"Although a great number of New York's stars and sidemen in the 1970s were Cuban and Puerto Rican, the basic musical elements of salsa were derived mainly from Cuba.\"</ref> The music eventually spread throughout [[Cali|Colombia]] and the rest of the Americas.<ref name=\"Manuel46\">Manuel, ''Popular Music of the Non-Western World'', p. 46</ref> Ultimately, it became a global phenomenon. Some of the founding salsa artists were [[Johnny Pacheco]] (the creator of the [[Fania All-Stars]]), [[Celia Cruz]], [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]], [[Richie Ray]], [[Bobby Cruz]], [[Ray Barretto]], [[Willie Col\u00f3n]], [[Larry Harlow (salsa)|Larry Harlow]], [[Roberto Roena]], [[Bobby Valent\u00edn]], [[Eddie Palmieri]], and [[H\u00e9ctor Lavoe]].<ref name=\"Unterberger, p. 50\">Unterberger, p. 50</ref>\n\n==Salsa as a musical term==\n''Salsa'' means '[[sauce]]' in the [[Spanish language]], and carries connotations of the spiciness common in Latin and Caribbean cuisine.<ref>Waxer 2002, p. 6</ref> In the 20th century, ''salsa'' acquired a musical meaning in both English and Spanish. In this sense ''salsa'' has been described as a word with \"vivid associations\".<ref name=Steward488>Steward 2000, p. 488. [[Celia Cruz]] said, \"salsa is Cuban music with another name. It's mambo, chachach\u00e1, rumba, son ... all the Cuban rhythms under one name.\"</ref> Cubans and Puerto Ricans in New York have used the term analogously to [[Swing (genre)|swing]] or [[soul music]]. In this usage ''salsa'' connotes a frenzied, \"hot\" and wild musical experience that draws upon or reflects elements of Latin culture, regardless of the style.<ref>Jones and Kantonen, 2000. \"The word ''salsa'' ('spicy sauce') had long been used by Cuban immigrants as something analogous to the term ''swing''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Manuel, p. 46\">Manuel 1990, [https://archive.org/details/popularmusicsofn0000manu/page/46 p. 46]. \"On one level, as Singer and Friedman note, salsa is to Latinos as 'soul' is to blacks; salsa\u2014literally, 'hot sauce'\u2014spicy, zesty, energetic, and unmistakably Latino.\"</ref>\n\nVarious music writers and historians have traced the use of ''salsa'' to different periods of the 20th century. [[Max Salazar]] traces the word back to the early 1930s, when [[Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro]] composed \"\u00c9chale salsita\", a Cuban ''[[son (music)|son]]'' protesting tasteless food.<ref>Salazar 1991; Waxer 2002, p. 6; Morales 2003, pp. 56\u201359. Morales dates the song to 1932.</ref> While Salazar describes this song as the origin of ''salsa'' meaning \"danceable Latin music\", Ed Morales describes the usage in the same song as a cry from Pi\u00f1eiro to his band, telling them to increase the tempo to \"put the dancers into high gear\".<ref name=Morales56>Morales 2003, p. 56</ref> Morales claims that later in the 1930s, vocalist [[Beny Mor\u00e9]] would shout ''salsa'' during a performance \"to acknowledge a musical moment's heat, to express a kind of cultural nationalist sloganeering [and to celebrate the] 'hotness' or 'spiciness' of Latin American cultures\".<ref name=Morales56/> World music author Sue Steward claims ''salsa'' was originally used in music as a \"cry of appreciation for a particularly piquant or flashy solo\".<ref name=Steward488/> She cites the first use in this manner to a Venezuelan radio DJ named [[Phidias Danilo Escalona]];<ref name=Steward488/><ref>Waxer 2002, p. 6; Rond\u00f3n 1980, p. 33</ref> In 1955 [[Cheo Marquetti]] created a new band called Conjunto Los Salseros and recorded some new songs (Sonero and Que no muera el son).  In 1955 [[Jos\u00e9 Curbelo]] recorded some other salsa songs (La familia, La la la and Sun sun sun ba bae).\nThe contemporary meaning of ''salsa'' as a musical genre can be traced back to New York City Latin music promoter [[Izzy Sanabria]]:<ref>Boggs 1992, pp. 187-193.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In 1973, I hosted the television show ''Salsa'' which was the first reference to this particular music as ''salsa''. I was using [the term] ''salsa'', but the music wasn't defined by that. The music was still defined as Latin music. And that was a very, very broad category, because it even includes mariachi music. It includes everything. So salsa defined this particular type of music ... It's a name that everyone could pronounce.<ref>Boggs 1992, p. 190</ref></blockquote>\n\nSanabria's ''Latin New York'' magazine was an English language publication. Consequently, his promoted events were covered in ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines. They reported on this \"new\" phenomenon taking New York by storm\u2014''salsa''.<ref>Boggs 1992, p. 192. Izzy Sanabria: \"In Santo Domingo ... they told me that they don't recognize a Dominican artist as having made it in New York City unless a photograph and something written on this artist appears in ''Latin New York''. I said 'but why?' And what he said: 'Because we consider ''Latin New York'' a North American publication.' You see what I mean? In other words, it's an American publication. It was in English. So because it was in English, because it was from America, then it's legitimate. That in a sense, was the major impact of ''Latin New York''.\"</ref>\n\nBut promotion certainly wasn't the only factor in the music's success, as Sanabria makes clear: \"Musicians were busy creating the music but played no role in promoting the name salsa.\"<ref name=\"Izzy Sanabria 2005\">Izzy Sanabria 2005</ref> Johnny Pacheco, the creative director and producer of Fania Records, molded New York salsa into a tight, polished and commercially successful sound. The unprecedented appeal of New York salsa, particularly the \"Fania sound\", led to its adoption across Latin America and elsewhere.\n\nGlobally, the term salsa has eclipsed the original names of the various Cuban musical genres it encompasses. Ironically, Cuban-based music was promoted more effectively worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s by the salsa industry, than by Cuba. For a brief time in the early 1990s a fair number of Cuban musicians embraced the term, calling their own music ''salsa Cubana''.<ref name=\"Maule\u00f3n 1999, p. 80\">Maule\u00f3n 1999, p. 80</ref> The practice did not catch on however.\n\n==Issues of identity and ownership==\n[[File:Machito and his sister Graciella Grillo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Graciela]] on [[claves]] and her brother [[Machito]] on [[maraca]]s; Machito said that ''salsa'' was much like what he had been playing from the 1940s.]]\nThere is considerable controversy surrounding the term salsa and the idea that it is its own distinct genre. Several Cuban New York musicians who had already been performing Cuban dance music for decades when salsa was popularized initially scoffed at the term. For example, Cuban-born [[Machito]] declared: \"There's nothing new about salsa, it is just the same old music that was played in Cuba for over fifty years.\"<ref name=\"Izzy Sanabria 2005\"/> Similarly, New York native [[Tito Puente]] stated: \"The only salsa I know is sold in a bottle called ketchup. I play Cuban music.\"<ref name=Aparicio65/> Eventually though, both Machito and Puente embraced the term as a financial necessity.<ref>In 1983, Machito won a Grammy Award in the Best Latin Recording category for ''Machito and his Salsa Big Band '82'' Timeless CD 168.</ref><ref>Izzy Sanabria 2005. \"Years later, [Tito] Puente told me, 'Izzy you remember how much I hated and resisted the term salsa? Well I've had to accept it because wherever I travel, I find my records under the category of salsa.'\"</ref>\n\nThe salsa conflict can be summarized as a disagreement between those who do not recognize salsa as anything other than Cuban music with another name,<ref name=Steward488/><ref name=Aparicio65>Aparicio 1998, p. 65. [[P\u00e9rez Prado]]: \"There is no such thing as salsa.\"<br />[[Willie Col\u00f3n]]: \"Salsa is the harmonic sum of all Latin culture that meets in New York.\"<br />Concierto Expo 92, Seville, Spain: \"Salsa is Puerto Rico.\"</ref> and those who strongly identify with salsa as a music and culture distinct from its Cuban primogenitor.<ref name=Aparicio65/>\n\nThe concept of ''salsa music'' which began as a marketing ploy created by Izzy Sanabria was successfully exploited by Fania Records, then eventually took on a life of its own, organically evolving into an authentic pan-Latin American cultural identity. Music professor and salsa trombonist Christopher Washburne writes:\n\n<blockquote>This pan-Latino association of salsa stems from what Felix Padilla labels a 'Latinizing' process that occurred in the 1960s and was consciously marketed by Fania Records: 'To Fania, the Latinizing of salsa came to mean homogenizing the product, presenting an all-embracing Puerto Rican, Pan-American or Latino sound with which the people from all of Latin America and Spanish-speaking communities in the United States could identify and purchase.' Motivated primarily by economic factors, Fania's push for countries throughout Latin America to embrace salsa did result in an expanded market. But in addition, throughout the 1970s, salsa groups from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, among other Latin American nations, emerged, composing and performing music that related to their own specific cultural experiences and affiliations, which posited salsa as a cultural identity marker for those nations as well.<ref>Washburne 2008, p. 105</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Cuban origins of the music do not conveniently fit into the pan-Latino narrative. Many leading salsa artists have described salsa in broad and inclusive, but vague terms, making no mention of the music's Cuban foundation. For example, Johnny Pacheco has consistently articulated a vision of salsa as a broad, multi-ethnic movement: \"Salsa was, and still is, a Caribbean musical movement.\"<ref>Steward 1999, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Similarly, [[Willie Col\u00f3n]] sees the scope of salsa's power to unite in the broadest terms: \"Salsa was the force that united diverse Latino and other non-Latino racial and ethnic groups ... It is a concept. An open, ever-evolving musical, cultural, socio-political concept.\"<ref>Fuentes 2003, p. 59</ref> Rub\u00e9n Blades' definition of salsa is also inclusive: \"Salsa music is urban folklore at the international level.\"<ref name=Aparicio65/> Journalist Scott Heller writes, \"[Salsa music] circulates across national boundaries, becoming a useful example of the globalization of culture and of the ways that people build community in diaspora.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Salsa: a Hybrid Form That Reflects the Globalization of Culture|last=Heller|first=Scott|date=May 1, 1998|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=}}</ref> As an example of this, ethnomusicologist Ed Morales notes that the interaction of Latino rhythms and Jazz music in mid-twentieth century New York was crucial to the innovation of both forms of music. Musicians who would become great innovators of Salsa, like Mario Bauza and [[Chano Pozo]], began their careers in New York working in close conjunction with some of the biggest names in Jazz, like Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, and Dizzy Gillespie, among others, Morales noted that: \"The interconnection between North American jazz and Afro-Cuban music was taken for granted, and the stage was set for the emergence of mambo music in New York, where music fans were becoming accustomed to innovation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Latin Beat: Rhythms and Roots of Latin Music from Bossa Nova to Salsa and Beyond|last=Morales|first=Ed|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0306810183|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/latinbeatrhythms00mora_0/page/41 41]|url=https://archive.org/details/latinbeatrhythms00mora_0/page/41}}</ref> He later notes that Mambo helped pave the way for the widespread acceptance of Salsa years later. In the pivotal documentary movie ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in Cities'' (1979), the history of salsa is explained as a mixing of African, Caribbean, and New York cultures and musics, with no mention of Cuba. In one scene, the Afro-Cuban folkloric genres of bat\u00e1 and rumba are shown being performed in Puerto Rico, implying that they originated there.\n\nIn advancing the concept of salsa as a musical \"sauce\", containing many different ingredients from various cultures mixed together, some point to the occasional use of non-Cuban forms in salsa, such as the Puerto Rican bomba. The percentage of salsa compositions based in non-Cuban genres is low though, and despite an openness to experimentation and a willingness to absorb non-Cuban influences, - such as Jazz and of Rock and Roll, with regards to formal structure, and many other informal influences from talented musicians of a broad range of musical and ethnic backgrounds; such as Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Italians and Jews: anyone with talent and the will to experiment<ref>{{Cite book|title=Faces of Salsa: A Spoken History of the Music|last=Fuentes|first=Leonardo|publisher=Smithsonian Books|year=2003|isbn=978-1588340801|location=|pages=}}</ref> - salsa has remained consistently wedded to its Cuban templates.<ref>Gerard 1989, p. 7. The popularity of Puerto Rican t\u00edpica music peaked in New York City in 1957, more than a decade before the emergence of salsa. \"It is ironic that in a music dominated by Nuyorican and Puerto Rican musicians, the use of the folk music of Puerto Rico has never been very popular. According to Frankie Malabe, 'In a live performance ... you'll rarely get any bombas and plenas.'\"</ref> It was common practice for salsa bands to resurrect pre-salsa Cuban classics. For example, several of [[Arsenio Rodriguez]]'s son montunos from the 1940s, such as \"Fuego en el 23\" (recorded by [[Sonora Ponce\u00f1a]]) and \"El divorcio\" (recorded by [[Johnny Pacheco]]) were modernized by salsa arrangers. The pan-Latin Americanism of salsa is found in its cultural milieu, more than its musical structure.<ref>Washburne 2008, p. 40. Washburne notes that Willie Col\u00f3n is an exception. He advocated a broader Latin American identity, while creating salsa that deliberately drew upon a variety of Latin American and Caribbean musics.</ref> Today, competing nationalities claim ownership of the music, as there are musicians in New York City, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela, who claim salsa was invented in their country.<ref>The five-part VHS series ''Salsa'' (Bongo Video Productions, London, c. early 1990s) interviews people from Cuba, New York City, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela, all of whom claim that salsa was invented in their country.</ref>\n\nThe salsa controversy is also closely tied to the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the [[United States embargo against Cuba]]. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from [[Cuban exile]]s) for playing Cuban records over the air.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana|last=Bardach|first=Ann Louise|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9780307425423|location=|pages=112}}</ref> Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term ''salsa music'' was a euphemism for authentic [[Cuban music]] stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 494</ref>\n\n[[Mayra Mart\u00ednez]], a Cuban musicologist, writes that \"the term ''salsa'' was used to obscure the Cuban base, the music's history or part of its history in Cuba. And salsa was a way to do this so that Jerry Masucci, Fania and other record companies, like CBS, could have a hegemony on the music and keep the Cuban musicians from spreading their music abroad.\"<ref name=Boggs189/> Izzy Sanabria responds that Mart\u00ednez was likely giving an accurate Cuban viewpoint, \"but salsa was not planned that way\".<ref name=Boggs189>Boggs 1992, p. 189</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\nSalsa lyrics range from simple dance numbers, and sentimental romantic songs, to risque and politically radical subject matter. Music author [[Isabelle Leymarie]] notes that salsa performers often incorporate [[macho]]istic [[wikt:bravado|bravado]] (''guaper\u00eda'') in their lyrics, in a manner reminiscent of [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[samba music|samba]], a theme she ascribes to the performers' \"humble backgrounds\" and subsequent need to compensate for their origins. Leymarie claims that salsa is \"essentially virile, an affirmation of the man's pride and identity\". As an extension of salsa's macho stance, manly taunts and challenges (''desafio'') are also a traditional part of salsa.<ref name=\"Leymarie, pp. 268-269\">Leymarie, pp. 268-269</ref>\n\nSalsa lyrics often quote from traditional Cuban sones and rumbas. Sometimes there are references to Afro-Cuban religions, such as ''[[Santeria]]'', even by artists who are not themselves practitioners of the faith.<ref>Steward, pp. 495-496 Steward mentions Celia Cruz as not being an adherent of Santeria, yet who refers to the goddess [[Yemaya]] in her performances.</ref> Salsa lyrics also exhibit Puerto Rican influences. Hector LaVoe, who sang with Willie Col\u00f3n for nearly a decade used typical Puerto Rican phrasing in his singing.<ref>Gerard 1989 p. 7</ref> It's not uncommon now to hear the Puerto Rican declamatory exclamation \"le-lo-lai\" in salsa.<ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', p. 74</ref> Politically and socially activist composers have long been an important part of salsa, and some of their works, like Eddie Palmieri's \"La libertad - l\u00f3gico\", became Latin, and especially Puerto Rican anthems. The Panamanian-born singer [[Rub\u00e9n Blades|Ruben Blades]] in particular is well known for his socially-conscious and incisive salsa lyrics about everything from [[imperialism]] to [[disarmament]] and [[environmentalism]], which have resonated with audiences throughout Latin America.<ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pg. 80</ref> Many salsa songs contain a nationalist theme, centered around a sense of pride in black Latino identity, and may be in Spanish, English or a mixture of the two called ''[[Spanglish]].''<ref name=\"Leymarie, pp. 268-269\"/>\n\n==Instrumentation==\n===Son Conjunto===\n[[File:Bongos Meinl HB100-NT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bongos.]]\n\nSalsa ensembles are typically based on one of two different Cuban instrument formats, either the horn-based son conjunto or the string-based charanga. In the 30's, [[Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez]] added a second, and then, third trumpet{{snd}}the birth of the Latin horn section. He made the bold move of adding the conga drum, the quintessential Afro-Cuban instrument. Some bands are expanded to the size of a mambo big band, but they can be thought of as an enlarged conjunto. The traditional conjunto format consists of congas, bongos, bass, piano, [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]], a horn section, and the smaller hand-held percussion instruments: claves, gu\u00edro, or maracas, played by the singers. The Cuban horn section traditionally consists of trumpets, but trombones are frequently used in salsa. The section can also use a combination of different horns. Most salsa bands are based on the conjunto model, but the tres is almost never used.\n\n===String charanga===\nThe traditional charanga format consists of congas, [[timbales]], bass, piano, flute, and a string section of violins, viola, and cello. The [[clave (rhythm)|claves]] and [[g\u00fciro]] are played by the singers. Bongos are not typically used in charanga bands. [[T\u00edpica 73]] and Orquesta Broadway were two popular New York salsa bands in the charanga format.\n\n===Percussion===\nNew York based Machito's [[Afro-Cubans]] was the first band to make the triumvirate of congas, bongo, and timbales the standard battery of percussion in Cuban-based dance music.<ref>Bobby Sanabria 2008 ''Latinjazz''.</ref> The three drums are used together in most salsa bands and function in ways similar to a traditional folkloric drum ensemble. The timbales play the bell pattern, the congas play the supportive drum part, and the bongos improvise, simulating a lead drum. The improvised variations of the bongos are executed within the context of a repetitive marcha, known as the ''martillo'' ('hammer'), and do not constitute a solo. The bongos play primarily during the verses and the piano solos. When the song transitions into the montuno section, the bongo player picks up a large hand held cowbell called the bongo bell. Often the ''bongocero'' plays the bell more during a piece, than the actual bongos. The interlocking counterpoint of the timbale bell and bongo bell provides a propelling force during the montuno. The maracas and gu\u00edro sound a steady flow of regular pulses (subdivisions) and are ordinarily clave-neutral.\n\n==Music structure==\n===Verse and chorus sections===\nMost salsa compositions follow the basic son montuno model of a verse section, followed by a [[coro-preg\u00f3n]] (call-and-response) chorus section known as the [[montuno]]. The verse section can be short, or expanded to feature the lead vocalist and/or carefully crafted melodies with clever rhythmic devices. Once the montuno section begins, it usually continues until the end of the song. The tempo may gradually increase during the montuno in order to build excitement. The montuno section can be divided into various sub-sections sometimes referred to as ''mambo'', ''diablo'', ''mo\u00f1a'', and ''especial''.<ref>Bobby Sanabria 1998 ''Latinjazz''.</ref>\n\n===Clave===\n[[File:Claves.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pair of claves.]]\n\nThe most fundamental rhythmic element in salsa music is a pattern and concept known as [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]. Clave is a Spanish word meaning '[[code]],' 'key,' as in key to a mystery or puzzle, or '[[keystone (architecture)|keystone]],' the wedge-shaped stone in the center of an arch that ties the other stones together.<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 85.</ref> Clave is also the name of the patterns played on [[claves]]; two hardwood sticks used in [[Afro-Cuban music]] ensembles. The five-[[drum stroke|stroke]] clave represents the structural core of many Afro-Cuban rhythms, both popular and folkloric.<ref>Agawu: \"[[Gerhard Kubik]] claims that a time-line pattern 'represents' the structural core of a musical piece, something like a condensed and extremely concentrated expression of the motional possibilities open to the participants (musicians and dancers)\" 2006 p. 1.</ref> Just as a keystone holds an arch in place, the clave pattern holds the rhythm together. The clave patterns originated in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]], where they serve the same function as they do in salsa.<ref>Jones refers to both \"clave\" patterns, and the seven-stroke \"{{music|time|6|8}} bell\" as the ''standard pattern'', claiming all three to be \"basically one and the same pattern.\" 1959 p. 211-212.</ref>\n\nThe two most common five-stroke African [[bell pattern|bell parts]], which are also the two main clave patterns used in Afro-Cuban music, are known to salsa musicians as ''son clave'' and ''rumba clave''.<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa: \"[C.K.] Ladzekpo cites several genres of music in Ghana alone that use both the triple and duple-pulse versions of 'son clave': the Ewe's fofui and alfi and the Ashanti's sekwi and akom. The Ga's kinka, oge and kpanlogo use duple-pulse 'son clave.'\" 2010 p. 247</ref><ref>Harington (1995 p. 63) identifies the duple-pulse form of \"rumba clave\" as a bell pattern used by the Yoruba and Ibo of Nigeria.</ref><ref>Ignacio Berroa: \"There are just two claves\u2014son clave and rumba clave.\" ''Mastering the Art Afro-Cuban Drumming'' (1996: Warner Brothers VHS).</ref><ref>Bobby Sanabria: \"''Son montuno clave'' [is] the rhythm most used in Afro-Cuban dance music, which is better known as 'salsa' Most Latin musicians call it ''son clave'' for short\" 1986: p. 76.</ref><ref>The Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n de la M\u00fasica Cubana (CIDMUC) refers to son clave as ''la clave de La Habana'' ('Havana clave') and attributes the pattern to Havana-style rumba. In the first half of the twentieth century, what we now call son clave was the clave pattern used in Havana-style yamb\u00fa and guaguanc\u00f3. It is generally agreed that the son adopted clave from rumba when the son migrated to Havana from the eastern end of the island at the turn of the twentieth century. CIDMUC refers to rumba clave as ''guaguanc\u00f3 clave''. 1997 p. 63.</ref>  Son and rumba clave can be played in either a [[Meter (music)#Types|triple-pulse]] ({{music|time|12|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}}) or [[Meter (music)#Types|duple-pulse]] ({{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|2|2}}) structure.<ref>Kevin Moore: \"In reality, as Pe\u00f1alosa explains in great detail in ''The Clave Matrix'', there's really only son and rumba clave, each of which can be played with a pure triple pulse structure feel, a pure duple pulse structure feel or somewhere in\u2010between. Needless to say, the terms ''son'' and ''rumba'' came much later.\" 2010. ''Beyond Salsa Piano v. 3'' p. 72.</ref> Salsa uses duple-pulse son clave almost exclusively.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 52.</ref><ref>In his chapter \"La Clave\" (pp. 13-32), Gerard only address duple-pulse son clave.</ref>\n\nThe contemporary Cuban practice is to write clave in a single measure of {{music|time|4|4}}.<ref>Moore 2010 p. 65.</ref> Clave is written in this way in the following example in order to illustrate the underlying metric structure of four main beats, which is fundamental to the dynamism of the pattern.<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p.5</ref>\n\n[[File:Son and rumba clave.png|thumb|center|380px|Son and rumba clave in simple meter (duple-pulse) and compound meter (triple-pulse) variants. {{audio|Son Clave Pattern duple.mid|Play duple son}}, {{audio|Son Clave Pattern triple.mid|Play triple son}}, {{audio|Rumba Clave Pattern duple.mid|Play duple rumba}}, {{audio|Rumba Clave Pattern triple.mid|Play triple rumba}}]]\n\nConcerning the role of clave in salsa music, Charley Gerard states: \"The clave feeling is in the music whether or not the claves are actually being played.\"<ref>Gerard 1989 p. 14.</ref> Every ostinato part which spans a cycle of four main beats, has a specific alignment with clave, and expresses the rhythmic qualities of clave either explicitly or implicitly. Every salsa musician must know how their particular part fits with clave, and with the other parts of the ensemble.\n\nThe basic conga ''[[tumbao]]'', or ''marcha'' sounds slaps (triangle noteheads) and open tones (regular noteheads) on the \"and\" offbeats.<ref>Sometimes clave is written in two measures of {{music|time|4|4}} and the open tone of the conga drum are referred to as the last beat of the measure (see Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 63)</ref> The single tone coinciding with the third stroke of clave is known as ''ponche'', an important syncopated accent.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 257.</ref> The specific alignment between clave and the conga is critical.\n\n[[File:Conga tumbao.jpg|thumb|center|380px|Top: clave. Bottom: basic conga tumbao on one drum. S: slap, O: open tone, h: palm heel, t: finger tips.]]\n\nThe concept of clave as a form of music theory with its accompanying terminology, was fully developed during the big band era of the 1940s, when dance bands in Havana and New York City were enlarged.<ref>Bobby Sanabria: \"The concept of utilizing 3-2 and 2-3 as a terminology developed in New York City. I have done research on this with many of the legendary figures in this tradition, most notably Mario Bauz\u00e1, who I played with for eight years.\" Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 248.</ref>  By the time salsa emerged in the 1970s, there was already a second generation of clave savvy composers and arrangers working in New York. John Santos stresses the importance of this skill:\n\n<blockquote>One of the most difficult applications of the clave is in the realm of composition and arrangement of Cuban and Cuban-based dance music. Regardless of the instrumentation, the music for all of the instruments of the ensemble must be written with a very keen and conscious rhythmic relationship to the clave ... Any 'breaks' and/or 'stops' in the arrangements must also be 'in clave'. If these procedures are not properly taken into consideration, then the music is 'out of clave' which, if not done intentionally, is considered an error. When the rhythm and music are 'in clave,' a great natural 'swing' is produced, regardless of the tempo. All musicians who write and/or interpret Cuban-based music must be 'clave conscious,' not just the percussionists.<ref>Santos 1986 p. 32.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSalsa is a potent expression of clave, and clave became a rhythmic symbol of the musical movement, as its popularity spread. Clave awareness within the salsa community has served as a cultural \"boundary marker\", creating an insider/outsider dichotomy, between Cuban and non-Cuban, and between Latino and non-Latino. At the same time though, clave serves its ancient function of providing a means of profound inclusion. As Washburne observes:\n\n<blockquote>Clapping clave at a concert in sync with the performing musicians provides for a group participation in music-making even for a novice. However, the messages transmitted can be, and often are, imbued with more meaning than simply, 'Let's all participate!' A newcomer to salsa, whether performer, dancer, listener, or consumer, must acquire some level of clave competence before engaging in these 'clave dialogues' in a deeper, more significant way.<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 195.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore salsa pianist Eddie Palmieri takes his first solo at a live concert, he will often stand up, and start clapping clave. Once the audience is clapping clave along with him, Palmieri will sit back down at the piano and proceed to take his solo. Palmieri's solos tend to be rhythmically complex, with avant-garde elements such as harmonic dissonance. By clapping clave along with Palmieri's solo, the audience is able to both \"de-code\" its rather esoteric musical \"message\", and participate in its creation at a fundamental level.\n\nClave is the basic [[period (music)|period]], composed of two rhythmically opposed [[cell (music)|cells]], one antecedent and the other consequent. Clave was initially written in two measures of {{music|time|2|4}} (below).<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1999: p. 6.</ref> When clave is written in two measures, each cell or clave half is represented within a single measure. The antecedent half has three strokes and is referred to as the ''three-side'' of clave in the parlance of salsa. In Cuban popular music, the first three strokes of son clave are also known collectively as [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]], a Spanish word meaning 'triplet' (three equal beats in the same time as two main beats).<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 38.</ref> However, in the Cuban vernacular, the term refers to the figure shown below in the first measure.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 51.</ref> The consequent half (second measure) of clave has two strokes and is called the ''two-side'' by salsa musicians.\n\n[[File:Son clave 3 side and 2 side-B.png|thumb|center|420px|Clave has a binary structure.]]\n\nThe first measure of clave is considered \"strong\", contradicting the meter with three [[cross beat]]s and generating a sense of forward momentum. The second measure is considered \"weak\". Clave resolves in the second measure when the last stroke coincides with the last main beat of the cycle.<ref>Emilio Grenet: \"[The] melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two measures, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak.\" 1939 p. XV.</ref> John Amria describes the rhythmic sequence of clave:\n\n<blockquote>[With] clave ... the two measures are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites like positive and negative, expansive and contractive or the poles of a magnet. As the pattern is repeated, an alternation from one polarity to the other takes place creating pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to be suddenly reversed, the rhythm would be destroyed as in a reversing of one magnet within a series ... the patterns are held in place according to both the internal relationships between the drums and their relationship with clave ... Should the [music] fall out of clave the internal momentum of the rhythm will be dissipated and perhaps even broken.<ref>Amira 1992 pp. 23-24.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Percussion and clave alignment===\nSince a chord progression can begin on either side of clave, percussionists have to be able to initiate their parts in either half (a single measure in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|2|4}}). The following examples show clave with the bongo bell and timbale bell parts in both a 3-2 and a 2-3 sequence. The timbale bell comes from a stick pattern (c\u00e1scara) used in the Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythm [[guaguanc\u00f3]].\n[[File:3-2clave and bells cut-time.tif|thumb|center|350px|Timbale bell and bongo bell (bottom) in 3-2 clave.]]\n[[File:2-3clave and bells cut-time.tif|thumb|center|350px|Timbale bell and bongo bell (bottom) in 2-3 clave.]]\n\nThe following example shows the most common conga (two drums), timbale bell, and bongo bell pattern combination used in salsa music.<ref>According to [[Changuito]], this timbale bell pattern was created by the percussionist Agapito of [[Orquesta Arag\u00f3n]]. ''Evolution of the Tumbadoras''. Changuito. Alfred Publishing Co (1996: VHS).</ref>\n[[File:Congas and bells in correct 2-3 alignment.tif|thumb|center|330px|From top: 2-3 clave, timbale bell, bongo bell, two congas.]]\nAccording to [[Bobby Sanabria]], the 3-2, 2-3 concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauz\u00e1]], when he was music director of Machito's Afro-Cubans.<ref>Bobby Sanabria quoted by Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 248</ref> The 3-2, 2-3 concept is a basic tenet of salsa, but it is not widely used in Cuba.<ref>Mongo Santamaria: \"Don't tell me about 3-2 or 2-3! In Cuba we just play. We feel it, we don't talk about such things\"\u2014quoted by Washburne 2008 p. 190.</ref><ref>The contemporary Cuban bassist, composer and arranger Alain P\u00e9rez flatly states: \"In Cuba we do not use that 2-3, 3-2 formula ... 2-3, 3-2 [is] not used in Cuba. That is how people learn Cuban music outside Cuba\"\u2014Timba.com 2002.http://www.timba.com/artist_pages/alain-p-rez-interview-part-2?lang=en-US</ref>\n\n===Guajeo===\nA [[guajeo]] is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. A piano guajeo may be played during the verse section of a song, but it is at the center of the montuno section. That is why some salsa musicians refer to piano guajeos as ''montunos''. Piano guajeos are one of the most recognizable elements in salsa music. As [[Sonny Bravo]] explains: \"In salsa, the piano is more of a percussion instrument than a melodic one, especially in ensemble playing. When you're backing a soloist, you play a riff over and over again. This is what we call ''guajeo''. The pianist uses this guajeo to provide the rhythm section with its drive.\"<ref>Boggs, Vernon W., ed. 1991 p. 318. Sonny Bravo quote in \"Secrets of Salsa Rhythm.\"</ref>\n\nClave and guajeos are commonly written in two measures of [[cut time]] ({{music|time|2|2}}) in salsa charts. This is most likely an influence of jazz conventions.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1999 p. 6.</ref><ref>While most salsa charts are written in cut-time, the common-time ({{music|time|4|4}}) time signature is often used. In other words, the time signature that is used does not literally reflect actual metric structure. This has led to the practice of counting eight beats (quarter-notes) per clave, while tapping one's foot four times (half-notes) per clave (see: Maule\u00f3n 1993: 47-48, and Pe\u00f1alosa 2010: 218-219).</ref>\n\nMost guajeos have a binary structure that expresses clave. Kevin Moore states: \"There are two common ways that the three-side is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Pe\u00f1alosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Moore 2011 p. 32. ''Understanding Clave''.</ref> The following guajeo example is based on a clave motif. The three-side (first measure) consists of the tresillo variant known as [[cinquillo]].\n\n[[File:3-2 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Piano guajeo: clave motif ({{audio|3-2 guajeo.mid|Play}})]]\n\nA chord progression can begin on either side of clave. In salsa \"one\" can be on either side of clave, because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression is the primary referent.<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 136.</ref> When a chord progression begins on the two-side of clave, the music is said to be in ''two-three clave''. The following guajeo is based on the clave motif in a two-three sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.\n\n[[File:2-3 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|500px|2-3 piano guajeo: clave motif ({{audio|2-3 guajeo.mid|Play}})]]\n\nMoore: \"By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Pe\u00f1alosa calls the 'offbeat/onbeat motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> With this type of guajeo motif, the three-side of clave is expressed with all offbeats. The following I IV V IV progression is in a three-two clave sequence. It begins with an offbeat pick-up on the pulse immediately before beat 1. With some guajeos, offbeats at the end of the two-side, or onbeats at the end of the three-side serve as pick-ups leading into the next measure (when clave is written in two measures).\n\n[[File:B guajeo.tif|thumb|center|450px|3-2 guajeo: offbeat/onbeat motif ({{audio|B guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]\n\nThis guajeo is in two-three clave because it begins on the downbeat, emphasizing the onbeat quality of the two-side. The figure has the same exact harmonic sequence as the previous example, but rhythmically, the attack-point sequence of the two measures is reversed. Most salsa is in two-three clave, and most salsa piano guajeos are based on the two-three onbeat/offbeat motif.\n\n[[File:Two three guajeo.tif|thumb|center|450px|2-3 guajeo: onbeat/offbeat motif ({{audio|Two three guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]\n\nWhen salsa uses non-Cuban rhythms, such as a Puerto Rican plena, guajeos are essential to tie that genre in with the salsa format. The expression of the 2-3 onbeat/offbeat motif is more abstract in this guajeo than in others previous mentioned.<ref>After Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 213.</ref> The offbeat and onbeat pick ups begin at their extreme limit in the preceding measures. The third measure outlines a G7 chord. The other measures outline C.\n[[File:Plena guajeo.tif|thumb|center|370px|2-3 plena guajeo: onbeat/offbeat motif.]]\n\n===Bass tumbao===\nMost salsa bass [[tumbao]]s are based on the tresillo pattern. Often the last note of the measure (ponche) is held over the downbeat of the next measure. In this way, only the two offbeats of tresillo are sounded. This tumbao is clave-neutral.\n[[File:Tresillo based tumbaos.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Clave-neutral tresillo-based tumbao.]]\n\nSome salsa tumbaos that have a specific alignment with clave. The following 2-3 bass line coincides with three of the clave's five strokes.\n\n===Mo\u00f1as===\nA mo\u00f1a is a horn guajeo, which can be written or improvised.<ref>Maule\u00f3n, Rebeca (1993: 256). ''Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble''. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. {{ISBN|0-9614701-9-4}}.</ref> What's known as the Cuban ''t\u00edpico style'' of soloing on trombone draws upon the technique of stringing together mo\u00f1a variations. The following example shows five different variants of a 2-3 trombone mo\u00f1a improvised by Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez  on \"Bilongo\" (c. 1969), performed by Eddie Palmieri.\n\nMo\u00f1a 1 sounds every stroke of 2-3 clave except the first stroke of the three-side. Melodic variety is created by transposing the module in accordance to the harmonic sequence, as Rick Davies observes in his detailed analysis of the first mo\u00f1a:\n\n<blockquote>The mo\u00f1a consists of a two-measure module and its repetition, which is altered to reflect the montuno chord progression. The module begins with four ascending eighth-notes starting on the second [quarter-note of the measure]. This configuration emphasizes the ... two-side of the clave. In both of the modules, these four notes move from G3 to Eb4. Although the first, third, and fourth notes (G3, C4, and Eb4) are identical in both modules, the second note reflects the change in harmony. In the first module, this note is the Bb3 third of the tonic harmony; in the module repetition, the A3 is the fifth of the dominant. Of the final five notes in the module, the first four are [offbeats]; the final D4 is on the [last quarter-note] in the second measure of the module. Along with the final D4, the initial D4 on the [last offbeat] in the first measure of the module and the Eb4 on the [offbeat] immediately preceding the final note of the module are identical in both modules. The [offbeats] in the second-module measure reflect the harmonic changes. The first version of the module is over the dominant chord and contains the pitches A3 (the fifth) and C4 (the seventh). A Bb3 is sounded twice on the two [offbeats] in the module's repetition and represents the third G minor tonic chord.<ref>Davies, Rick (2003: 149). ''Trompeta; Chappott\u00edn, Chocolate, and the Afro-Cuban Trumpet Styl''e. {{ISBN|0-8108-4680-2}}.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nA section of layered, contrapuntal horn guajeos is also referred to sometimes as a mo\u00f1a. Mo\u00f1as differ from typical rhythm section guajeos in that they often will rest for a beat or two within their cycle. Those beats within a measure not sounded by the mo\u00f1a are often \"filled\" by a chorus, or counter mo\u00f1a. The trumpet and trombone mo\u00f1as shown below (\"Bilongo\") can be repeated verbatim, or altered. Improvisation is within a framework of repetition and the melodic contour of the mo\u00f1as. In this way, multiple instrumentalists can improvise simultaneously while reinforcing the rhythmic/melodic momentum of the rhythm section.<ref>Davies, Rick (2003: 149).

This is a classic example of how mo\u00f1as are layered. The trombone Mo\u00f1a consists of two parts, a call-and-response structure. The trumpet mo\u00f1a begins on the last note of first half of the trombone mo\u00f1a. The second half of the trombone mo\u00f1a begins on the pulse (subdivision) immediately following the last note of the trumpet mo\u00f1a.\n\n[[File:Guatacando monas.tif|thumb|center|450px|2-3 trumpet and trombone mo\u00f1as, \"Guatacando\" (1968). 1. trumpets; 2. trombones.]]\n\n==History==\n===Pre-salsa: Cuban dance music in New York City 1940s-1970s===\n[[File:The Palladium Ballroom.gif|thumb|left|280px|The Palladium Ballroom, home of the mambo, c. 1950s.]]\nSalsa emerged from New York City in the mid-1970s, then spread throughout Latin America and the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=Manuel46/> However, the music had already been going strong in the city for several decades prior to the use of the label ''salsa''. New York had been a center of Cuban-style dance music since the 1940s, when landmark innovations by Machito's Afro-Cubans helped usher in the mambo era. Tito Puente worked for a time in the Afro-Cubans before starting up his own successful band. By the early 1950s, there were three very popular mambo big bands in New York: Machito and his Afro-Cubans, Tito Puente, and [[Tito Rodr\u00edguez]]. There were many other working bands as well. The [[Palladium Ballroom]] was the epicenter of mambo in New York. At the height of its popularity, the Palladium attracted [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stars, especially on Wednesday nights, when a free dance lesson was offered. The mambo and its \"temple\", the Palladium, were racially and ethnically integrated phenomena.\n\nThe next Cuban \"dance craze\" to hit the United States was the chachach\u00e1. The chachach\u00e1 originated in the Cuban charanga bands, but was adopted by the horn-based groups in New York. By the early 1960s, there were several charanga bands in New York, led by future salsa icons Johnny Pacheco, Charlie Palmieri, and Ray Barretto. Mongo Santamar\u00eda also had a charanga  during this period. The [[pachanga]] was popularized by Orquesta Sublime and other Cuban charangas. The pachanga was the last Cuban popular dance to take ahold in New York's Latin community. The U.S. embargo against Cuba (1962) halted the two-way flow of music and musicians between Cuba and the United States.\n\nThe first post-Revolution Cuban dance music genre was the short-lived, but highly influential [[mozambique (music)|mozambique]] (1963).{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Neither the dance, nor the music caught on outside of Cuba. In spite of this, members of Eddie Palmieri's ''Conjunto la Perfecta'' did hear this new music over shortwave radio, inspiring them to create a similar rhythm which they also called mozambique. Although the two rhythms share no parts in common, the band received death threats because some right wing Cuban exiles thought Palmieri's band was playing contemporary Cuban music.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nThere was one final distinct Latin music era in New York before salsa emerged, and it was an original, home-grown hybrid: the Latin [[boogaloo]] (or boogal\u00fa). By the mid-1960s, a hybrid Nuyorican cultural identity emerged, primarily Puerto Rican but influenced by many Latin cultures as well as the close contact with African Americans.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 489.</ref> The boogaloo was a true Nuyorican music, a bi-lingual mix of R&B and Cuban rhythms. It had two Top 20 hits in 1963: Mongo Santamar\u00eda's performance of the [[Herbie Hancock]] piece \"[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]\" and [[Ray Barretto]]'s \"El Watusi\", which in a sense, established the basic boogaloo formula. The term ''boogaloo'' was probably coined in about 1966 by [[Richie Ray]] and [[Bobby Cruz]]. The biggest boogaloo hit of the 60s was \"Bang Bang\" by the [[Joe Cuba]] Sextet, which achieved unprecedented success for [[Latin music in the United States]] in 1966 when it sold over one million copies. \"El Pito\" was another hit by this popular combo. Hits by other groups included [[Johnny Colon|Johnny Col\u00f3n]]'s \"Boogaloo Blues\", Pete Rodr\u00edguez's \"I Like It like That\", and Hector Rivera's \"At the Party\". [[Joe Bataan]] and the [[Lebron Brothers]] are two other important boogaloo bands.\n\nIn 1966, the same year as Joe Cuba's pop success, the Palladium closed because it lost its liquor license.<ref name=\"Steward\">Steward, Sue 1999.

Inspired by these movements, Latinos in New York formed the [[Young Lords]], rejected assimilation and \"made the barrio a cauldron of militant assertiveness and artistic creativity\".<ref>Manuel 2006, p. 90</ref> The musical aspect of this social change was based on the Cuban son, which had long been the favored musical form for urbanites in both Puerto Rico  and New York.<ref>Manuel 1995, p. 73</ref> The Manhattan-based recording company Fania Records introduced many of the first-generation salsa singers and musicians to the world. Founded by Dominican flautist and band-leader Johnny Pacheco and impresario [[Jerry Masucci]], Fania was launched with Willie Col\u00f3n and [[H\u00e9ctor Lavoe]]'s ''El Malo'' in 1967. This was followed by a series of updated son montuno and [[plena]] tunes that evolved into modern salsa by 1973. Pacheco put together a team that included percussionist [[Louie Ramirez]], bassist [[Bobby Valent\u00edn]] and arranger [[Larry Harlow (salsa)|Larry Harlow]]. The Fania team released a string of successful singles, mostly ''son'' and ''plena'', performing live after forming the [[Fania All-Stars]]\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:RogerDawson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Roger Dawson]] hosted a very popular New York radio show featuring salsa.]]\nIn 1971 the Fania All-Stars sold out [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].<ref name=\"steward488_489\">Steward 2000, pp. 488\u2013489</ref> By the early 1970s, the music's center moved to Manhattan and the [[Cheetah (nightclub)|Cheetah]], where promoter [[Ralph Mercado]] introduced many future Puerto Rican salsa stars to an ever-growing and diverse crowd of Latino audiences.  The 1970s also brought new semi-known Salsa Bands from New York City, Bands like Angel Canales, Andy Harlow (Larry Harlow's brother), [[Chino Rodriguez]] y su Consagracion ([[Chino Rodriguez]] was one of the first Chinese Puerto Rican artist that cued the eye of Fania Record's owner Jerry Masucci and later became the Booking Agent for many of the Fania Artists.), Wayne Gorbea, Ernie Agusto y la Conspiracion, Orchestra Ray Jay, Orchestra Fuego, and Orchestra Cimarron, amongst other bands that were performing in the Salsa market in the East Coast of the USA. \nIn 1975 New York, DJ and conga drummer, [[Roger Dawson]] created the \"Sunday Salsa Show\" over WRVR FM which became one of the highest-rated radio shows in the New York market with a reported audience of over a quarter of a million listeners every Sunday (per Arbitron Radio Ratings). Ironically, although New York's Hispanic population at that time was over two million, there had been no commercial Hispanic FM. Given his jazz and salsa conga playing experience and knowledge (working as a sideman with such bands as salsa's Frankie Dante's Orquesta Flamboyan and jazz saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]]), Dawson also created the long-running \"Salsa Meets Jazz\" weekly concert series at the [[Village Gate]] jazz club where jazz musicians would sit in with an established salsa band, for example [[Dexter Gordon]] jamming with the Machito band. Dawson helped to broaden New York's salsa audience and introduced new artists such as the bi-lingual Angel Canales who were not given play on the Hispanic AM stations of that time. His show won several awards from the readers of Latin New York magazine, Izzy Sanabria's ''Salsa Magazine'' at that time and ran until late 1980 when Viacom changed the format of WRVR to [[country music]].<ref>Manuel 1990, p. 48</ref>\n\nFrom New York, salsa quickly expanded to Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries. The number of salsa bands, both in New York and elsewhere, increased dramatically, as did salsa-oriented radio stations and record labels. \n[[File:Cuatro de puerto rico.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cuatro (Puerto Rico)|Puerto Rican ''cuatro'']] with ten strings]]\nThe 1970s saw a number of musical innovations among salsa musicians. Willie Col\u00f3n introduced the ''[[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]'', a rural Puerto Rican [[plucked string instrument]], as well as some songs with jazz, rock, and [[music of Panama|Panamanian]] and [[music of Brazil|Brazilian music]] influences.<ref>Leymarie 2003, pp. 272\u2013273, Leymarie cites the 1972 double Christmas album ''Asalto navide\u00f1o'' as the \"first time that (the ''cuatro'') and Puerto Rico's country music appeared in salsa.\"</ref>\n\n[[Celia Cruz]], who had a successful career in Cuba, was able to transition well to salsa in the United States. She became known as the Queen of Salsa. Larry Harlow, a bandleader, and arranger for Fania Records, modernized salsa by adding an [[electric piano]]. Harlow also stretched out from the typical salsa formula with his ambitious opera ''Hommy'' (1973), inspired by the Who's ''Tommy'', and integral to Celia Cruz's comeback from early retirement. In 1979 Harlow released his critically acclaimed ''La Raza Latina, a Salsa Suite''.\n\nThe slick, highly produced Fania sound was too predictably formulaic for some tastes. There was a niche for more adventurous Puerto Rican bands, such as Eddie Palmieri, and [[Manny Oquendo]]'s Libre. The two bands were the main proponents of NY-style Mozambique, drew inspiration from the classic Cuban composers, and Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythms, while pushing the limits of salsa, and incorporating jazz elements. They also featured some of the best trombone soloists in the business, several of whom were \"Anglo\" jazz musicians who had mastered the t\u00edpico style. Most famous of these was [[Barry Rogers]]. The Gonzalez brothers, Jerry and Andy, played congas and bass respectively, in Libre. Prior to the founding of Libre, they had played in one of Palmieri's most experimental salsa bands. Andy Gonzalez recounts: \"We were into improvising ... doing that thing [[Miles Davis]] was doing\u2014playing themes and just improvising on the themes of songs, and we never stopped playing through the whole set.\"<ref>Boggs 1992 p. 290. Andy Gonzalez quote.</ref> While in Palmieri's band (1974-1976), the Gonzalez brothers started showing up in the DownBeat Reader's Poll. Palmieri and Libre caught the attention of jazz critics and reached listening to audiences who were not necessarily a part of the salsa culture.\n\nBy the end of the decade, Fania Records' longtime leadership of salsa was weakened by the arrival of the labels [[Rodven Records|TH-Rodven]] and [[RMM Records & Video|RMM]].\n\n===Divergence of salsa and Cuban popular music===\nIronically, Cuban popular music during the 1970s incorporated North American jazz, rock, and funk in much more significant ways than did salsa. Whereas salsa occasionally superimposes elements of another genre, or incorporates a non-salsa style in the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] of a song, Cuban popular music since the 1970s has fully integrated North American jazz and funk to the point of true hybrid. It began with [[Juan Formell]], the former director for Orquesta Rev\u00e9 (1968), and the founder and current director of [[Los Van Van]]. Formell fused American pop with clave-based Cuban elements. Moore states: \"The harmonies, never before heard in Cuban music, were clearly borrowed from North American pop [and] shattered the formulaic limitations on harmony to which Cuban popular music had faithfully adhered for so long.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Moore, Kevin|date=2011|title=\"The Roots of Timba, Part II; Juan Formell y Los Van Van.\"|website=Timba.com|url=http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/juan-formell-y-los-van-van|access-date=2012-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408133626/http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/juan-formell-y-los-van-van|archive-date=2011-04-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Cuban super group [[Irakere]] fused [[bebop]] and [[funk]] with [[bat\u00e1 drum]]s and other Afro-Cuban folkloric elements. The 1970s was the [[songo music|songo]] era in Cuba, with groups like Los Van Van and Orquesta Ritmo Oriental playing a highly syncopated, rumba-influenced form of charanga.\n\nFor the most part, salsa music was not influenced by developments in Cuban popular music during the 1970s. One notable exception was Sonny Bravo of T\u00edpica '73, who arranged songs by contemporary Cuban charangas. In 1979 T\u00edpica '73 travelled to Havana to record ''T\u00edpica '73 en Cuba'', a collaboration between the band and Cuban musicians.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Oscar D Leon 2011.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Oscar D'Leon (2011).]]\nIn 1980 the [[Mariel boatlift]] brought thousands of Cuban refugees to the United States. Many of these refugees were musicians, who were astonished to hear what sounded to them like Cuban music from the 1950s. It was as if the 60s never happened. Cuban conguero Daniel Ponce summarized this sentiment: \"When the Cubans arrived in New York, they all said 'Yuk! This is old music.' The music and the feelings and arrangements [haven't] changed.\"<ref>Gerard 1989 p. 6. Daniel Ponce quote</ref> In fundamental ways, salsa is the preservation of the late 1950s Cuban sound.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nThe influx of Cuban musicians had more of an impact on jazz than salsa. After the boatlift though, there was obviously more awareness of the modern Cuban styles. Tito Puente recorded the Irakere composition \"Bacalao con pan\" (1980), and Rub\u00e9n Blades covered Los Van Van's \"Muevete\" (1985). The bands Batacumbele and Zaperoko of Puerto Rico fully embraced songo. Led by Angel \"Cachete\" Maldonado and featuring a young [[Giovanni Hidalgo]], Batacumbele interpreted songo in a horn-based format, with a strong jazz influence.\n\nBy the early 1980s a generation of New York City musicians had come of age playing both [[salsa (music)|salsa]] dance music and jazz. The time had come for a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers of Conjunto Libre (as the band was originally called). [[Jerry Gonzalez]] founded the jazz group the Fort Apache Band, which included his brother Andy and established a new standard for Latin jazz. During this same period, Tito Puente changed to performing and recording primarily Latin jazz for the remainder of his career. By 1989 Eddie Palmieri had also switched to playing mostly Latin jazz.\n\nThe 1980s saw salsa expand to Nicaragua, Argentina, Peru, Europe and Japan, and diversify into new stylistic interpretations. [[Oscar D'Le\u00f3n]] from Venezuela is a huge salsa star. In Colombia, a new generation of musicians began to combine salsa with elements of ''[[cumbia]]'' and ''[[vallenato]]''; this fusion tradition can be traced back to the 1960s work of Peregoyo y su Combo Vacana. However, it was [[Joe Arroyo]] and [[La Verdad (band)|La Verdad]], his band, that popularized Colombian salsa beginning in the 1980s.<ref>Steward 2000, pp. 379, 502</ref> The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of Colombian salsa in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger [[Fruko y sus Tesos]] (Fruko and his band Los Tesos).<ref>Steward 2000, pp. 493\u2013497</ref> [[Grupo Niche]] is based in [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], Colombia, and enjoys great popularity throughout Latin America. One of their biggest hits, \"Cali Pachanguero\" (1984), was seemingly arranged oblivious to clave.<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 182-183.</ref> As salsa grew and flourished in other countries, removed by both time and space from the New York epicenter, it adopted local sensibilities and drifted away from its Afro-Cuban moorings.\n\n{{wide image|Gatonegro Cali Noche desde Cristo Rey.jpg|800px|<center> A panoramic showing of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], main city in western Colombia, where salsa is very popular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocuadrado.com/decoracion/content/cali-la-capital-mundial-de-la-salsa |title=Metrocuadrado.com |publisher=Metrocuadrado.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salsa.ch/news_view.php?idnews=178 |title=Cali: Capital Mundial de la Salsa |publisher=salsa.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbnoticias.com/vernoticia.asp?WPLACA=14272 |title=Cali ratific\u00f3 ser la capital mundial de la salsa |language=es|publisher=HSB Noticias |date=2017-05-13 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref></center>\n}}\n\nThe 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth Puerto Rican [[salsa romantica]], with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, [[salsa erotica]]. Salsa romantica can be traced back to ''Noches Calientes'', a 1984 album by singer [[Jos\u00e9 Alberto]] with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audiences with a new style characterized by romantic lyrics, an emphasis on the melody over rhythm, and use of percussion breaks and chord changes.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 493; The crux of Steward's claims are confirmed by Leymarie 2003, p. 287, who nevertheless describes ''Noches Calientes'' as Ramirez's, with Ray de la Paz on vocals, without mentioning Alberto.</ref> Some viewed salsa romantica as a rhythmically watered-down version of the genre. Critics of ''salsa rom\u00e1ntica'', especially in the late 80s and early 90s, called it a commercialized, diluted form of Latin pop, in which formulaic, sentimental love ballads were simply put to Afro-Cuban rhythms\u2014leaving no room for classic salsa's brilliant musical improvisation, or for classic salsa lyrics that tell stories of daily life or provide social and political commentary. The marketing of ''salsa rom\u00e1ntica'' singers has often been based more on their youthful sex appeal than on the quality of their music. For these reasons, the form sometimes has been derided as ''salsa monga'' (limp or flaccid salsa), as opposed to ''salsa gorda'' or ''salsa dura'' (fat or 'hard salsa').Omar Alfanno is probably the most prolific songwriter in the salsa rom\u00e1ntica genre he was hand held into the business by Salsa Dura songwriter Johnny Ortiz. Other notable composers include Palmer Hernandez and Jorge Luis Piloto. Antonio \"Tony\" Moreno, [[Chino Rodriguez]], Sergio George and Julio \"Gunda\" Merced are some of the most notable producers in the salsa rom\u00e1ntica genre. Salsa lost popularity among many Latino youth, who were drawn to American rock in large numbers, while the popularization of Dominican merengue further sapped the audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico.<ref>Manuel 1990, p. 49</ref>\n\nAlong with the salsa-pop fusion of salsa rom\u00e1ntica, the 1980s saw the combining elements of salsa with soul, R&B, and [[hip hop music]]. The dilution of Afro-Cuban rhythmic principles created problems for some. Washburne recounts: \"As arrangers struggled to 'fit' these music styles into a salsa format, a variety of 'clave discrepancies,' or clashes, like in 'Cali Pachanguero,' often resulted. As the salsa style became more culturally diverse, Nuyorican and Puerto Rican traditionalists often reacted by emphatically positing clave as a representative of, or essential to, Puerto Rican cultural identity.\"<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 190.</ref>\n\n===\"Salsa cubana\" and the birth of timba===\nIn the mid-1980s salsa finally caught on in Cuba. However, the development of Salsa Cubana is drastically different. Moore:\n\n<blockquote>Venezuelan salsa star Oscar D'Le\u00f3n's 1983 tour of Cuba is mentioned prominently by every Cuban I've ever interviewed on the subject. Rub\u00e9n Blades' album ''Siembra'' was heard everywhere on the island throughout the mid-80s and has been quoted extensively in the gu\u00edas and coros of everyone from Van Van's Mayito Rivera (who quotes [Blades'] 'Pl\u00e1stico' in his gu\u00edas on the 1997 classic ''Ll\u00e9vala a tu vacil\u00f3n''), to El M\u00e9dico de la Salsa (quoting another major hook from 'Pl\u00e1stico'\u2014'se ven en la cara, se ven en la cara, nunca en el coraz\u00f3n'\u2014in his final masterpiece before leaving Cuba, ''Di\u00f3s sabe'').<ref>Moore, Kevin 2011 p. 73.

Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com.{{ISBN|1460965426}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPrior to D'Le\u00f3n's performance, Cuban musicians had for the most part, rejected salsa, considering it bad imitation Cuban music. Something changed after d'Le\u00f3n's performance. By that time, Cuban popular music had moved way beyond the old Cuban templates used in salsa. Cuba's momentary \"salsa craze\" brought back some of those older templates. For example, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental started using the most common salsa timbale bell and bongo bell combination. That bell arrangement became the standard for timba, which emerged at the end of the 1980s.\n\nThe release of ''En la calle'' (1989) by [[NG La Banda]], marked the beginning of the post-songo era. This new music shared more with salsa than the Cuban music of the previous decade. Departing from the rumba-inspired percussion parts of the previous songo era, \"La expresiva\" uses typical salsa bell patterns creatively incorporated into a Cuban-style timbales/drum kit hybrid. The tumbadora ('conga') plays elaborate variations on the son montuno-based tumbao, rather than in the songo style. In contrast to salsa though, NG's bass tumbaos are busier, and rhythmically and harmonically more complex than typically heard in salsa. The breakdown sections in ''En la calle'' have more in common with both the folkloric guaguanc\u00f3 of that time, and hip-hop, than with salsa.\n\nSome Cuban musicians referred to this late-80s sound as ''salsa cubana'', a term which for the first time, included Cuban music as a part of salsa.<ref name=\"Maule\u00f3n 1999, p. 80\"/> In the mid-1990s California-based Bembe Records released CDs by several Cuban bands, as part of their ''salsa cubana series''. Those bands included Manolito y su Trabuco, Orquesta Sublime, and Irakere which was nominated for a Grammy. Other North American labels such as Qbadic and Xenophile also released CDs by contemporary Cuban bands. It would seem at last that Cuban popular music could be marketed as salsa. In 1997, the film and CD [[Buena Vista Social Club]], produced by [[Ry Cooder]], was a big hit in the United States. America \"discovered\" Cuban music once again. However, for the most part, the music of the BVSC and its spin-offs was from the pre-mambo era. They do not play salsa. One exception was the BVSC spin-off, the [[Afro-Cuban All Stars]]. When touring the United States the All Stars performed arrangements that began very much like salsa tunes, but they would also employ breakdowns about halfway through the pieces. The Buena Vista Social Club and its spin-off groups did not exist in Cuba as working bands. They were put together for touring outside of Cuba. The bands that were playing in Havana had meanwhile been steadily evolving into something quite distinctly Cuban, and less like salsa. The Cuban jazz pianist [[Gonzalo Rubalcaba]] developed a technique of pattern and harmonic displacement in the 1980s, which was adopted into [[timba]] guajeos in the 1990s. The guajeo (shown above) for Issac Delgado's \"La tem\u00e1tica\" (1997) demonstrates some of the innovations of timba piano. A series of repeated octaves invoke a characteristic metric ambiguity. Techniques like guajeo pattern displacement often make the music difficult for non-Cubans to dance to.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nThe term ''salsa cubana'' which had barely taken hold, eventually fell out of favor, and was replaced with ''[[timba]]''. Some of the other important timba bands include Az\u00facar Negra, Bamboleo, [[Manol\u00edn \"El M\u00e9dico de la salsa\"]]. [[Charanga Habanera]], Havana d'Primera, Klimax, [[Paulito FG]], Pupy y Los Que Son, Salsa Mayor, and Tiempo Libre. Cuban timba musicians and New York salsa musicians have had positive and creative exchanges over the years, but the two genres remain somewhat separated, appealing to different audiences. Nevertheless, some people today include Cuban groups in the salsa category.\n\n===African salsa===\n[[File:Orch baob 062608 001.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Orchestra Baobab]]\nCuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic.<ref>Nigerian musician Segun Bucknor: \"Latin American music and our music is virtually the same\"\u2014quoted by Collins 1992 p. 62</ref> ''The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1''. states:\n\n<blockquote>Beginning in the 1940s, Afro-Cuban [son] groups such as Septeto Habanero and Trio Matamoros gained widespread popularity in the Congo region as a result of airplay over Radio Congo Belge, a powerful radio station based in L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa DRC). A proliferation of music clubs, recording studios, and concert appearances of Cuban bands in L\u00e9opoldville spurred on the Cuban music trend during the late 1940s and 1950s.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1''. 2010 p. 407.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCongolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music ''rumba'', although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as [[soukous]].<ref>Roberts, John Storm. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''. Original Music cassette tape (1986).</ref>\n\nCuban popular music played a major role in the development of many contemporary genres of African popular music. John Storm Roberts states: \"It was the Cuban connection, but increasingly also New York salsa, that provided the major and enduring influences\u2014the ones that went deeper than earlier imitation or passing fashion. The Cuban connection began very early and was to last at least twenty years, being gradually absorbed and re-Africanized.\"<ref>Roberts 1986. 20: 50. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''.</ref> The re-working of Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns by Africans brings the rhythms full circle.\n\nThe re-working of the harmonic patterns reveals a striking difference in perception. The I IV V IV harmonic progression, so common in Cuban music, is heard in pop music all across the African continent, thanks to the influence of Cuban music. Those chords move in accordance with the basic tenets of Western music theory. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, performers of African popular music do not necessarily perceive these progressions in the same way: \"The harmonic cycle of C-F-G-F [I-IV-V-IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music.\"<ref>Kubik 1999 p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe largest wave of Cuban-based music to hit Africa was in the form of salsa. In 1974 the Fania All Stars performed in [[Zaire]] (known today as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa. This was captured on film and released as ''Live In Africa'' (''Salsa Madness'' in the UK). The Zairean appearance occurred  at a music festival held in conjunction with the [[Muhammad Ali]]/[[George Foreman]] [[Rumble in the Jungle|heavyweight title fight]]. Local genres were already well established by this time. Even so, salsa caught on in many African countries, especially in the Senegambia and Mali. Cuban music had been the favorite of Senegal's nightspot in the 1950s to 1960s.<ref>Stapleton 1990 116-117.</ref> The Senegalese band [[Orchestra Baobab]] plays in a basic salsa style with congas and timbales, but with the addition of Wolof and Mandinka instruments and lyrics.\n\nAccording to Lise Waxer, \"African salsa points not so much to a return of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of cultural appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World.\"<ref>Waxer 2002 p. 12.</ref> Since the mid-1990s African artists have also been very active through the super-group [[Africando]], where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, [[Ricardo Lemvo]], [[Ismael Lo]] and [[Salif Keita]]. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.\n\n===1990s to the present===\n[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Marc Anthony performing at the White House (2009).]]\nProducer and pianist [[Sergio George]] helped to revive salsa's commercial success in the 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like [[Tito Nieves]], [[La India]], and [[Marc Anthony]]. George also produced the Japanese salsa band [[Orquesta de la Luz]]. [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Son By Four]], [[V\u00edctor Manuelle]], and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English.<ref>Steward 2000, pp. 488\u2013499</ref> More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: \"Though clave is considered, it is not always the most important thing in my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. When I stopped trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave.\"<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 191. Sergio George quote.</ref> As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not always get a pass:\n\n<blockquote>Marc Anthony is a product of George's innovationist approach. As a novice to Latin music, he was propelled into band leader position with little knowledge of how the music was structured. One revealing moment came during a performance in 1994, just after he had launched his salsa career. During a piano solo he approached the timbales, picked up a stick, and attempted to play clave on the clave block along with the band. It became apparent that he had no idea where to place the rhythm. Shortly thereafter during a radio interview in San Juan Puerto Rico, he exclaimed that his commercial success proved that you did not need to know about clave to make it in Latin music. This comment caused an uproar both in Puerto Rico and New York. After receiving the bad press, Anthony refrained from discussing the subject in public, and he did not attempt to play clave on stage until he had received some private lessons.<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 192</ref></blockquote>\n\nSalsa remained a major part of Colombian music through the 1990s, producing popular bands like [[Sonora Carruseles]], while the singer [[Carlos Vives]] created his own style that blends salsa with [[vallenato]] and rock. Vives' popularization of [[vallenato-salsa]] led to the accordion-led vallenato style being used by mainstream pop stars such as [[Gloria Estefan]]. The city of [[Cali]], is known as Colombia's \"capital of salsa\", having produced such groups as Orquesta Guayacan, [[Grupo Niche]], songwriter [[Kike Santander]], and  Julian Collazos, the producer of the Marco Barrientos Band.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 504</ref> Cabijazz from Venezuela plays a unique blend of timba-like salsa with a strong jazz influence.\n\nThe most recent innovations in salsa genre include hybrids like [[Latin house]], salsa-merengue and [[salsaton]], alongside [[salsa gorda]].\n\n==Films==\n* 1979 - ''Salsa: Latin Music in the Cities''.

Salsa is the product of various Cuban musical genres including the Afro-Cuban [[son montuno]], [[guaracha]], [[cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha cha ch\u00e1]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], and to a certain extent [[bolero]] and the Puerto Rican [[Plena]] and [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|Bomba]]. [[Latin jazz]], which was also developed in New York City, has had a significant influence on salsa arrangers, piano [[guajeo]]s, and instrumental soloists.<ref>Gerard 1989, pp. 8\u20139. \"From jazz came a harmonic vocabulary based on extended harmonies of altered and unaltered ninths, elevenths and thirteenths, as well as quartal harmony\u2014chords built on fourths. These harmonic devices entered salsa in the piano styles of Eddie Palmieri and the Puerto Rican Papo Lucca. They would take traditional piano figures based on simple tonic-dominant harmony and elaborate them with modern harmonies. These modern harmonies are now a staple of salsa arrangers such as Marty Sheller and Oscar Hern\u00e1ndez.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://blog.pimsleur.com/2018/11/28/pimsleur-guide-to-latin-music-salsa/ |title= Origins of Salsa Music|website=Pimsleur.com}}</ref>\n\nSalsa is primarily Cuban [[son (music)|son]], itself a fusion of [[Music of Spain|Spanish]] [[canci\u00f3n]] and guitar and [[Afro-Cuban percussion]], merged with [[African-American]] music styles such as [[jazz]]. Salsa also occasionally incorporates elements of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[funk]].<ref>Morales 2003, p. 33. Morales writes that \"While many Afro-Cuban music purists continue to claim that salsa is a mere variation on Cuba's musical heritage, the hybridizing experience the music went through in New York from the 1920s on incorporated influences from many different branches of the Latin American tradition, and later from jazz, R&B, and even rock.\" Morales' claim is confirmed by Unterberger's and Steward's analysis.</ref> All of these non-Cuban elements are grafted onto the basic Cuban son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1993, p. 215. Maule\u00f3n codifies this approach with examples of bomba, plena, and merengue arrangements for salsa ensemble. When adapting these non-Cuban rhythms to salsa it is common to alter them in order to fit into the Cuban template. For example, Maule\u00f3n's merengue chart includes clave, which is essential to Cuban popular music, although it is not a component of the traditional Dominican rhythm.</ref>\n\nThe first salsa bands were predominantly [[Cuba|Cubans]] and [[Puerto Ricans]].<ref>Boggs 1992, pp. 187-193</ref><ref>Hutchinson 2004, p. 116. Hutchinson says salsa music and dance \"both originated with Cuban rhythms that were brought to New York and adopted, adapted, reformulated, and made new by the Puerto Ricans living there.\"</ref><ref>Catapano 2011. \"Although a great number of New York's stars and sidemen in the 1970s were Cuban and Puerto Rican, the basic musical elements of salsa were derived mainly from Cuba.\"</ref> The music eventually spread throughout [[Cali|Colombia]] and the rest of the Americas.<ref name=\"Manuel46\">Manuel, ''Popular Music of the Non-Western World'', p. 46</ref> Ultimately, it became a global phenomenon. Some of the founding salsa artists were [[Johnny Pacheco]] (the creator of the [[Fania All-Stars]]), [[Celia Cruz]], [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]], [[Richie Ray]], [[Bobby Cruz]], [[Ray Barretto]], [[Willie Col\u00f3n]], [[Larry Harlow (salsa)|Larry Harlow]], [[Roberto Roena]], [[Bobby Valent\u00edn]], [[Eddie Palmieri]], and [[H\u00e9ctor Lavoe]].<ref name=\"Unterberger, p. 50\">Unterberger, p. 50</ref>\n\n==Salsa as a musical term==\n''Salsa'' means '[[sauce]]' in the [[Spanish language]], and carries connotations of the spiciness common in Latin and Caribbean cuisine.<ref>Waxer 2002, p. 6</ref> In the 20th century, ''salsa'' acquired a musical meaning in both English and Spanish. In this sense ''salsa'' has been described as a word with \"vivid associations\".<ref name=Steward488>Steward 2000, p. 488. [[Celia Cruz]] said, \"salsa is Cuban music with another name. It's mambo, chachach\u00e1, rumba, son ... all the Cuban rhythms under one name.\"</ref> Cubans and Puerto Ricans in New York have used the term analogously to [[Swing (genre)|swing]] or [[soul music]]. In this usage ''salsa'' connotes a frenzied, \"hot\" and wild musical experience that draws upon or reflects elements of Latin culture, regardless of the style.<ref>Jones and Kantonen, 2000. \"The word ''salsa'' ('spicy sauce') had long been used by Cuban immigrants as something analogous to the term ''swing''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Manuel, p. 46\">Manuel 1990, [https://archive.org/details/popularmusicsofn0000manu/page/46 p. 46]. \"On one level, as Singer and Friedman note, salsa is to Latinos as 'soul' is to blacks; salsa\u2014literally, 'hot sauce'\u2014spicy, zesty, energetic, and unmistakably Latino.\"</ref>\n\nVarious music writers and historians have traced the use of ''salsa'' to different periods of the 20th century. [[Max Salazar]] traces the word back to the early 1930s, when [[Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro]] composed \"\u00c9chale salsita\", a Cuban ''[[son (music)|son]]'' protesting tasteless food.<ref>Salazar 1991; Waxer 2002, p. 6; Morales 2003, pp. 56\u201359. Morales dates the song to 1932.</ref> While Salazar describes this song as the origin of ''salsa'' meaning \"danceable Latin music\", Ed Morales describes the usage in the same song as a cry from Pi\u00f1eiro to his band, telling them to increase the tempo to \"put the dancers into high gear\".<ref name=Morales56>Morales 2003, p. 56</ref> Morales claims that later in the 1930s, vocalist [[Beny Mor\u00e9]] would shout ''salsa'' during a performance \"to acknowledge a musical moment's heat, to express a kind of cultural nationalist sloganeering [and to celebrate the] 'hotness' or 'spiciness' of Latin American cultures\".<ref name=Morales56/> World music author Sue Steward claims ''salsa'' was originally used in music as a \"cry of appreciation for a particularly piquant or flashy solo\".<ref name=Steward488/> She cites the first use in this manner to a Venezuelan radio DJ named [[Phidias Danilo Escalona]];<ref name=Steward488/><ref>Waxer 2002, p. 6; Rond\u00f3n 1980, p. 33</ref> In 1955 [[Cheo Marquetti]] created a new band called Conjunto Los Salseros and recorded some new songs (Sonero and Que no muera el son).  In 1955 [[Jos\u00e9 Curbelo]] recorded some other salsa songs (La familia, La la la and Sun sun sun ba bae).\nThe contemporary meaning of ''salsa'' as a musical genre can be traced back to New York City Latin music promoter [[Izzy Sanabria]]:<ref>Boggs 1992, pp. 187-193.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In 1973, I hosted the television show ''Salsa'' which was the first reference to this particular music as ''salsa''. I was using [the term] ''salsa'', but the music wasn't defined by that. The music was still defined as Latin music. And that was a very, very broad category, because it even includes mariachi music. It includes everything. So salsa defined this particular type of music ... It's a name that everyone could pronounce.<ref>Boggs 1992, p. 190</ref></blockquote>\n\nSanabria's ''Latin New York'' magazine was an English language publication. Consequently, his promoted events were covered in ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines. They reported on this \"new\" phenomenon taking New York by storm\u2014''salsa''.<ref>Boggs 1992, p. 192. Izzy Sanabria: \"In Santo Domingo ... they told me that they don't recognize a Dominican artist as having made it in New York City unless a photograph and something written on this artist appears in ''Latin New York''. I said 'but why?' And what he said: 'Because we consider ''Latin New York'' a North American publication.' You see what I mean? In other words, it's an American publication. It was in English. So because it was in English, because it was from America, then it's legitimate. That in a sense, was the major impact of ''Latin New York''.\"</ref>\n\nBut promotion certainly wasn't the only factor in the music's success, as Sanabria makes clear: \"Musicians were busy creating the music but played no role in promoting the name salsa.\"<ref name=\"Izzy Sanabria 2005\">Izzy Sanabria 2005</ref> Johnny Pacheco, the creative director and producer of Fania Records, molded New York salsa into a tight, polished and commercially successful sound. The unprecedented appeal of New York salsa, particularly the \"Fania sound\", led to its adoption across Latin America and elsewhere.\n\nGlobally, the term salsa has eclipsed the original names of the various Cuban musical genres it encompasses. Ironically, Cuban-based music was promoted more effectively worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s by the salsa industry, than by Cuba. For a brief time in the early 1990s a fair number of Cuban musicians embraced the term, calling their own music ''salsa Cubana''.<ref name=\"Maule\u00f3n 1999, p. 80\">Maule\u00f3n 1999, p. 80</ref> The practice did not catch on however.\n\n==Issues of identity and ownership==\n[[File:Machito and his sister Graciella Grillo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Graciela]] on [[claves]] and her brother [[Machito]] on [[maraca]]s; Machito said that ''salsa'' was much like what he had been playing from the 1940s.]]\nThere is considerable controversy surrounding the term salsa and the idea that it is its own distinct genre. Several Cuban New York musicians who had already been performing Cuban dance music for decades when salsa was popularized initially scoffed at the term. For example, Cuban-born [[Machito]] declared: \"There's nothing new about salsa, it is just the same old music that was played in Cuba for over fifty years.\"<ref name=\"Izzy Sanabria 2005\"/> Similarly, New York native [[Tito Puente]] stated: \"The only salsa I know is sold in a bottle called ketchup. I play Cuban music.\"<ref name=Aparicio65/> Eventually though, both Machito and Puente embraced the term as a financial necessity.<ref>In 1983, Machito won a Grammy Award in the Best Latin Recording category for ''Machito and his Salsa Big Band '82'' Timeless CD 168.</ref><ref>Izzy Sanabria 2005. \"Years later, [Tito] Puente told me, 'Izzy you remember how much I hated and resisted the term salsa? Well I've had to accept it because wherever I travel, I find my records under the category of salsa.'\"</ref>\n\nThe salsa conflict can be summarized as a disagreement between those who do not recognize salsa as anything other than Cuban music with another name,<ref name=Steward488/><ref name=Aparicio65>Aparicio 1998, p. 65. [[P\u00e9rez Prado]]: \"There is no such thing as salsa.\"<br />[[Willie Col\u00f3n]]: \"Salsa is the harmonic sum of all Latin culture that meets in New York.\"<br />Concierto Expo 92, Seville, Spain: \"Salsa is Puerto Rico.\"</ref> and those who strongly identify with salsa as a music and culture distinct from its Cuban primogenitor.<ref name=Aparicio65/>\n\nThe concept of ''salsa music'' which began as a marketing ploy created by Izzy Sanabria was successfully exploited by Fania Records, then eventually took on a life of its own, organically evolving into an authentic pan-Latin American cultural identity. Music professor and salsa trombonist Christopher Washburne writes:\n\n<blockquote>This pan-Latino association of salsa stems from what Felix Padilla labels a 'Latinizing' process that occurred in the 1960s and was consciously marketed by Fania Records: 'To Fania, the Latinizing of salsa came to mean homogenizing the product, presenting an all-embracing Puerto Rican, Pan-American or Latino sound with which the people from all of Latin America and Spanish-speaking communities in the United States could identify and purchase.' Motivated primarily by economic factors, Fania's push for countries throughout Latin America to embrace salsa did result in an expanded market. But in addition, throughout the 1970s, salsa groups from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, among other Latin American nations, emerged, composing and performing music that related to their own specific cultural experiences and affiliations, which posited salsa as a cultural identity marker for those nations as well.<ref>Washburne 2008, p. 105</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Cuban origins of the music do not conveniently fit into the pan-Latino narrative. Many leading salsa artists have described salsa in broad and inclusive, but vague terms, making no mention of the music's Cuban foundation. For example, Johnny Pacheco has consistently articulated a vision of salsa as a broad, multi-ethnic movement: \"Salsa was, and still is, a Caribbean musical movement.\"<ref>Steward 1999, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Similarly, [[Willie Col\u00f3n]] sees the scope of salsa's power to unite in the broadest terms: \"Salsa was the force that united diverse Latino and other non-Latino racial and ethnic groups ... It is a concept. An open, ever-evolving musical, cultural, socio-political concept.\"<ref>Fuentes 2003, p. 59</ref> Rub\u00e9n Blades' definition of salsa is also inclusive: \"Salsa music is urban folklore at the international level.\"<ref name=Aparicio65/> Journalist Scott Heller writes, \"[Salsa music] circulates across national boundaries, becoming a useful example of the globalization of culture and of the ways that people build community in diaspora.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Salsa: a Hybrid Form That Reflects the Globalization of Culture|last=Heller|first=Scott|date=May 1, 1998|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=}}</ref> As an example of this, ethnomusicologist Ed Morales notes that the interaction of Latino rhythms and Jazz music in mid-twentieth century New York was crucial to the innovation of both forms of music. Musicians who would become great innovators of Salsa, like Mario Bauza and [[Chano Pozo]], began their careers in New York working in close conjunction with some of the biggest names in Jazz, like Cab Calloway, Ella Fitzgerald, and Dizzy Gillespie, among others, Morales noted that: \"The interconnection between North American jazz and Afro-Cuban music was taken for granted, and the stage was set for the emergence of mambo music in New York, where music fans were becoming accustomed to innovation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Latin Beat: Rhythms and Roots of Latin Music from Bossa Nova to Salsa and Beyond|last=Morales|first=Ed|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0306810183|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/latinbeatrhythms00mora_0/page/41 41]|url=https://archive.org/details/latinbeatrhythms00mora_0/page/41}}</ref> He later notes that Mambo helped pave the way for the widespread acceptance of Salsa years later. In the pivotal documentary movie ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in Cities'' (1979), the history of salsa is explained as a mixing of African, Caribbean, and New York cultures and musics, with no mention of Cuba. In one scene, the Afro-Cuban folkloric genres of bat\u00e1 and rumba are shown being performed in Puerto Rico, implying that they originated there.\n\nIn advancing the concept of salsa as a musical \"sauce\", containing many different ingredients from various cultures mixed together, some point to the occasional use of non-Cuban forms in salsa, such as the Puerto Rican bomba. The percentage of salsa compositions based in non-Cuban genres is low though, and despite an openness to experimentation and a willingness to absorb non-Cuban influences, - such as Jazz and of Rock and Roll, with regards to formal structure, and many other informal influences from talented musicians of a broad range of musical and ethnic backgrounds; such as Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Italians and Jews: anyone with talent and the will to experiment<ref>{{Cite book|title=Faces of Salsa: A Spoken History of the Music|last=Fuentes|first=Leonardo|publisher=Smithsonian Books|year=2003|isbn=978-1588340801|location=|pages=}}</ref> - salsa has remained consistently wedded to its Cuban templates.<ref>Gerard 1989, p. 7. The popularity of Puerto Rican t\u00edpica music peaked in New York City in 1957, more than a decade before the emergence of salsa. \"It is ironic that in a music dominated by Nuyorican and Puerto Rican musicians, the use of the folk music of Puerto Rico has never been very popular. According to Frankie Malabe, 'In a live performance ... you'll rarely get any bombas and plenas.'\"</ref> It was common practice for salsa bands to resurrect pre-salsa Cuban classics. For example, several of [[Arsenio Rodriguez]]'s son montunos from the 1940s, such as \"Fuego en el 23\" (recorded by [[Sonora Ponce\u00f1a]]) and \"El divorcio\" (recorded by [[Johnny Pacheco]]) were modernized by salsa arrangers. The pan-Latin Americanism of salsa is found in its cultural milieu, more than its musical structure.<ref>Washburne 2008, p. 40. Washburne notes that Willie Col\u00f3n is an exception. He advocated a broader Latin American identity, while creating salsa that deliberately drew upon a variety of Latin American and Caribbean musics.</ref> Today, competing nationalities claim ownership of the music, as there are musicians in New York City, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela, who claim salsa was invented in their country.<ref>The five-part VHS series ''Salsa'' (Bongo Video Productions, London, c. early 1990s) interviews people from Cuba, New York City, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela, all of whom claim that salsa was invented in their country.</ref>\n\nThe salsa controversy is also closely tied to the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the [[United States embargo against Cuba]]. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from [[Cuban exile]]s) for playing Cuban records over the air.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana|last=Bardach|first=Ann Louise|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9780307425423|location=|pages=112}}</ref> Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term ''salsa music'' was a euphemism for authentic [[Cuban music]] stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 494</ref>\n\n[[Mayra Mart\u00ednez]], a Cuban musicologist, writes that \"the term ''salsa'' was used to obscure the Cuban base, the music's history or part of its history in Cuba. And salsa was a way to do this so that Jerry Masucci, Fania and other record companies, like CBS, could have a hegemony on the music and keep the Cuban musicians from spreading their music abroad.\"<ref name=Boggs189/> Izzy Sanabria responds that Mart\u00ednez was likely giving an accurate Cuban viewpoint, \"but salsa was not planned that way\".<ref name=Boggs189>Boggs 1992, p. 189</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\nSalsa lyrics range from simple dance numbers, and sentimental romantic songs, to risque and politically radical subject matter. Music author [[Isabelle Leymarie]] notes that salsa performers often incorporate [[macho]]istic [[wikt:bravado|bravado]] (''guaper\u00eda'') in their lyrics, in a manner reminiscent of [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[samba music|samba]], a theme she ascribes to the performers' \"humble backgrounds\" and subsequent need to compensate for their origins. Leymarie claims that salsa is \"essentially virile, an affirmation of the man's pride and identity\". As an extension of salsa's macho stance, manly taunts and challenges (''desafio'') are also a traditional part of salsa.<ref name=\"Leymarie, pp. 268-269\">Leymarie, pp. 268-269</ref>\n\nSalsa lyrics often quote from traditional Cuban sones and rumbas. Sometimes there are references to Afro-Cuban religions, such as ''[[Santeria]]'', even by artists who are not themselves practitioners of the faith.<ref>Steward, pp. 495-496 Steward mentions Celia Cruz as not being an adherent of Santeria, yet who refers to the goddess [[Yemaya]] in her performances.</ref> Salsa lyrics also exhibit Puerto Rican influences. Hector LaVoe, who sang with Willie Col\u00f3n for nearly a decade used typical Puerto Rican phrasing in his singing.<ref>Gerard 1989 p. 7</ref> It's not uncommon now to hear the Puerto Rican declamatory exclamation \"le-lo-lai\" in salsa.<ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', p. 74</ref> Politically and socially activist composers have long been an important part of salsa, and some of their works, like Eddie Palmieri's \"La libertad - l\u00f3gico\", became Latin, and especially Puerto Rican anthems. The Panamanian-born singer [[Rub\u00e9n Blades|Ruben Blades]] in particular is well known for his socially-conscious and incisive salsa lyrics about everything from [[imperialism]] to [[disarmament]] and [[environmentalism]], which have resonated with audiences throughout Latin America.<ref>Manuel, ''Caribbean Currents'', pg. 80</ref> Many salsa songs contain a nationalist theme, centered around a sense of pride in black Latino identity, and may be in Spanish, English or a mixture of the two called ''[[Spanglish]].''<ref name=\"Leymarie, pp. 268-269\"/>\n\n==Instrumentation==\n===Son Conjunto===\n[[File:Bongos Meinl HB100-NT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bongos.]]\n\nSalsa ensembles are typically based on one of two different Cuban instrument formats, either the horn-based son conjunto or the string-based charanga. In the 30's, [[Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez]] added a second, and then, third trumpet{{snd}}the birth of the Latin horn section. He made the bold move of adding the conga drum, the quintessential Afro-Cuban instrument. Some bands are expanded to the size of a mambo big band, but they can be thought of as an enlarged conjunto. The traditional conjunto format consists of congas, bongos, bass, piano, [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]], a horn section, and the smaller hand-held percussion instruments: claves, gu\u00edro, or maracas, played by the singers. The Cuban horn section traditionally consists of trumpets, but trombones are frequently used in salsa. The section can also use a combination of different horns. Most salsa bands are based on the conjunto model, but the tres is almost never used.\n\n===String charanga===\nThe traditional charanga format consists of congas, [[timbales]], bass, piano, flute, and a string section of violins, viola, and cello. The [[clave (rhythm)|claves]] and [[g\u00fciro]] are played by the singers. Bongos are not typically used in charanga bands. [[T\u00edpica 73]] and Orquesta Broadway were two popular New York salsa bands in the charanga format.\n\n===Percussion===\nNew York based Machito's [[Afro-Cubans]] was the first band to make the triumvirate of congas, bongo, and timbales the standard battery of percussion in Cuban-based dance music.<ref>Bobby Sanabria 2008 ''Latinjazz''.</ref> The three drums are used together in most salsa bands and function in ways similar to a traditional folkloric drum ensemble. The timbales play the bell pattern, the congas play the supportive drum part, and the bongos improvise, simulating a lead drum. The improvised variations of the bongos are executed within the context of a repetitive marcha, known as the ''martillo'' ('hammer'), and do not constitute a solo. The bongos play primarily during the verses and the piano solos. When the song transitions into the montuno section, the bongo player picks up a large hand held cowbell called the bongo bell. Often the ''bongocero'' plays the bell more during a piece, than the actual bongos. The interlocking counterpoint of the timbale bell and bongo bell provides a propelling force during the montuno. The maracas and gu\u00edro sound a steady flow of regular pulses (subdivisions) and are ordinarily clave-neutral.\n\n==Music structure==\n===Verse and chorus sections===\nMost salsa compositions follow the basic son montuno model of a verse section, followed by a [[coro-preg\u00f3n]] (call-and-response) chorus section known as the [[montuno]]. The verse section can be short, or expanded to feature the lead vocalist and/or carefully crafted melodies with clever rhythmic devices. Once the montuno section begins, it usually continues until the end of the song. The tempo may gradually increase during the montuno in order to build excitement. The montuno section can be divided into various sub-sections sometimes referred to as ''mambo'', ''diablo'', ''mo\u00f1a'', and ''especial''.<ref>Bobby Sanabria 1998 ''Latinjazz''.</ref>\n\n===Clave===\n[[File:Claves.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pair of claves.]]\n\nThe most fundamental rhythmic element in salsa music is a pattern and concept known as [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]. Clave is a Spanish word meaning '[[code]],' 'key,' as in key to a mystery or puzzle, or '[[keystone (architecture)|keystone]],' the wedge-shaped stone in the center of an arch that ties the other stones together.<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 85.</ref> Clave is also the name of the patterns played on [[claves]]; two hardwood sticks used in [[Afro-Cuban music]] ensembles.

Bottom: basic conga tumbao on one drum. S: slap, O: open tone, h: palm heel, t: finger tips.]]\n\nThe concept of clave as a form of music theory with its accompanying terminology, was fully developed during the big band era of the 1940s, when dance bands in Havana and New York City were enlarged.<ref>Bobby Sanabria: \"The concept of utilizing 3-2 and 2-3 as a terminology developed in New York City. I have done research on this with many of the legendary figures in this tradition, most notably Mario Bauz\u00e1, who I played with for eight years.\" Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 248.</ref>  By the time salsa emerged in the 1970s, there was already a second generation of clave savvy composers and arrangers working in New York. John Santos stresses the importance of this skill:\n\n<blockquote>One of the most difficult applications of the clave is in the realm of composition and arrangement of Cuban and Cuban-based dance music. Regardless of the instrumentation, the music for all of the instruments of the ensemble must be written with a very keen and conscious rhythmic relationship to the clave ... Any 'breaks' and/or 'stops' in the arrangements must also be 'in clave'. If these procedures are not properly taken into consideration, then the music is 'out of clave' which, if not done intentionally, is considered an error. When the rhythm and music are 'in clave,' a great natural 'swing' is produced, regardless of the tempo. All musicians who write and/or interpret Cuban-based music must be 'clave conscious,' not just the percussionists.<ref>Santos 1986 p. 32.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSalsa is a potent expression of clave, and clave became a rhythmic symbol of the musical movement, as its popularity spread. Clave awareness within the salsa community has served as a cultural \"boundary marker\", creating an insider/outsider dichotomy, between Cuban and non-Cuban, and between Latino and non-Latino. At the same time though, clave serves its ancient function of providing a means of profound inclusion. As Washburne observes:\n\n<blockquote>Clapping clave at a concert in sync with the performing musicians provides for a group participation in music-making even for a novice. However, the messages transmitted can be, and often are, imbued with more meaning than simply, 'Let's all participate!' A newcomer to salsa, whether performer, dancer, listener, or consumer, must acquire some level of clave competence before engaging in these 'clave dialogues' in a deeper, more significant way.<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 195.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore salsa pianist Eddie Palmieri takes his first solo at a live concert, he will often stand up, and start clapping clave. Once the audience is clapping clave along with him, Palmieri will sit back down at the piano and proceed to take his solo. Palmieri's solos tend to be rhythmically complex, with avant-garde elements such as harmonic dissonance. By clapping clave along with Palmieri's solo, the audience is able to both \"de-code\" its rather esoteric musical \"message\", and participate in its creation at a fundamental level.\n\nClave is the basic [[period (music)|period]], composed of two rhythmically opposed [[cell (music)|cells]], one antecedent and the other consequent. Clave was initially written in two measures of {{music|time|2|4}} (below).<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1999: p. 6.</ref> When clave is written in two measures, each cell or clave half is represented within a single measure. The antecedent half has three strokes and is referred to as the ''three-side'' of clave in the parlance of salsa. In Cuban popular music, the first three strokes of son clave are also known collectively as [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]], a Spanish word meaning 'triplet' (three equal beats in the same time as two main beats).<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 38.</ref> However, in the Cuban vernacular, the term refers to the figure shown below in the first measure.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 51.</ref> The consequent half (second measure) of clave has two strokes and is called the ''two-side'' by salsa musicians.\n\n[[File:Son clave 3 side and 2 side-B.png|thumb|center|420px|Clave has a binary structure.]]\n\nThe first measure of clave is considered \"strong\", contradicting the meter with three [[cross beat]]s and generating a sense of forward momentum. The second measure is considered \"weak\". Clave resolves in the second measure when the last stroke coincides with the last main beat of the cycle.<ref>Emilio Grenet: \"[The] melodic design is constructed on a rhythmic pattern of two measures, as though both were only one, the first is antecedent, strong, and the second is consequent, weak.\" 1939 p. XV.</ref> John Amria describes the rhythmic sequence of clave:\n\n<blockquote>[With] clave ... the two measures are not at odds, but rather, they are balanced opposites like positive and negative, expansive and contractive or the poles of a magnet. As the pattern is repeated, an alternation from one polarity to the other takes place creating pulse and rhythmic drive. Were the pattern to be suddenly reversed, the rhythm would be destroyed as in a reversing of one magnet within a series ... the patterns are held in place according to both the internal relationships between the drums and their relationship with clave ... Should the [music] fall out of clave the internal momentum of the rhythm will be dissipated and perhaps even broken.<ref>Amira 1992 pp. 23-24.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Percussion and clave alignment===\nSince a chord progression can begin on either side of clave, percussionists have to be able to initiate their parts in either half (a single measure in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|2|4}}). The following examples show clave with the bongo bell and timbale bell parts in both a 3-2 and a 2-3 sequence. The timbale bell comes from a stick pattern (c\u00e1scara) used in the Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythm [[guaguanc\u00f3]].\n[[File:3-2clave and bells cut-time.tif|thumb|center|350px|Timbale bell and bongo bell (bottom) in 3-2 clave.]]\n[[File:2-3clave and bells cut-time.tif|thumb|center|350px|Timbale bell and bongo bell (bottom) in 2-3 clave.]]\n\nThe following example shows the most common conga (two drums), timbale bell, and bongo bell pattern combination used in salsa music.<ref>According to [[Changuito]], this timbale bell pattern was created by the percussionist Agapito of [[Orquesta Arag\u00f3n]]. ''Evolution of the Tumbadoras''. Changuito. Alfred Publishing Co (1996: VHS).</ref>\n[[File:Congas and bells in correct 2-3 alignment.tif|thumb|center|330px|From top: 2-3 clave, timbale bell, bongo bell, two congas.]]\nAccording to [[Bobby Sanabria]], the 3-2, 2-3 concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Cuban-born [[Mario Bauz\u00e1]], when he was music director of Machito's Afro-Cubans.<ref>Bobby Sanabria quoted by Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 248</ref> The 3-2, 2-3 concept is a basic tenet of salsa, but it is not widely used in Cuba.<ref>Mongo Santamaria: \"Don't tell me about 3-2 or 2-3! In Cuba we just play. We feel it, we don't talk about such things\"\u2014quoted by Washburne 2008 p. 190.</ref><ref>The contemporary Cuban bassist, composer and arranger Alain P\u00e9rez flatly states: \"In Cuba we do not use that 2-3, 3-2 formula ... 2-3, 3-2 [is] not used in Cuba. That is how people learn Cuban music outside Cuba\"\u2014Timba.com 2002.http://www.timba.com/artist_pages/alain-p-rez-interview-part-2?lang=en-US</ref>\n\n===Guajeo===\nA [[guajeo]] is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. Guajeos are a seamless blend of European harmonic and African rhythmic structures. A piano guajeo may be played during the verse section of a song, but it is at the center of the montuno section. That is why some salsa musicians refer to piano guajeos as ''montunos''. Piano guajeos are one of the most recognizable elements in salsa music. As [[Sonny Bravo]] explains: \"In salsa, the piano is more of a percussion instrument than a melodic one, especially in ensemble playing. When you're backing a soloist, you play a riff over and over again. This is what we call ''guajeo''. The pianist uses this guajeo to provide the rhythm section with its drive.\"<ref>Boggs, Vernon W., ed. 1991 p. 318. Sonny Bravo quote in \"Secrets of Salsa Rhythm.\"</ref>\n\nClave and guajeos are commonly written in two measures of [[cut time]] ({{music|time|2|2}}) in salsa charts. This is most likely an influence of jazz conventions.<ref>Maule\u00f3n 1999 p. 6.</ref><ref>While most salsa charts are written in cut-time, the common-time ({{music|time|4|4}}) time signature is often used. In other words, the time signature that is used does not literally reflect actual metric structure. This has led to the practice of counting eight beats (quarter-notes) per clave, while tapping one's foot four times (half-notes) per clave (see: Maule\u00f3n 1993: 47-48, and Pe\u00f1alosa 2010: 218-219).</ref>\n\nMost guajeos have a binary structure that expresses clave. Kevin Moore states: \"There are two common ways that the three-side is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Pe\u00f1alosa calls 'clave motif,' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Moore 2011 p. 32. ''Understanding Clave''.</ref> The following guajeo example is based on a clave motif. The three-side (first measure) consists of the tresillo variant known as [[cinquillo]].\n\n[[File:3-2 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Piano guajeo: clave motif ({{audio|3-2 guajeo.mid|Play}})]]\n\nA chord progression can begin on either side of clave. In salsa \"one\" can be on either side of clave, because the harmonic progression, rather than the rhythmic progression is the primary referent.<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa 2010 p. 136.</ref> When a chord progression begins on the two-side of clave, the music is said to be in ''two-three clave''. The following guajeo is based on the clave motif in a two-three sequence. The cinquillo rhythm is now in the second measure.\n\n[[File:2-3 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|500px|2-3 piano guajeo: clave motif ({{audio|2-3 guajeo.mid|Play}})]]\n\nMoore: \"By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Pe\u00f1alosa calls the 'offbeat/onbeat motif.' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> With this type of guajeo motif, the three-side of clave is expressed with all offbeats. The following I IV V IV progression is in a three-two clave sequence. It begins with an offbeat pick-up on the pulse immediately before beat 1. With some guajeos, offbeats at the end of the two-side, or onbeats at the end of the three-side serve as pick-ups leading into the next measure (when clave is written in two measures).\n\n[[File:B guajeo.tif|thumb|center|450px|3-2 guajeo: offbeat/onbeat motif ({{audio|B guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]\n\nThis guajeo is in two-three clave because it begins on the downbeat, emphasizing the onbeat quality of the two-side. The figure has the same exact harmonic sequence as the previous example, but rhythmically, the attack-point sequence of the two measures is reversed. Most salsa is in two-three clave, and most salsa piano guajeos are based on the two-three onbeat/offbeat motif.\n\n[[File:Two three guajeo.tif|thumb|center|450px|2-3 guajeo: onbeat/offbeat motif ({{audio|Two three guajeo.mid|Play}}).]]\n\nWhen salsa uses non-Cuban rhythms, such as a Puerto Rican plena, guajeos are essential to tie that genre in with the salsa format. The expression of the 2-3 onbeat/offbeat motif is more abstract in this guajeo than in others previous mentioned.<ref>After Maule\u00f3n 1993 p. 213.</ref> The offbeat and onbeat pick ups begin at their extreme limit in the preceding measures. The third measure outlines a G7 chord. The other measures outline C.\n[[File:Plena guajeo.tif|thumb|center|370px|2-3 plena guajeo: onbeat/offbeat motif.]]\n\n===Bass tumbao===\nMost salsa bass [[tumbao]]s are based on the tresillo pattern. Often the last note of the measure (ponche) is held over the downbeat of the next measure. In this way, only the two offbeats of tresillo are sounded. This tumbao is clave-neutral.\n[[File:Tresillo based tumbaos.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Clave-neutral tresillo-based tumbao.]]\n\nSome salsa tumbaos that have a specific alignment with clave. The following 2-3 bass line coincides with three of the clave's five strokes.\n\n===Mo\u00f1as===\nA mo\u00f1a is a horn guajeo, which can be written or improvised.<ref>Maule\u00f3n, Rebeca (1993: 256). ''Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble''. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. {{ISBN|0-9614701-9-4}}.</ref> What's known as the Cuban ''t\u00edpico style'' of soloing on trombone draws upon the technique of stringing together mo\u00f1a variations. The following example shows five different variants of a 2-3 trombone mo\u00f1a improvised by Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez  on \"Bilongo\" (c. 1969), performed by Eddie Palmieri.\n\nMo\u00f1a 1 sounds every stroke of 2-3 clave except the first stroke of the three-side. Melodic variety is created by transposing the module in accordance to the harmonic sequence, as Rick Davies observes in his detailed analysis of the first mo\u00f1a:\n\n<blockquote>The mo\u00f1a consists of a two-measure module and its repetition, which is altered to reflect the montuno chord progression. The module begins with four ascending eighth-notes starting on the second [quarter-note of the measure]. This configuration emphasizes the ... two-side of the clave. In both of the modules, these four notes move from G3 to Eb4. Although the first, third, and fourth notes (G3, C4, and Eb4) are identical in both modules, the second note reflects the change in harmony. In the first module, this note is the Bb3 third of the tonic harmony; in the module repetition, the A3 is the fifth of the dominant. Of the final five notes in the module, the first four are [offbeats]; the final D4 is on the [last quarter-note] in the second measure of the module. Along with the final D4, the initial D4 on the [last offbeat] in the first measure of the module and the Eb4 on the [offbeat] immediately preceding the final note of the module are identical in both modules. The [offbeats] in the second-module measure reflect the harmonic changes. The first version of the module is over the dominant chord and contains the pitches A3 (the fifth) and C4 (the seventh). A Bb3 is sounded twice on the two [offbeats] in the module's repetition and represents the third G minor tonic chord.<ref>Davies, Rick (2003: 149). ''Trompeta; Chappott\u00edn, Chocolate, and the Afro-Cuban Trumpet Styl''e. {{ISBN|0-8108-4680-2}}.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nA section of layered, contrapuntal horn guajeos is also referred to sometimes as a mo\u00f1a. Mo\u00f1as differ from typical rhythm section guajeos in that they often will rest for a beat or two within their cycle. Those beats within a measure not sounded by the mo\u00f1a are often \"filled\" by a chorus, or counter mo\u00f1a. The trumpet and trombone mo\u00f1as shown below (\"Bilongo\") can be repeated verbatim, or altered. Improvisation is within a framework of repetition and the melodic contour of the mo\u00f1as. In this way, multiple instrumentalists can improvise simultaneously while reinforcing the rhythmic/melodic momentum of the rhythm section.<ref>Davies, Rick (2003: 149). ''Trompeta; Chappott\u00edn, Chocolate, and the Afro-Cuban Trumpet Style.'' {{ISBN|0-8108-4680-2}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Trombone trumpet monas (corrected chart).tif|thumb|center|450px|2-3 trumpet and trombone mo\u00f1as, \"Bilongo\" (c. 1969) Top: trumpet; bottom: trombone.]]\n\nThe next mo\u00f1a layers are from the descarga \"Guatacando\" by the [[Fania All-Stars]] (1968). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8-GRxX2s0s Listen: Guatacando.\"] The trumpet figure is one clave in length, while the trombone figure is two claves. This is a classic example of how mo\u00f1as are layered. The trombone Mo\u00f1a consists of two parts, a call-and-response structure. The trumpet mo\u00f1a begins on the last note of first half of the trombone mo\u00f1a. The second half of the trombone mo\u00f1a begins on the pulse (subdivision) immediately following the last note of the trumpet mo\u00f1a.\n\n[[File:Guatacando monas.tif|thumb|center|450px|2-3 trumpet and trombone mo\u00f1as, \"Guatacando\" (1968). 1. trumpets; 2. trombones.]]\n\n==History==\n===Pre-salsa: Cuban dance music in New York City 1940s-1970s===\n[[File:The Palladium Ballroom.gif|thumb|left|280px|The Palladium Ballroom, home of the mambo, c. 1950s.]]\nSalsa emerged from New York City in the mid-1970s, then spread throughout Latin America and the Western Hemisphere.<ref name=Manuel46/> However, the music had already been going strong in the city for several decades prior to the use of the label ''salsa''. New York had been a center of Cuban-style dance music since the 1940s, when landmark innovations by Machito's Afro-Cubans helped usher in the mambo era. Tito Puente worked for a time in the Afro-Cubans before starting up his own successful band. By the early 1950s, there were three very popular mambo big bands in New York: Machito and his Afro-Cubans, Tito Puente, and [[Tito Rodr\u00edguez]]. There were many other working bands as well. The [[Palladium Ballroom]] was the epicenter of mambo in New York. At the height of its popularity, the Palladium attracted [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stars, especially on Wednesday nights, when a free dance lesson was offered. The mambo and its \"temple\", the Palladium, were racially and ethnically integrated phenomena.\n\nThe next Cuban \"dance craze\" to hit the United States was the chachach\u00e1. The chachach\u00e1 originated in the Cuban charanga bands, but was adopted by the horn-based groups in New York. By the early 1960s, there were several charanga bands in New York, led by future salsa icons Johnny Pacheco, Charlie Palmieri, and Ray Barretto. Mongo Santamar\u00eda also had a charanga  during this period. The [[pachanga]] was popularized by Orquesta Sublime and other Cuban charangas. The pachanga was the last Cuban popular dance to take ahold in New York's Latin community. The U.S. embargo against Cuba (1962) halted the two-way flow of music and musicians between Cuba and the United States.\n\nThe first post-Revolution Cuban dance music genre was the short-lived, but highly influential [[mozambique (music)|mozambique]] (1963).{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Neither the dance, nor the music caught on outside of Cuba. In spite of this, members of Eddie Palmieri's ''Conjunto la Perfecta'' did hear this new music over shortwave radio, inspiring them to create a similar rhythm which they also called mozambique. Although the two rhythms share no parts in common, the band received death threats because some right wing Cuban exiles thought Palmieri's band was playing contemporary Cuban music.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nThere was one final distinct Latin music era in New York before salsa emerged, and it was an original, home-grown hybrid: the Latin [[boogaloo]] (or boogal\u00fa). By the mid-1960s, a hybrid Nuyorican cultural identity emerged, primarily Puerto Rican but influenced by many Latin cultures as well as the close contact with African Americans.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 489.</ref> The boogaloo was a true Nuyorican music, a bi-lingual mix of R&B and Cuban rhythms. It had two Top 20 hits in 1963: Mongo Santamar\u00eda's performance of the [[Herbie Hancock]] piece \"[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]\" and [[Ray Barretto]]'s \"El Watusi\", which in a sense, established the basic boogaloo formula. The term ''boogaloo'' was probably coined in about 1966 by [[Richie Ray]] and [[Bobby Cruz]]. The biggest boogaloo hit of the 60s was \"Bang Bang\" by the [[Joe Cuba]] Sextet, which achieved unprecedented success for [[Latin music in the United States]] in 1966 when it sold over one million copies. \"El Pito\" was another hit by this popular combo. Hits by other groups included [[Johnny Colon|Johnny Col\u00f3n]]'s \"Boogaloo Blues\", Pete Rodr\u00edguez's \"I Like It like That\", and Hector Rivera's \"At the Party\". [[Joe Bataan]] and the [[Lebron Brothers]] are two other important boogaloo bands.\n\nIn 1966, the same year as Joe Cuba's pop success, the Palladium closed because it lost its liquor license.<ref name=\"Steward\">Steward, Sue 1999.

Inspired by these movements, Latinos in New York formed the [[Young Lords]], rejected assimilation and \"made the barrio a cauldron of militant assertiveness and artistic creativity\".<ref>Manuel 2006, p. 90</ref> The musical aspect of this social change was based on the Cuban son, which had long been the favored musical form for urbanites in both Puerto Rico  and New York.<ref>Manuel 1995, p. 73</ref> The Manhattan-based recording company Fania Records introduced many of the first-generation salsa singers and musicians to the world. Founded by Dominican flautist and band-leader Johnny Pacheco and impresario [[Jerry Masucci]], Fania was launched with Willie Col\u00f3n and [[H\u00e9ctor Lavoe]]'s ''El Malo'' in 1967. This was followed by a series of updated son montuno and [[plena]] tunes that evolved into modern salsa by 1973. Pacheco put together a team that included percussionist [[Louie Ramirez]], bassist [[Bobby Valent\u00edn]] and arranger [[Larry Harlow (salsa)|Larry Harlow]]. The Fania team released a string of successful singles, mostly ''son'' and ''plena'', performing live after forming the [[Fania All-Stars]]\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:RogerDawson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Roger Dawson]] hosted a very popular New York radio show featuring salsa.]]\nIn 1971 the Fania All-Stars sold out [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].<ref name=\"steward488_489\">Steward 2000, pp. 488\u2013489</ref> By the early 1970s, the music's center moved to Manhattan and the [[Cheetah (nightclub)|Cheetah]], where promoter [[Ralph Mercado]] introduced many future Puerto Rican salsa stars to an ever-growing and diverse crowd of Latino audiences.  The 1970s also brought new semi-known Salsa Bands from New York City, Bands like Angel Canales, Andy Harlow (Larry Harlow's brother), [[Chino Rodriguez]] y su Consagracion ([[Chino Rodriguez]] was one of the first Chinese Puerto Rican artist that cued the eye of Fania Record's owner Jerry Masucci and later became the Booking Agent for many of the Fania Artists.), Wayne Gorbea, Ernie Agusto y la Conspiracion, Orchestra Ray Jay, Orchestra Fuego, and Orchestra Cimarron, amongst other bands that were performing in the Salsa market in the East Coast of the USA. \nIn 1975 New York, DJ and conga drummer, [[Roger Dawson]] created the \"Sunday Salsa Show\" over WRVR FM which became one of the highest-rated radio shows in the New York market with a reported audience of over a quarter of a million listeners every Sunday (per Arbitron Radio Ratings). Ironically, although New York's Hispanic population at that time was over two million, there had been no commercial Hispanic FM. Given his jazz and salsa conga playing experience and knowledge (working as a sideman with such bands as salsa's Frankie Dante's Orquesta Flamboyan and jazz saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]]), Dawson also created the long-running \"Salsa Meets Jazz\" weekly concert series at the [[Village Gate]] jazz club where jazz musicians would sit in with an established salsa band, for example [[Dexter Gordon]] jamming with the Machito band. Dawson helped to broaden New York's salsa audience and introduced new artists such as the bi-lingual Angel Canales who were not given play on the Hispanic AM stations of that time. His show won several awards from the readers of Latin New York magazine, Izzy Sanabria's ''Salsa Magazine'' at that time and ran until late 1980 when Viacom changed the format of WRVR to [[country music]].<ref>Manuel 1990, p. 48</ref>\n\nFrom New York, salsa quickly expanded to Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries. The number of salsa bands, both in New York and elsewhere, increased dramatically, as did salsa-oriented radio stations and record labels. \n[[File:Cuatro de puerto rico.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cuatro (Puerto Rico)|Puerto Rican ''cuatro'']] with ten strings]]\nThe 1970s saw a number of musical innovations among salsa musicians. Willie Col\u00f3n introduced the ''[[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]'', a rural Puerto Rican [[plucked string instrument]], as well as some songs with jazz, rock, and [[music of Panama|Panamanian]] and [[music of Brazil|Brazilian music]] influences.<ref>Leymarie 2003, pp. 272\u2013273, Leymarie cites the 1972 double Christmas album ''Asalto navide\u00f1o'' as the \"first time that (the ''cuatro'') and Puerto Rico's country music appeared in salsa.\"</ref>\n\n[[Celia Cruz]], who had a successful career in Cuba, was able to transition well to salsa in the United States. She became known as the Queen of Salsa. Larry Harlow, a bandleader, and arranger for Fania Records, modernized salsa by adding an [[electric piano]]. Harlow also stretched out from the typical salsa formula with his ambitious opera ''Hommy'' (1973), inspired by the Who's ''Tommy'', and integral to Celia Cruz's comeback from early retirement. In 1979 Harlow released his critically acclaimed ''La Raza Latina, a Salsa Suite''.\n\nThe slick, highly produced Fania sound was too predictably formulaic for some tastes. There was a niche for more adventurous Puerto Rican bands, such as Eddie Palmieri, and [[Manny Oquendo]]'s Libre. The two bands were the main proponents of NY-style Mozambique, drew inspiration from the classic Cuban composers, and Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythms, while pushing the limits of salsa, and incorporating jazz elements. They also featured some of the best trombone soloists in the business, several of whom were \"Anglo\" jazz musicians who had mastered the t\u00edpico style. Most famous of these was [[Barry Rogers]]. The Gonzalez brothers, Jerry and Andy, played congas and bass respectively, in Libre. Prior to the founding of Libre, they had played in one of Palmieri's most experimental salsa bands. Andy Gonzalez recounts: \"We were into improvising ... doing that thing [[Miles Davis]] was doing\u2014playing themes and just improvising on the themes of songs, and we never stopped playing through the whole set.\"<ref>Boggs 1992 p. 290. Andy Gonzalez quote.</ref> While in Palmieri's band (1974-1976), the Gonzalez brothers started showing up in the DownBeat Reader's Poll. Palmieri and Libre caught the attention of jazz critics and reached listening to audiences who were not necessarily a part of the salsa culture.\n\nBy the end of the decade, Fania Records' longtime leadership of salsa was weakened by the arrival of the labels [[Rodven Records|TH-Rodven]] and [[RMM Records & Video|RMM]].\n\n===Divergence of salsa and Cuban popular music===\nIronically, Cuban popular music during the 1970s incorporated North American jazz, rock, and funk in much more significant ways than did salsa. Whereas salsa occasionally superimposes elements of another genre, or incorporates a non-salsa style in the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] of a song, Cuban popular music since the 1970s has fully integrated North American jazz and funk to the point of true hybrid. It began with [[Juan Formell]], the former director for Orquesta Rev\u00e9 (1968), and the founder and current director of [[Los Van Van]]. Formell fused American pop with clave-based Cuban elements. Moore states: \"The harmonies, never before heard in Cuban music, were clearly borrowed from North American pop [and] shattered the formulaic limitations on harmony to which Cuban popular music had faithfully adhered for so long.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Moore, Kevin|date=2011|title=\"The Roots of Timba, Part II; Juan Formell y Los Van Van.\"|website=Timba.com|url=http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/juan-formell-y-los-van-van|access-date=2012-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408133626/http://www.timba.com/encyclopedia_pages/juan-formell-y-los-van-van|archive-date=2011-04-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Cuban super group [[Irakere]] fused [[bebop]] and [[funk]] with [[bat\u00e1 drum]]s and other Afro-Cuban folkloric elements. The 1970s was the [[songo music|songo]] era in Cuba, with groups like Los Van Van and Orquesta Ritmo Oriental playing a highly syncopated, rumba-influenced form of charanga.\n\nFor the most part, salsa music was not influenced by developments in Cuban popular music during the 1970s. One notable exception was Sonny Bravo of T\u00edpica '73, who arranged songs by contemporary Cuban charangas. In 1979 T\u00edpica '73 travelled to Havana to record ''T\u00edpica '73 en Cuba'', a collaboration between the band and Cuban musicians.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Oscar D Leon 2011.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Oscar D'Leon (2011).]]\nIn 1980 the [[Mariel boatlift]] brought thousands of Cuban refugees to the United States. Many of these refugees were musicians, who were astonished to hear what sounded to them like Cuban music from the 1950s. It was as if the 60s never happened. Cuban conguero Daniel Ponce summarized this sentiment: \"When the Cubans arrived in New York, they all said 'Yuk! This is old music.' The music and the feelings and arrangements [haven't] changed.\"<ref>Gerard 1989 p. 6. Daniel Ponce quote</ref> In fundamental ways, salsa is the preservation of the late 1950s Cuban sound.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nThe influx of Cuban musicians had more of an impact on jazz than salsa. After the boatlift though, there was obviously more awareness of the modern Cuban styles. Tito Puente recorded the Irakere composition \"Bacalao con pan\" (1980), and Rub\u00e9n Blades covered Los Van Van's \"Muevete\" (1985). The bands Batacumbele and Zaperoko of Puerto Rico fully embraced songo. Led by Angel \"Cachete\" Maldonado and featuring a young [[Giovanni Hidalgo]], Batacumbele interpreted songo in a horn-based format, with a strong jazz influence.\n\nBy the early 1980s a generation of New York City musicians had come of age playing both [[salsa (music)|salsa]] dance music and jazz. The time had come for a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers of Conjunto Libre (as the band was originally called). [[Jerry Gonzalez]] founded the jazz group the Fort Apache Band, which included his brother Andy and established a new standard for Latin jazz. During this same period, Tito Puente changed to performing and recording primarily Latin jazz for the remainder of his career. By 1989 Eddie Palmieri had also switched to playing mostly Latin jazz.\n\nThe 1980s saw salsa expand to Nicaragua, Argentina, Peru, Europe and Japan, and diversify into new stylistic interpretations. [[Oscar D'Le\u00f3n]] from Venezuela is a huge salsa star. In Colombia, a new generation of musicians began to combine salsa with elements of ''[[cumbia]]'' and ''[[vallenato]]''; this fusion tradition can be traced back to the 1960s work of Peregoyo y su Combo Vacana. However, it was [[Joe Arroyo]] and [[La Verdad (band)|La Verdad]], his band, that popularized Colombian salsa beginning in the 1980s.<ref>Steward 2000, pp. 379, 502</ref> The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of Colombian salsa in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger [[Fruko y sus Tesos]] (Fruko and his band Los Tesos).<ref>Steward 2000, pp. 493\u2013497</ref> [[Grupo Niche]] is based in [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], Colombia, and enjoys great popularity throughout Latin America. One of their biggest hits, \"Cali Pachanguero\" (1984), was seemingly arranged oblivious to clave.<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 182-183.</ref> As salsa grew and flourished in other countries, removed by both time and space from the New York epicenter, it adopted local sensibilities and drifted away from its Afro-Cuban moorings.\n\n{{wide image|Gatonegro Cali Noche desde Cristo Rey.jpg|800px|<center> A panoramic showing of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]], main city in western Colombia, where salsa is very popular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocuadrado.com/decoracion/content/cali-la-capital-mundial-de-la-salsa |title=Metrocuadrado.com |publisher=Metrocuadrado.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salsa.ch/news_view.php?idnews=178 |title=Cali: Capital Mundial de la Salsa |publisher=salsa.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbnoticias.com/vernoticia.asp?WPLACA=14272 |title=Cali ratific\u00f3 ser la capital mundial de la salsa |language=es|publisher=HSB Noticias |date=2017-05-13 |accessdate=2017-05-17}}</ref></center>\n}}\n\nThe 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth Puerto Rican [[salsa romantica]], with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, [[salsa erotica]]. Salsa romantica can be traced back to ''Noches Calientes'', a 1984 album by singer [[Jos\u00e9 Alberto]] with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audiences with a new style characterized by romantic lyrics, an emphasis on the melody over rhythm, and use of percussion breaks and chord changes.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 493; The crux of Steward's claims are confirmed by Leymarie 2003, p. 287, who nevertheless describes ''Noches Calientes'' as Ramirez's, with Ray de la Paz on vocals, without mentioning Alberto.</ref> Some viewed salsa romantica as a rhythmically watered-down version of the genre. Critics of ''salsa rom\u00e1ntica'', especially in the late 80s and early 90s, called it a commercialized, diluted form of Latin pop, in which formulaic, sentimental love ballads were simply put to Afro-Cuban rhythms\u2014leaving no room for classic salsa's brilliant musical improvisation, or for classic salsa lyrics that tell stories of daily life or provide social and political commentary. The marketing of ''salsa rom\u00e1ntica'' singers has often been based more on their youthful sex appeal than on the quality of their music. For these reasons, the form sometimes has been derided as ''salsa monga'' (limp or flaccid salsa), as opposed to ''salsa gorda'' or ''salsa dura'' (fat or 'hard salsa').Omar Alfanno is probably the most prolific songwriter in the salsa rom\u00e1ntica genre he was hand held into the business by Salsa Dura songwriter Johnny Ortiz. Other notable composers include Palmer Hernandez and Jorge Luis Piloto. Antonio \"Tony\" Moreno, [[Chino Rodriguez]], Sergio George and Julio \"Gunda\" Merced are some of the most notable producers in the salsa rom\u00e1ntica genre. Salsa lost popularity among many Latino youth, who were drawn to American rock in large numbers, while the popularization of Dominican merengue further sapped the audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico.<ref>Manuel 1990, p. 49</ref>\n\nAlong with the salsa-pop fusion of salsa rom\u00e1ntica, the 1980s saw the combining elements of salsa with soul, R&B, and [[hip hop music]]. The dilution of Afro-Cuban rhythmic principles created problems for some. Washburne recounts: \"As arrangers struggled to 'fit' these music styles into a salsa format, a variety of 'clave discrepancies,' or clashes, like in 'Cali Pachanguero,' often resulted. As the salsa style became more culturally diverse, Nuyorican and Puerto Rican traditionalists often reacted by emphatically positing clave as a representative of, or essential to, Puerto Rican cultural identity.\"<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 190.</ref>\n\n===\"Salsa cubana\" and the birth of timba===\nIn the mid-1980s salsa finally caught on in Cuba. However, the development of Salsa Cubana is drastically different. Moore:\n\n<blockquote>Venezuelan salsa star Oscar D'Le\u00f3n's 1983 tour of Cuba is mentioned prominently by every Cuban I've ever interviewed on the subject. Rub\u00e9n Blades' album ''Siembra'' was heard everywhere on the island throughout the mid-80s and has been quoted extensively in the gu\u00edas and coros of everyone from Van Van's Mayito Rivera (who quotes [Blades'] 'Pl\u00e1stico' in his gu\u00edas on the 1997 classic ''Ll\u00e9vala a tu vacil\u00f3n''), to El M\u00e9dico de la Salsa (quoting another major hook from 'Pl\u00e1stico'\u2014'se ven en la cara, se ven en la cara, nunca en el coraz\u00f3n'\u2014in his final masterpiece before leaving Cuba, ''Di\u00f3s sabe'').<ref>Moore, Kevin 2011 p. 73. ''Beyond Salsa Piano'' v. 11. ''C\u00e9sar \"Pupy\" Pedroso: The Music of Los Van Van, Part 2''. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com.{{ISBN|1460965426}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPrior to D'Le\u00f3n's performance, Cuban musicians had for the most part, rejected salsa, considering it bad imitation Cuban music. Something changed after d'Le\u00f3n's performance. By that time, Cuban popular music had moved way beyond the old Cuban templates used in salsa. Cuba's momentary \"salsa craze\" brought back some of those older templates. For example, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental started using the most common salsa timbale bell and bongo bell combination. That bell arrangement became the standard for timba, which emerged at the end of the 1980s.\n\nThe release of ''En la calle'' (1989) by [[NG La Banda]], marked the beginning of the post-songo era. This new music shared more with salsa than the Cuban music of the previous decade. Departing from the rumba-inspired percussion parts of the previous songo era, \"La expresiva\" uses typical salsa bell patterns creatively incorporated into a Cuban-style timbales/drum kit hybrid. The tumbadora ('conga') plays elaborate variations on the son montuno-based tumbao, rather than in the songo style. In contrast to salsa though, NG's bass tumbaos are busier, and rhythmically and harmonically more complex than typically heard in salsa. The breakdown sections in ''En la calle'' have more in common with both the folkloric guaguanc\u00f3 of that time, and hip-hop, than with salsa.\n\nSome Cuban musicians referred to this late-80s sound as ''salsa cubana'', a term which for the first time, included Cuban music as a part of salsa.<ref name=\"Maule\u00f3n 1999, p. 80\"/> In the mid-1990s California-based Bembe Records released CDs by several Cuban bands, as part of their ''salsa cubana series''. Those bands included Manolito y su Trabuco, Orquesta Sublime, and Irakere which was nominated for a Grammy. Other North American labels such as Qbadic and Xenophile also released CDs by contemporary Cuban bands. It would seem at last that Cuban popular music could be marketed as salsa. In 1997, the film and CD [[Buena Vista Social Club]], produced by [[Ry Cooder]], was a big hit in the United States. America \"discovered\" Cuban music once again. However, for the most part, the music of the BVSC and its spin-offs was from the pre-mambo era. They do not play salsa. One exception was the BVSC spin-off, the [[Afro-Cuban All Stars]]. When touring the United States the All Stars performed arrangements that began very much like salsa tunes, but they would also employ breakdowns about halfway through the pieces. The Buena Vista Social Club and its spin-off groups did not exist in Cuba as working bands. They were put together for touring outside of Cuba. The bands that were playing in Havana had meanwhile been steadily evolving into something quite distinctly Cuban, and less like salsa. The Cuban jazz pianist [[Gonzalo Rubalcaba]] developed a technique of pattern and harmonic displacement in the 1980s, which was adopted into [[timba]] guajeos in the 1990s. The guajeo (shown above) for Issac Delgado's \"La tem\u00e1tica\" (1997) demonstrates some of the innovations of timba piano. A series of repeated octaves invoke a characteristic metric ambiguity. Techniques like guajeo pattern displacement often make the music difficult for non-Cubans to dance to.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nThe term ''salsa cubana'' which had barely taken hold, eventually fell out of favor, and was replaced with ''[[timba]]''. Some of the other important timba bands include Az\u00facar Negra, Bamboleo, [[Manol\u00edn \"El M\u00e9dico de la salsa\"]]. [[Charanga Habanera]], Havana d'Primera, Klimax, [[Paulito FG]], Pupy y Los Que Son, Salsa Mayor, and Tiempo Libre. Cuban timba musicians and New York salsa musicians have had positive and creative exchanges over the years, but the two genres remain somewhat separated, appealing to different audiences. Nevertheless, some people today include Cuban groups in the salsa category.\n\n===African salsa===\n[[File:Orch baob 062608 001.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Orchestra Baobab]]\nCuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. To the Africans, clave-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic.<ref>Nigerian musician Segun Bucknor: \"Latin American music and our music is virtually the same\"\u2014quoted by Collins 1992 p. 62</ref> ''The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1''. states:\n\n<blockquote>Beginning in the 1940s, Afro-Cuban [son] groups such as Septeto Habanero and Trio Matamoros gained widespread popularity in the Congo region as a result of airplay over Radio Congo Belge, a powerful radio station based in L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa DRC). A proliferation of music clubs, recording studios, and concert appearances of Cuban bands in L\u00e9opoldville spurred on the Cuban music trend during the late 1940s and 1950s.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1''. 2010 p. 407.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCongolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with lyrics sung in French or Lingala, a lingua franca of the western Congo region. The Congolese called this new music ''rumba'', although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as [[soukous]].<ref>Roberts, John Storm. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''. Original Music cassette tape (1986).</ref>\n\nCuban popular music played a major role in the development of many contemporary genres of African popular music. John Storm Roberts states: \"It was the Cuban connection, but increasingly also New York salsa, that provided the major and enduring influences\u2014the ones that went deeper than earlier imitation or passing fashion. The Cuban connection began very early and was to last at least twenty years, being gradually absorbed and re-Africanized.\"<ref>Roberts 1986. 20: 50. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''.</ref> The re-working of Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns by Africans brings the rhythms full circle.\n\nThe re-working of the harmonic patterns reveals a striking difference in perception. The I IV V IV harmonic progression, so common in Cuban music, is heard in pop music all across the African continent, thanks to the influence of Cuban music. Those chords move in accordance with the basic tenets of Western music theory. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, performers of African popular music do not necessarily perceive these progressions in the same way: \"The harmonic cycle of C-F-G-F [I-IV-V-IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music.\"<ref>Kubik 1999 p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe largest wave of Cuban-based music to hit Africa was in the form of salsa. In 1974 the Fania All Stars performed in [[Zaire]] (known today as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa. This was captured on film and released as ''Live In Africa'' (''Salsa Madness'' in the UK). The Zairean appearance occurred  at a music festival held in conjunction with the [[Muhammad Ali]]/[[George Foreman]] [[Rumble in the Jungle|heavyweight title fight]]. Local genres were already well established by this time. Even so, salsa caught on in many African countries, especially in the Senegambia and Mali. Cuban music had been the favorite of Senegal's nightspot in the 1950s to 1960s.<ref>Stapleton 1990 116-117.</ref> The Senegalese band [[Orchestra Baobab]] plays in a basic salsa style with congas and timbales, but with the addition of Wolof and Mandinka instruments and lyrics.\n\nAccording to Lise Waxer, \"African salsa points not so much to a return of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of cultural appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World.\"<ref>Waxer 2002 p. 12.</ref> Since the mid-1990s African artists have also been very active through the super-group [[Africando]], where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, [[Ricardo Lemvo]], [[Ismael Lo]] and [[Salif Keita]]. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.\n\n===1990s to the present===\n[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Marc Anthony performing at the White House (2009).]]\nProducer and pianist [[Sergio George]] helped to revive salsa's commercial success in the 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like [[Tito Nieves]], [[La India]], and [[Marc Anthony]]. George also produced the Japanese salsa band [[Orquesta de la Luz]]. [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Son By Four]], [[V\u00edctor Manuelle]], and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English.<ref>Steward 2000, pp. 488\u2013499</ref> More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: \"Though clave is considered, it is not always the most important thing in my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. When I stopped trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave.\"<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 191. Sergio George quote.</ref> As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not always get a pass:\n\n<blockquote>Marc Anthony is a product of George's innovationist approach. As a novice to Latin music, he was propelled into band leader position with little knowledge of how the music was structured. One revealing moment came during a performance in 1994, just after he had launched his salsa career. During a piano solo he approached the timbales, picked up a stick, and attempted to play clave on the clave block along with the band. It became apparent that he had no idea where to place the rhythm. Shortly thereafter during a radio interview in San Juan Puerto Rico, he exclaimed that his commercial success proved that you did not need to know about clave to make it in Latin music. This comment caused an uproar both in Puerto Rico and New York. After receiving the bad press, Anthony refrained from discussing the subject in public, and he did not attempt to play clave on stage until he had received some private lessons.<ref>Washburne 2008 p. 192</ref></blockquote>\n\nSalsa remained a major part of Colombian music through the 1990s, producing popular bands like [[Sonora Carruseles]], while the singer [[Carlos Vives]] created his own style that blends salsa with [[vallenato]] and rock. Vives' popularization of [[vallenato-salsa]] led to the accordion-led vallenato style being used by mainstream pop stars such as [[Gloria Estefan]]. The city of [[Cali]], is known as Colombia's \"capital of salsa\", having produced such groups as Orquesta Guayacan, [[Grupo Niche]], songwriter [[Kike Santander]], and  Julian Collazos, the producer of the Marco Barrientos Band.<ref>Steward 2000, p. 504</ref> Cabijazz from Venezuela plays a unique blend of timba-like salsa with a strong jazz influence.\n\nThe most recent innovations in salsa genre include hybrids like [[Latin house]], salsa-merengue and [[salsaton]], alongside [[salsa gorda]].\n\n==Films==\n* 1979 - ''Salsa: Latin Music in the Cities''.

Krishna (Arun) is an aspiring director who comes to Araku for a test shoot and to complete the script of his debut film. Circle Inspector ([[Prakash Raj]]) has a wife and young kids. Chitra spent a year in a mental asylum because she witnessed her family being murdered. Chitra and Krishna become friends. While Chitra is looking through her binoculars, she witnesses a murder where she can clearly see the victim's face. Chitra reports the incident to the police, but they find no evidence of the crime. Chitra suspects that her past mental condition is relapsing. Eventually, the police finds out that the female victim did, in fact, exist. They have a CD that shows Circle Inspector and the female victim together in a store. The victim is none other than the Circle Inspector's dead girlfriend's daughter. He cannot acknowledge their illegitimate relation without tainting his reputation. It is revealed that he lured his daughter to Araku to kill her. Although Chitra witnessed the murder, the Circle Inspector tried to make it look like a figment of Chitra's imagination, and is infuriated when Chitra refuses to believe that the murder was her hallucination. Chitra and Krishna try to take the disc and escape, but Circle Inspector tries to kill Krishna, whose foot is injured by Krishna. Circle Inspector's holds Krishna at gunpoint, but Chitra refuses to give the disc to him. She slaps the Circle Inspector, who decides to let go of Krishna and commits suicide. Chitra says that she didn't think that Circle Inspector was going to kill her and Krishna because he already framed a dead officer for the victim's murder. Chitra and Krishna take the disc as evidence to the police.

Chitra and Krishna try to take the disc and escape, but Circle Inspector tries to kill Krishna, whose foot is injured by Krishna. Circle Inspector's holds Krishna at gunpoint, but Chitra refuses to give the disc to him. She slaps the Circle Inspector, who decides to let go of Krishna and commits suicide. Chitra says that she didn't think that Circle Inspector was going to kill her and Krishna because he already framed a dead officer for the victim's murder. Chitra and Krishna take the disc as evidence to the police. The film ends with the union of Chitra and Krishna.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Genelia D'Souza]] as Chitra Singh\n* [[Adith Arun]] as Krishna\n* [[Prakash Raj]]\n* [[Aamir Tameem]] as Raghu\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Soundtrack album by S.K.Balachandran\n| type         = \n| artist       = \n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 2009\n| genre        = Feature film soundtrack\n| length       = 19:54\n| label        = Vel Records\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:2000s Telugu-language films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-Telugu-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "JohnsonKumar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected and added Language of the soundtrack", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katha_(2009_film)"}

Karthik tries to interact with Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father, and ends up angering her. Unable to hide his feelings any longer, Karthik confesses his love for her; she does not respond. A few days later, Karthik learns from his sister that Jessie has gone to Kerala to visit her grandmother. He and Ganesh end up in Kerala to look for her. After several days, he finds her and apologises. She introduces him to her family in Kerala as her \"classmate\". Jessie denies she has any feelings for him but agrees to be his friend. On the train journey back home, however, the two get close and share a kiss. Karthik is convinced Jessie loves him; the two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Karthik, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father wouldn't give her hand in marriage to a Hindu. Consequently, due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Karthik, her parents learn of their supposed affair. They fix a match and schedule her wedding. The day arrives and midway through the ceremony, Jessie refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. Karthik, who had, without anyone's knowledge, come to Kerala to witness the wedding is ecstatic and secretly visits Jessie at her home. It is then that Jessie admits she has indeed fallen in love with him. Karthik and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents.\n\nAt this point of time, Karthik goes to [[Goa]] on a 45-day shoot, where he gets rather busy. Meanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refused to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Karthik and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Karthik, since he is travelling through less than ideal places, tells Jessie to stay in Chennai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie stops taking Karthik's calls and so he goes back one night to check on Jessie. He comes to know that Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents' disapproval. She says she has agreed to marry a boy of their choice. When Karthik pleads her not to do it, she tells him that a time had come when she was willing to elope, but the moment was gone. She doesn't want Karthik to wait for her too long, as he has his dreams to fulfill. Karthik later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad in UK.\n\nTwo years later, Karthik meets Nandini ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]). She falls in love with him, but is rejected by Karthik by saying that he hasn't yet gotten over Jessie. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon [[Naga Chaitanya|Naga Chaitanya Akkineni]] as the film's protagonist, Nandini as the female lead and Ganesh as the film's cinematographer, and the film is eventually titled ''Jessie''. While shooting for the film in New York, he sees Jessie and she comes to speak with him. She admits that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Karthik proposes yet again and they get married the same day. This is actually revealed to be the end scene in Karthik's movie \u2013 which Karthik and Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. After it gets over, it is revealed to the audience that Jessie had in fact seen Karthik in New York but had not come forward to meet him. She is married now and hence asks Karthik to move on. She tells Karthik that they cannot lead a life which is full of obstacles and they part, once and for all to lead different lives and different destinies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Silambarasan|Simbu]] as Karthik Sivakumar, a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]].<ref name=\"manorama\"/>\n* [[Trisha Krishnan|Trisha]] as Jessie Thekekuttu, a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] Syrian Catholic [[Malayali]] girl.<ref name=\"manorama\"/>\n* [[VTV Ganesh]] as Ganesh, a [[cinematographer]]\n* [[Babu Antony]] as Joseph Thekekuttu\n* [[Kitty (actor)|Kitty]] as Sivakumar\n* [[Uma Padmanabhan]] as Mrs. Sivakumar\n* Arjuna as Jerry Thekekuttu\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Teresa Thekekuttu\n* Trisha Alex as Karthik's sister\n* [[K.

Karthik tries to interact with Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father, and ends up angering her. Unable to hide his feelings any longer, Karthik confesses his love for her; she does not respond. A few days later, Karthik learns from his sister that Jessie has gone to Kerala to visit her grandmother. He and Ganesh end up in Kerala to look for her. After several days, he finds her and apologises. She introduces him to her family in Kerala as her \"classmate\". Jessie denies she has any feelings for him but agrees to be his friend. On the train journey back home, however, the two get close and share a kiss. Karthik is convinced Jessie loves him; the two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Karthik, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father wouldn't give her hand in marriage to a Hindu. Consequently, due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Karthik, her parents learn of their supposed affair. They fix a match and schedule her wedding. The day arrives and midway through the ceremony, Jessie refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. Karthik, who had, without anyone's knowledge, come to Kerala to witness the wedding is ecstatic and secretly visits Jessie at her home. It is then that Jessie admits she has indeed fallen in love with him. Karthik and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents.\n\nAt this point of time, Karthik goes to [[Goa]] on a 45-day shoot, where he gets rather busy. Meanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refused to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Karthik and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Karthik, since he is travelling through less than ideal places, tells Jessie to stay in Chennai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie stops taking Karthik's calls and so he goes back one night to check on Jessie. He comes to know that Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents' disapproval. She says she has agreed to marry a boy of their choice. When Karthik pleads her not to do it, she tells him that a time had come when she was willing to elope, but the moment was gone. She doesn't want Karthik to wait for her too long, as he has his dreams to fulfill. Karthik later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad in UK.\n\nTwo years later, Karthik meets Nandini ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]). She falls in love with him, but is rejected by Karthik by saying that he hasn't yet gotten over Jessie. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon [[Naga Chaitanya|Naga Chaitanya Akkineni]] as the film's protagonist, Nandini as the female lead and Ganesh as the film's cinematographer, and the film is eventually titled ''Jessie''. While shooting for the film in New York, he sees Jessie and she comes to speak with him. She admits that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Karthik proposes yet again and they get married the same day. This is actually revealed to be the end scene in Karthik's movie \u2013 which Karthik and Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. After it gets over, it is revealed to the audience that Jessie had in fact seen Karthik in New York but had not come forward to meet him. She is married now and hence asks Karthik to move on. She tells Karthik that they cannot lead a life which is full of obstacles and they part, once and for all to lead different lives and different destinies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Silambarasan|Simbu]] as Karthik Sivakumar, a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]].<ref name=\"manorama\"/>\n* [[Trisha Krishnan|Trisha]] as Jessie Thekekuttu, a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] Syrian Catholic [[Malayali]] girl.<ref name=\"manorama\"/>\n* [[VTV Ganesh]] as Ganesh, a [[cinematographer]]\n* [[Babu Antony]] as Joseph Thekekuttu\n* [[Kitty (actor)|Kitty]] as Sivakumar\n* [[Uma Padmanabhan]] as Mrs. Sivakumar\n* Arjuna as Jerry Thekekuttu\n* [[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]] as Teresa Thekekuttu\n* Trisha Alex as Karthik's sister\n* [[K.

Gwynedd|Penygroes]], [[Gwynedd]], Wales.{{sfn|Christiansen|1976|p=108}}\n\nThe [[narrow gauge]], horse-drawn [[Nantlle Railway]] had a station near the site from 1856 until 1865, when it was closed to be replaced and updated to standard gauge with contemporary facilities. It reopened in its eventual form in 1867 and closed in December 1964. The station served as the junction station{{sfn|Kneale|1980|loc=Plates 130 & 131}} for the short branch to {{rws|Nantlle}} which was overlain in 1872 on part of the former Nantlle Railway route, but its main purpose was for traffic on the former [[Carnarvonshire Railway]] line from {{rws|Caernarvon}} to {{rws|Afon Wen}} and beyond.{{sfn|Rear|2012|pp=41-46}}\n\nWhen the line and station were first opened in 1867 a locomotive was hired from the [[Cambrian Railways]]. A Cambrian driver, who had never been over the line before, was retained to drive the first directors' inspection special from {{rws|Afon Wen}} to {{rws|Carnarvon (Pant)}}. On the return journey the loco ran short of coal and ran out of steam at Penygroes. There was some peat in a nearby field, which the crew dug and the directors carried to the engine enabling steam to be raised.{{sfn|Dunn|September 1958|pp=595-6}}\n\nThe passenger service along the Nantlle Branch was withdrawn in 1932, though excursions continued until 1939. The station and line closed on 7 December 1964 as recommended in the [[Beeching Report]].\n\n{{Historical Rail Start}}\n{{rail line\n|next=[[Pant Glas railway station|Pant Glas]]<br><small>Line and Station closed</small>\n|previous=[[Groeslon railway station|Groeslon]]<br><small>Line and Station closed</small>\n|route=[[Carnarvonshire Railway]]|col={{LNWR colour}} }}\n{{rail line\n|previous=\n|next=[[Nantlle railway station|Nantlle]]<br><small>Line and Station closed</small>|\n|route=[[Carnarvonshire Railway|Carnarvonshire Railway<br><small>Nantlle Branch</small>]]\n|col={{LNWR colour}} }}\n{{s-end}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Baughan|first=Peter E. |title=A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: North and Mid Wales |series=Regional railway history series |year=1991 |edition=2nd |id=Vol 11 |publisher=David St John Thomas Publisher |location=Nairn |isbn=0 946537 59 3 |ol=11571058M |ref=harv }}\n* {{Butt-Stations}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Christiansen |first1=Rex |title=Forgotten Railways: North and Mid Wales |year=1976 |publisher=[[David and Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot, Devon |isbn=0 7153 7059 6 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/northmidwales00chri }}\n*{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=J.M. |editor1-first=B.W.C. |editor1-last=Cooke |date=September 1958 |title=The Afonwen Line-1 |journal=[[The Railway Magazine]] |volume=104 |issue=689 |publisher=Tothill Press Limited |location=London }}\n* {{Jowett-Atlas}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Kneale |first1=E.N. |title=North Wales Steam, 1927-68 |year=1980 |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co. |location=Poole, Dorset |isbn=0 86093 074 2 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Vic |last2=Smith |first2=Keith |title=Bangor to Portmadoc: Including Three Llanberis Lines |series=Country Railway Routes |year=2010 |publisher=Middleton Press |location=Midhurst |isbn=978 1 906008 72 7 |ref=harv }}\n* {{Quick-Stations}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Rear |first1=W.G. |title=Caernarvon & the Lines from Afonwen & Llanberis: 28: Scenes from the Past Railways of North Wales |year=2012 |publisher=Book Law Publications |location=Nottingham |isbn=9 781907 094781 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Shannon |first1=Paul |last2=Hillmer |first2=John |title=North Wales (British Railways Past & Present) Part 2 |year=1999 |id=No 36 |publisher=Past & Present Publishing Ltd |location=Kettering |isbn=1-85895-163-1 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Turner |first=Alun |title=Gwynedd's Lost Railways |year=2003 |publisher=Stenlake Publishing |location=Catrine, Ayrshire |isbn=9781840332599 |ref=harv }}\n\n==Further material==\n*{{cite DVD |last1=Clemens |first1=Jim |title=North Wales Steam Lines No. 6 (DVD) |year= 2003 |origyear=1959-67 |publisher=B&R Video Productions |location=Uffington, Shropshire |isbn= |id= BRVP No 79|ref=harv }}\n* {{cite magazine |department= |editor1-first=Martin |editor1-last=Smith |date=May 2011 |title=The Nantlle Tramway |magazine=Railway Bylines |volume=16 |issue=6 |pp=306-313 |publisher=Irwell Press |location=Clophill, Bedfordshire |issn=1360-2098 |ref={{sfnref|Railway Bylines|2011}} }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=17&lat=53.0525&lon=-4.2894&layers=6&b=1 The station site on a navigable OS Map, via ''National Library of Scotland'']\n* [http://www.RailMapOnline.com/UKIEMap.php?lat=53.05204&lng=-4.28868 The station and line, via ''Rail Map Online'']\n* [http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/elrs/_mileages/C/CNV.txt The line CNV with mileages, via ''Railway Codes'']\n* [https://uk.images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A9mSs2ReMptXZK4AwxFLBQx.;_ylu=X3oDMTByZmVxM3N0BGNvbG8DaXIyBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--?p=Penygroes+Station&fr=mcafee Images of the station, via ''Yahoo'']\n* [http://www.nantlle.com/history-y-groeslon-brief.htm The station, via ''Nantlle Valley History'']\n* [http://www.lnwrs.org.uk/BygoneLines/AfonWen.php The station and line, via ''LNWR Society'']\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAjZecLvzKM By DMU from Pwllheli to Amlwch, via ''Huntley Archives'']\n\n{{Closed stations Gwynedd}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Penygroes Railway Station}}\n[[Category:Beeching closures in Wales]]\n[[Category:Disused railway stations in Gwynedd]]\n[[Category:Llanllyfni]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1867]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1964]]\n[[Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations]]\n", "name_user": "Nempnet", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed Dunn citation anchor", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penygroes_railway_station"}
