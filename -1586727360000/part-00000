Knight struck a deal with him that in October, paying his bail, freed him from prison\u2014pending his conviction's appeal\u2014while signing him to Deathrow Records. In 1996, the label released 2Pac's greatest commercial success, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Yet that September, after departing a Mike Tyson boxing match in Las Vegas, a group that included Knight and Shakur assaulted [[Orlando Anderson]], a Southside Compton [[Crips]] gang member. Three hours later someone shot into the car that Knight was driving and fatally wounded Shakur, and Anderson has since become the prime suspect.\n\nIn the fallout from and the aftermath of Shakur's death, both Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg left Deathrow Records. Rapidly, the label declined, and it was soon eclipsed. Meanwhile, allegations mounted that Knight, beyond employing gang members, had often plied intimidation and violence in his business dealings. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Knight spent a few years incarcerated for assault convictions and associated violations of [[probation]] and [[parole]]. In September 2018, upon pleading [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to [[voluntary manslaughter]] in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run, Knight was sentenced to 28 years in prison.<ref name=\"thewrap92018\">{{cite news |last= Kenneally |first=Tim |title= Suge Knight to Serve 28 Years Over 2015 Hit-and-Run Death |url= https://www.thewrap.com/suge-knight-to-serve-28-years-2015-hit-run-death/ |accessdate = September 20, 2018|work=[[TheWrap]] |date= September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"latimesfeb2015\">{{cite news |last1=Gerber |first1=Marisa |title='Suge' Knight charged with murder; could face life in prison |url= http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-suge-knights-bail-revoked-20150202-story.html |accessdate=February 3, 2015 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 2, 2015}}</ref> He is scheduled to become eligible for parole in October 2037.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Details.aspx?ID=BH6458|title=Inmate Information|last=|first=|date=|website=CDCR Inmate Locator|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMarion Hugh Knight Jr. was born in [[Compton, California]], the son of Maxine (n\u00e9e Dikemen) and Marion Knight Sr.<ref name=\"Chosen by Fate\">{{cite book |last=Lee |first1=McKinley |last2=Williams |first2=Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gp-fAAAAMAAJ&q=Maxine+Chatman&dq=Maxine+Chatman |title=Chosen by Fate: My Life Inside Death Row Records |location=West Hollywood, CA |publisher=Dove Books |year=1997 |isbn=9780787114329 |accessdate=January 31, 2015 }}</ref> His name Suge (pronounced ''Shoog'') derives from \"Sugar Bear\", a childhood nickname.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D91039F937A25752C0A960958260 |title=Does a Sugar Bear Bite? |last=Hirschberg |first=Lynn |work=The New York Times |date=February 2, 1997 |accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref> He attended [[Lynwood High School]] in nearby [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], where he was a [[American football|football]] and [[Track and field|track]] star.

His first big profit in the business came when [[Vanilla Ice]] (Robert Van Winkle) agreed to sign over royalties from his smash hit \"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\", because the song included material allegedly written by Knight's client Mario Johnson. Knight and his bodyguards confronted Van Winkle several times. On one occasion, Knight entered Van Winkle's hotel room and allegedly dangled him by his ankles off the balcony.

In 1995, he ran afoul of activist [[C.

Openly critical of Combs's tendency of ad-libbing on his artists' songs and dancing in their videos, Knight announced to the audience, \"Anyone out there who wanna be a recording artist and wanna stay a star, and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.\"\n\nThe same year, Knight offered to post bail ({{US$|1.4{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}) for Tupac Shakur if the rapper agreed to sign with Death Row.

Tupac Shakur was shot four times in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13. When Shakur's [[Gangsta rap#East Coast hardcore hip hop and the East Coast-West Coast feud|East Coast rival]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] ([[Pseudonym|AKA]] Biggie Smalls), was murdered in a similar drive-by shooting in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on March 9, 1997, speculation arose that Knight was involved and that Biggie's death was a revenge killing.<ref name=\"Kading1\">[http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/10/tupac_biggie_murder_video.php VIDEO: Greg Kading's Book Says Sean Combs, Suge Knight Ordered Tupac and Biggie Killings] By LA Weekly Mon., October 3, 2011</ref> Former Death Row artists, including Snoop Dogg, also later accused Knight of being involved in Tupac's murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/snoopBeefs.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329040342/http://www.rapcentral.co.uk/snoopBeefs.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 29, 2007|title=RapCentral.co.uk - SNOOP DOGG BEEF INFO FOR ALL HIS BEEFS WITH SUGE KNIGHT, THE EASTSIDAZ AND MORE|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA theory accusing Suge Knight in the deaths of both Biggie and Tupac was that of ex-detective [[Russell Poole]], who conjectured that Knight had Tupac killed before he could part ways with Knight's label and then conspired to kill Biggie to divert attention from himself in the Tupac case.<ref name=\"Broomfield's Biggie and Tupac reviewed by the Courant\">{{cite news|last=Danton|first=Eric|title=Biggie (rip) Vs.

Hackie had implicated Suge Knight and [[David Mack (police officer)|David Mack]]. Hackie, a former Death Row associate, said that he had knowledge of involvement between Suge Knight and David Mack and other LAPD officers.

Knight struck a deal with him that in October, paying his bail, freed him from prison\u2014pending his conviction's appeal\u2014while signing him to Deathrow Records. In 1996, the label released 2Pac's greatest commercial success, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Yet that September, after departing a Mike Tyson boxing match in Las Vegas, a group that included Knight and Shakur assaulted [[Orlando Anderson]], a Southside Compton [[Crips]] gang member. Three hours later someone shot into the car that Knight was driving and fatally wounded Shakur, and Anderson has since become the prime suspect.\n\nIn the fallout from and the aftermath of Shakur's death, both Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg left Deathrow Records. Rapidly, the label declined, and it was soon eclipsed. Meanwhile, allegations mounted that Knight, beyond employing gang members, had often plied intimidation and violence in his business dealings. From the late 1990s into the early 2000s, Knight spent a few years incarcerated for assault convictions and associated violations of [[probation]] and [[parole]]. In September 2018, upon pleading [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to [[voluntary manslaughter]] in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run, Knight was sentenced to 28 years in prison.<ref name=\"thewrap92018\">{{cite news |last= Kenneally |first=Tim |title= Suge Knight to Serve 28 Years Over 2015 Hit-and-Run Death |url= https://www.thewrap.com/suge-knight-to-serve-28-years-2015-hit-run-death/ |accessdate = September 20, 2018|work=[[TheWrap]] |date= September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"latimesfeb2015\">{{cite news |last1=Gerber |first1=Marisa |title='Suge' Knight charged with murder; could face life in prison |url= http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-suge-knights-bail-revoked-20150202-story.html |accessdate=February 3, 2015 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 2, 2015}}</ref> He is scheduled to become eligible for parole in October 2037.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Details.aspx?ID=BH6458|title=Inmate Information|last=|first=|date=|website=CDCR Inmate Locator|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMarion Hugh Knight Jr. was born in [[Compton, California]], the son of Maxine (n\u00e9e Dikemen) and Marion Knight Sr.<ref name=\"Chosen by Fate\">{{cite book |last=Lee |first1=McKinley |last2=Williams |first2=Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gp-fAAAAMAAJ&q=Maxine+Chatman&dq=Maxine+Chatman |title=Chosen by Fate: My Life Inside Death Row Records |location=West Hollywood, CA |publisher=Dove Books |year=1997 |isbn=9780787114329 |accessdate=January 31, 2015 }}</ref> His name Suge (pronounced ''Shoog'') derives from \"Sugar Bear\", a childhood nickname.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D91039F937A25752C0A960958260 |title=Does a Sugar Bear Bite? |last=Hirschberg |first=Lynn |work=The New York Times |date=February 2, 1997 |accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref> He attended [[Lynwood High School]] in nearby [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], where he was a [[American football|football]] and [[Track and field|track]] star.

In 1989, Knight formed his own music publishing company. His first big profit in the business came when [[Vanilla Ice]] (Robert Van Winkle) agreed to sign over royalties from his smash hit \"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\", because the song included material allegedly written by Knight's client Mario Johnson. Knight and his bodyguards confronted Van Winkle several times. On one occasion, Knight entered Van Winkle's hotel room and allegedly dangled him by his ankles off the balcony. Van Winkle said only that Knight threatened to throw him off the balcony; the claim was resolved in court.<ref name=\"SKbio\" />\n\nKnight next formed an artist management company and signed prominent [[West Coast hip hop]] artists [[DJ Quik]] and [[The D.O.C.]] Through the latter, he met several members of the seminal [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]].\n\n==Death Row Records==\nDr. Dre and The D.O.C. wanted to leave both N.W.A and their label, [[Ruthless Records]], run by [[Eazy-E]], another member of N.W.A.

The following year, he opened a private, by-appointment-only nightclub in Las Vegas called Club 662, so named because the numbers spelled out ''MOB'' on telephone keypads, ''MOB'' standing for Member of [[Bloods]]. In 1995, he ran afoul of activist [[C. Delores Tucker]], whose criticism of Death Row's glamorization of the \"gangsta\" lifestyle may have helped scuttle a lucrative deal with [[Time Warner]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019|reason=Possibly baseless claim}}\n\n===Tupac Shakur, MC Hammer, Dr. Dre, and the Death Row Label===\nKnight's feud with East Coast entrepreneur [[Sean Combs]] (\"Puff Daddy\") progressed when Knight insulted the [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]] label founder on air at the [[Source Awards]] in August 1995. Openly critical of Combs's tendency of ad-libbing on his artists' songs and dancing in their videos, Knight announced to the audience, \"Anyone out there who wanna be a recording artist and wanna stay a star, and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.\"\n\nThe same year, Knight offered to post bail ({{US$|1.4{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}) for Tupac Shakur if the rapper agreed to sign with Death Row.

Hackie, a former Death Row associate, said that he had knowledge of involvement between Suge Knight and David Mack and other LAPD officers.
